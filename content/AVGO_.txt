manufacturing operations 

we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable lowcost operating model accordingly we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing thirdparty foundry and assembly and test capabilities as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions the majority of our frontend wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” we use thirdparty contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations including advanced semiconductor engineering inc foxconn technology group amkor technology inc and siliconware precision industries co ltd we use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes such as our fbar filters for wireless communications and our verticalcavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasersbased on gaas and inp lasers for fiber optic communications while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard cmos by doing so we can protect our ip and accelerate time to market for our products the majority of our internal iiiv semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the us and singapore 

we also have a long history of operating in asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials we store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in malaysia and our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities 

manufacturing materials and suppliers 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis these purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for redesign or qualification to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we may use a number of techniques including redesigning products for alternative components making incremental or “lifetime” purchases or qualifying more than one source of supply our longterm relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans and to monitor our suppliers financial health some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique or highly specialized components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all 

competition 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market additionally our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors including quality technical performance price product features product system 

compatibility systemlevel design capability engineering expertise responsiveness to customers new product innovation product availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 

in the semiconductor market we compete with integrated device manufacturers fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems our primary competitors are amlogic inc analog devices inc advanced micro devices inc cisco systems inc wolfspeed inc fka cree inc globalfoundries inc hamamatsu photonics kk heidenhain corporation hisilicon technologies co ltd ichaus gmbh intel corporation lumentum holdings inc macom technology solutions holdings inc maxlinear inc marvell technology inc mediatek inc nvidia corporation microchip technology incorporated mitsubishi electric corporation murata manufacturing co ltd nxp semiconductors nv on semiconductor corporation osram licht ag qorvo inc qualcomm inc realtek semiconductor corp renesas electronics corporation skyworks solutions inc stmicroelectronics nv sumitomo corporation synaptics incorporated tdkepc corporation toshiba corporation texas instruments inc and iivi incorporated we compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise fbar technology amplifier design module integration proprietary materials processes multiple storage protocols and mixedsignal design our broad product portfolio support of key industry standards reputation for quality products and our customer relationships

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade secrets and similar ip as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through security measures to protect our trade secrets we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 

as of october 30 2022 we had 17035 us and other patents and 618 us and other pending patent applications the expiration dates of our patents range from 2022 to 2041 with a small number of patents expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 

we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 

we and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of ip licensing and crosslicensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors a portion of our revenue comes from ip licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such ip we also license thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities products and manufacturing processes historically licenses of the thirdparty technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty ip infringement claims arising from our products claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us with respect to any ip rights claims against us or our customers or distributors we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation cease manufacturing the infringing products pay damages expend resources to develop noninfringing technology seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or relinquish patents or other ip rights 

with respect to our infrastructure software the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products rather onpremise customers typically access only the executable code for our products and saas customers access only the functionality of our saas offerings under certain contingent circumstances some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow 

arrangement that would enables them to obtain a limited right to access and use our source code if specific conditions are met 

employees 

our success depends on our continued ability to attract motivate and retain our workforce as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset competition for these and other talented employees is significant in many locations where we operate such as silicon valley and southeast asia 

we measure our employees’ engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and employee feedback our global voluntary attrition rate in fiscal year 2022 was approximately 65 below the technology industry benchmark aon 2022 salary increase and turnover study — second edition september 2022 

we also track the portion of our workforce in research and development roles as of october 30 2022 we had approximately 20000 employees worldwide with approximately 63 in research and development roles by geography approximately 54 of our employees are located in north america 35 in asia and 11 in europe the middle east and africa 

governmental regulation 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health safety and the environment these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air water and soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we are also subject to regulation by the us occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 

we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements including legislation enacted in the us european union and china among a growing number of jurisdictions which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead among other restricted substances in electronic products which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging in addition our business is subject to various importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders and rules of industrial standards bodies like the international organization for standardization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal trade commission “ftc” these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time we may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products these products have historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile devices manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly with our wireless communications products we have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification

risks related to our business 

adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 

a general slowdown in the global economy including a recession or in a particular region or industry an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and results of operations macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expenses and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of trade tensions between the us and china has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in chinese markets or compete effectively with chinese companies sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the us and its trading partners especially china and possible 

decoupling of the us and china economies could result in a global economic slowdown and longterm changes to global trade such events may also i cause our customers and consumers to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers and iv intensify pricing pressures any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by price erosion wide fluctuations in product supply and demand constant and rapid technological change evolving technical standards frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used from time to time these factors together with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular the industry recently experienced a significant upturn due to the supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices it is possible that this recent industry upcycle will be followed by a downturn and historically such downcycles have been characterized by diminished demand for enduser products high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix accelerated erosion of average selling prices and elimination of expedite fees leading to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors for america act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease in average selling prices we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable if we cannot offset industry or market downturns our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on a small number of end customers oems their respective contract manufacturers “cms” and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue for fiscal year 2022 sales to distributors accounted for 56 of our net revenue we believe aggregate sales through all channels to apple and our top five end customers accounted for approximately 20 and 35 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2022 respectively this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant customers 

our semiconductor customers are not generally required to purchase specific quantities of products even when customers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us such arrangements often include pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect as a result we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements moreover our top customers’ purchasing power has in some cases given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and should we fail to perform under these arrangements we could also be liable for significant monetary damages 

the loss of or any substantial reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes cms such as thirdparty wafer foundries and module assembly and test capabilities our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with a particular cm 

we depend on our cms to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis we do not generally have longterm capacity commitments with our cms and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities further our cms may fail to timely develop new advanced manufacturing processes including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies or from time to time will cease to or will become unable to manufacture a component for us as lead times to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new cm is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraints on our ability to change cms in addition qualifying new cms is often expensive and they may not produce products as costeffectively as our current suppliers 

tsmc one of our cms manufactured approximately 90 of the wafers manufactured by our cms during fiscal year 2022 we believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of tsmc’s total production capacity however tsmc also fabricates wafers for other companies including some of our competitors and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice in addition tsmc has and may in the future raise their prices to us 

if any of the foregoing circumstances occur we may be unable to meet our customer demand or to the same extent as our competitors fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities this has in the past damaged and may in the future damage our relationships with our customers this could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations payment of significant damages and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition results of operations and gross margin 

further any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize including tsmc’s supply of wafers to us as a result of a natural disaster climate change water shortages political unrest military conflicts geopolitical turmoil trade tensions government orders medical epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationships and results of operations 

we purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing processes and those of our cms rely on many materials including silicon gaas and inp wafers copper lead frames precious and rare earth metals mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases during fiscal year 2022 we purchased approximately twothirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials providers some of which are single source suppliers as certain materials are highly specialized the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source we do not generally have longterm contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases capacity constraints inflation or other factors any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry for example due to the covid19 pandemic we have experienced some supply constraints and increases in prices including with respect to wafers and substrates additionally the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the us and its trading partners particularly china the supply constraints have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our customer relationships further continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties 

our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements including anticompetition and importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice and have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations the us government may also add companies to its restricted entity list andor technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue for example huawei technologies co ltd one of our customers is subject to certain us export restrictions which has required us to suspend sales to huawei until we obtain licenses from the us department of commerce we may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them these restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on us companies by other governments especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with china will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our products and operations are also subject to regulation by us and nonus regulatory agencies such as the ftc from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries such as the ongoing investigation by the korean fair trade commission into certain of our contracting and business practices which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anticompetition legislation regulation administrative rule making and enforcement activity involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel 

if any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments andor cease certain conduct andor modify our contracting or business practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties 

in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur for example if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt crossborder manufacturing relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to comply with these requirements we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution 

global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a majority of our products are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition as of october 30 2022 nearly 49 of our employees were located outside the us multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

• changes in political regulatory legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil including chinataiwan relations including terrorism war or political or military coups statesponsored or politically motivated cyberattacks or civil disturbances or political instability foreign and domestic 

• restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments data privacy regulations imposition of climate change regulations and trade protection measures including increasing protectionism importexport restrictions including with regards to advanced technologies importexport duties and quotas trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs all of which have increased in recent years 

• difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support and transportation delays 

• potential inability to localize software products 

• difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners 

• public health or safety concerns medical epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and other natural or manmade disasters 

• nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets and 

• changes in us and foreign tax laws 

a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business in addition the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may in some cases conflict with each other although our policies prohibit us our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices there can be no assurance that all of our employees distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anticorruption or other policies and procedures any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted normal business activity which has impacted how we operate our business 

the covid19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted and reduced the efficiency of normal business activities in much of the world we experienced some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation as a result of these supply chain disruptions we increased customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation we are also largely building semiconductor products to order and this has limited and may continue to limit our ability to fulfill orders and satisfy all of the demand for our products 

the pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions quarantines shelterinplace order and factory and office shutdowns that impacted our workforce and 

operations and those of our customers cms suppliers and logistics providers in addition disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure impacted delivery times for materials and components to our facilities transfers of our products to our key suppliers and in some cases our ability to timely ship our products to customers this resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays which could recur in the event of any future closures of or periods of reduced operations at our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers 

in response to the pandemic we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities however existing or new precautionary measures or modifications in our business practices and policies may negatively impact our business or operations especially if the spread of covid19 including any variants worsens significantly in addition any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of covid19related claims if a significant number of our employees or employees and third parties performing key functions including our chief executive officer and members of our board of directors become ill our business may be further adversely impacted in addition changes to state workers’ compensation laws such as those in california may increase our potential liability for such claims see also our risk factor “ if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively ” 

the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control including the extent of actions to contain the virus including any variants availability and efficacy of the vaccines or other treatments public acceptance of the vaccines including boosters and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume 

we are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners including product inventory levels and product sellthrough 

we sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally sales to distributors accounted for 56 of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended october 30 2022 and are subject to a number of risks including 

• fluctuations in demand based on our distributors’ product inventory levels and end customer demand 

• our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers 

• our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause 

• our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers and 

• our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these products 

in addition we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks 

we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products as a result our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical devices and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications in such event failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 

our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team 

our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management team and in particular the services of hock e tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel including cyber security experts are a significant asset competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate particularly 

in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand in addition current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers further limiting the pool of available talent we believe equity awards provide a powerful longterm retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees however the amendments to our 2012 stock incentive plan approved by our stockholders in 2021 significantly reduced the number of shares available for equity awards as a result we may need to change our current equity granting philosophy which could impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive employment benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to complete our acquisition of vmware inc may adversely affect our business and our stock price 

consummation of the vmware merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including i the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the european union and certain other jurisdictions ii the receipt by vmware of a tax opinion regarding the us federal income tax treatment of certain aspects of the vmware merger iii the absence of certain orders or laws preventing consummation of the vmware merger iv authorization for listing additional shares of broadcom common stock on nasdaq and v the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to either us or vmware there can be no assurance that these or other closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits when expected if at all if the vmware merger is not completed our stock price could decline to the extent it reflects an assumption that we will complete the acquisition furthermore if the vmware merger is not completed we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business results of operations and stock price including incurring significant acquisition costs that we would be unable to recover negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community additionally under certain specified circumstances including the termination by either us or vmware because certain required regulatory clearances are not obtained upon termination we would be required to pay vmware a termination fee of 15 billion 

failure to realize the benefits expected from the vmware merger could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

although we expect significant benefits to result from the vmware merger there can be no assurance that we will actually realize any of them or realize them within the anticipated timeframe achieving these benefits will depend in part on our ability to integrate vmwares business successfully and efficiently the challenges involved in this integration which will be complex and time consuming include the following 

• preserving customer and other important relationships of vmware and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• integrating financial forecasting and controls procedures and reporting cycles 

• consolidating and integrating corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures 

• coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities 

• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated and 

• integrating employees and related hr systems and benefits maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees 

if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating an acquired business then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the vmware merger on our anticipated timeframe or at all and our revenue expenses operating results financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected the successful integration of the vmware business will require significant management attention both before and after the completion of the vmware merger and may divert the attention of management from our business and operational issues 

we may pursue acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities 

any acquisitions we may undertake including the vmware merger and their integration involve risks and uncertainties such as 

• unexpected delays challenges and related expenses and disruption of our business 

• diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities 

• incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense assuming liabilities some of which may be unexpected and ongoing or new lawsuits potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements 

• the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business as well as implementing our own management information systems operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations 

• our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired business’ products financial disclosures accounting practices legal tax and other contingencies compliance with local laws and regulations and interpretations thereof in the us and multiple international jurisdictions 

• additional acquisitionrelated debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow 

• dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders 

• difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees vendors and customers and 

• inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction 

in addition current and future changes to the us and foreign regulatory approval process and requirements related to acquisitions including the vmware merger may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions which may prevent the transaction or jeopardize delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and impede the execution of our business strategy 

from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investments any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us or at all disruption to other parts of our business potential loss of employees or customers or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions in addition dispositions may include the transfer of technology andor the licensing of certain ip rights to thirdparty purchasers which could limit our ability to utilize such ip rights or assert these rights against such thirdparty purchasers or other third parties 

we may be involved in legal proceedings including ip securities litigation and employeerelated claims which could among other things divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip rights 

we are often involved in legal proceedings including cases involving our ip rights and those of others commercial matters acquisitionrelated suits securities class action suits employeerelated claims and other actions litigation or settlement of such actions regardless of their merit can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel 

the industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including actions by patentholding companies that do not make or sell products from time to time third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their ip rights to technologies that are important to our business for example in august 2020 judgment was entered against broadcom and apple for infringement of certain patents and california institute of technology was awarded past damages of 2702 million from broadcom and 8378 million from apple for which apple is seeking indemnification from broadcom although the appellate court recently vacated these damages and ordered a new trial there are no assurances that we will be successful or what if any damages we will be required to pay 

many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements andor the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for thirdparty ip infringement claims including costs to defend those claims and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings however our cms and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such thirdparty claims claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could be required to 

• cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing products processes or technology andor make changes to our processes or products 

• pay substantial damages for past present and future use of the infringing technology including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found 

• expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 

• license technology from the thirdparty claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

• enter into crosslicenses with our competitors which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories 

• pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with noninfringing technology or 

• relinquish ip rights associated with one or more of our patent claims 

any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with such litigation these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals as well as stockholder derivative suits civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed 

our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control in addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section these factors include among others 

• the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in enduser demand for our customers’ the products 

• fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers 

• the shift to cloudbased it solutions and services such as hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers 

• the timing of new software contracts and renewals as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any prepaid amounts under the contract 

• our ability to timely develop introduce and market new products and technologies 

• the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue and other nonproduct revenue 

• new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors 

• seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets 

• timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies and 

• timing of any regulatory changes particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs and tax reform 

the foregoing factors are often difficult to predict and these as well as other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results in addition a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time 

failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

we make significant decisions including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept production schedules levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements which may not be accurate 

during the covid19 pandemic we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges more typically however to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts which are not binding as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence because certain of our sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income 

conversely customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice if we are unable to meet such increases in demand this could damage our customer relationships reduce revenue growth and margins subject us to additional liabilities harm our reputation and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities 

winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue 

our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes 

winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer a delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time may strain our resources and those of our cms in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses further often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products andor the manufacturing line for those products the qualification process can take significant time and resources delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue finally customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 

competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements often aggressive pricing practices and in some cases new delivery methods we expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets 

some of our competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition a larger installed customer base larger technical staffs more established relationships with vendors or suppliers or greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development technical and marketing resources than us we also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry open source authors who provide software and ip for free competitors who offer their products through tryandbuy or freemium models and customers who develop competing products 

in addition the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape we expect this trend to continue which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets a larger customer base a more comprehensive ip portfolio or better patent protection than us 

the actions of our competitors in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular could have a substantial adverse impact on us further competitors may leverage their superior market position as well as ip or other proprietary information including interface interoperability or technical information in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities research and development facilities warehouses or other significant operations or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes our fort collins and breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the fbar components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphidebased wafers used in our fibre optics products respectively many of our facilities and those of our cms and suppliers are located in california and the pacific rim region which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the czech republic india israel and the us with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas and our primary warehouse is in malaysia 

a prolonged disruption at or shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses especially our colorado singapore malaysia and pennsylvania facilities or those of our cms or suppliers due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness including covid19 or for any other reason would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found to date we have not experienced a material event however such event could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose us to claims by our customers result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand from time to time this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities which often involves substantial cost and other risks such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation forgo sales or lose customers as a result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed all of which could adversely affect our results of operations similarly reduced product yields due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers all of which could cause us to forgo sales incur liabilities or lose customers and harm our results of operations 

an impairment of the confidentiality integrity or availability of our it systems or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business depends on various internally managed it systems and outsourced it services including cloudbased and other critical corporate infrastructure services relating to among other things financial reporting product orders and shipping human resources benefit plan administration it network development network monitoring and electronic communication services as well as thirdparty data centers any failure of these internal or thirdparty systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our it infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect although these systems are designed to protect and secure our customers’ suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information as well as our own proprietary information we are out of necessity dependent on our vendors to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems in addition software products we use including technologies produced by us have occasionally had in the past and may have in the future vulnerabilities that if left unmanaged could reduce the overall level of security of the systems on which the software is installed 

cyberattacks are increasing in number and sophistication are wellfinanced in some cases supported by state actors and are designed to not only attack but also to evade detection since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures geopolitical instability such as russia’s invasion of ukraine may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or collateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nationstates or other politically motivated actors targeting critical technology infrastructure accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of our service providers or the existence of computer viruses or malware such as ransomware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss business disruption and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties such an event could disrupt our business and result in among other things unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information significant remediation costs disruption of key business operations and significant diversion of our resources as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations such as the general data protection regulation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform we may be unable to collect any damages 

despite our internal controls and investment in security measures we have from time to time been subject to disruptive cyberattacks or there have been attempts of unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own it networks although no such cyber security incidents have been material to broadcom we continue to devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future 

us and foreign regulators have also increased their focus on cyber security vulnerabilities and risks compliance with laws and regulations concerning privacy cyber security data governance and data protection could result in significant expense and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties further customers and service providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual certification and audit provisions regarding privacy cyber security data governance data protection confidentiality and ip which may also increase our overall compliance burden 

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our product mix price erosion acquisitions we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity prices 

our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and nonproduct revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternatives more complex engineering requirements lower demand industry oversupply or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin conversely periods of robust demand that create a supply imbalance as we have seen recently can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term 

in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin furthermore we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices some of which are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 

our gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and by expenses related to such acquisitions 

we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants we spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights including the unauthorized use of our products usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect the ip rights that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that 

• our ip rights will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged or in the case of thirdparty ip rights licensed to us be licensed to others 

• our ip rights will provide competitive advantages to us 

• rights previously granted by third parties to ip licensed or assigned to us including portfolio crosslicenses will not hamper our ability to assert our ip rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes 

• any of our pending or future patent trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 

• our ip rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak or 

• we have sufficient ip rights to protect our products or our business 

effective ip protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the us and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions in addition when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 

we also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip rights particularly exclusive licenses may limit our ability to assert those ip rights against third parties including the licensee of those rights in addition we may acquire companies with ip that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties these licensing obligations may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip rights from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights including in some cases against our customers and suppliers claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us conversely third parties have and may in the future pursue ip litigation against us including as a result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments which could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 

if our software products do not remain compatible with everchanging operating environments platforms or thirdparty products demand for our products and services could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business 

we may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities w e must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments 

further our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties if we lose access to thirdparty code and specifications for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software providers and hardware manufacturers including some of our largest vendors adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems applications or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business 

many of our existing customers have multiyear enterprise software license agreements some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope on terms that are commercially attractive to us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense 

some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive the loss of these licenses or the inability to 

maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products 

certain software we use is from open source code sources which under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

some of our products contain software from open source code sources the use of which may subject us to certain conditions including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available further although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements it is common for such software to be available “asis” with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions such use under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 

failure of our software products to manage and secure it infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business 

certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure it infrastructures and environments and as a result we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks open source code or other thirdparty software used in these products could also be targeted although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers additionally efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers a successful cyber security attack involving our products could cause customers and potential customers to believe our services are ineffective or unreliable and result in among other things the loss of customers unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation difficulty in marketing our products allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations and give rise to significant costs including costs related to developing solutions or indemnification obligations under our agreements any such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of operations see also “ an impairment of the confidentiality integrity or availability of our it systems or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business ” 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters for example it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 

highly complex products such as those we offer may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions software documentation or enhancements are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development if any of our products or thirdparty components used in our products contain defects or bugs or have reliability quality or compatibility problems we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall repair or replacement costs significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of thirdparty software 

applications and databases as a result if there is systemwide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s system it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to resolve these problems we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected product or products these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others for example if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s endproduct delivery we may be required under the terms of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays as a result our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements short product cycles and evolving industry standards and new delivery methods in addition semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our products may be reduced increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use and store collectively “process” a high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business this creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business depending on the type of personal information the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments privacy legislation and other data protection regulations enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment sectoral legislation certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers such as those is the financial services or public sector are likely to further exacerbate this trend the cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security business process business record or data localization requirements concerns about government interference sovereignty expanding privacy cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services particularly in cloud computing artificial intelligence and our own data management practices the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation substantial fines and damages and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws which could increase our costs restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the use disposal cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could among other things require us to modify our manufacturing processes restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronic products sold in various countries including the us china and japan and in the european union increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to reengineer our products such reengineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may also experience claims from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims 

social and environmental regulations policies and provisions as well as customer and investor demands may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors 

there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions an increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies practices and metrics in addition various jurisdictions are developing climate changebased laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these legal and regulatory requirements as well as investor expectations on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or cms to comply with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

in addition as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

the average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit 

the semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications as a result the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by among other things pricing pressures from our customers in the past we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors in addition some of our customer agreements provide for volumebased pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes reducing manufacturing costs or developing new and higher valueadded products on a timely basis 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses 

we operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars however some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into us dollars 

in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks including the use of derivative instruments these strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses 

risks related to our taxes 

changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

corporate tax reform antibaseerosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been and will likely continue to be proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate 

after enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act most of our income is taxable in the us with a significant portion taxable under the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” regime beginning in fiscal year 2027 the deduction allowable under the gilti regime will decrease from 50 to 375 which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income the us also enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 “ira” in august 2022 which creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15 of consolidated gaap pretax income for corporations with average book income in excess of 1 billion the book minimum tax will first apply to our fiscal year 2024 and any increase in our effective tax rate or cash tax will depend on a number of factors including any offsets for foreign tax credits or general business credits or changes in book income following business combinations the ira also creates an excise tax of 1 of the value of any stock repurchased by us after december 31 2022 we could be subject to this new excise tax but the amount will vary depending on various factors including the amount and frequency of any stock repurchases applicability in certain business combination transactions and any permitted reductions or exceptions to the amount subject to the tax if i the us tax rate increases ii the deduction allowable under the gilti regime is further reduced or eliminated iii additional limitations are put on our ability to deduct interest expense or iv the requirement for research and development costs to be capitalized beginning in fiscal year 2023 remains in effect our provision for income taxes net income and cash flows would be adversely impacted 

in addition many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices the oecd is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax namely the “pillar one” and “pillar two” proposals some countries intend to implement laws based on pillar two proposals which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes net income and cash flows as a result of this heightened scrutiny prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies regulations or guidance enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

if the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect our corporate income taxes could significantly increase 

our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example absent our principal tax incentives from the singapore economic development board which is scheduled to expire in 2025 the corporate income tax rate that would apply to our singapore taxable income would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may in some instances be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled in addition we may be required or elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive our tax incentives could also be adversely impacted if the global minimum tax provisions pillar two are adopted in a country in which we have an existing tax incentive our tax incentives and tax holiday before taking into consideration us foreign tax credits decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately  1821 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by 431 for fiscal year 2022 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 

our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially adversely affect financial results 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which 

we are required to file tax returns although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 

our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

• reorganization or restructuring of our businesses tangible and intangible assets outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure 

• jurisdictional mix of our income and assets 

• changes in the allocation of income and expenses including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure acquisitions or tax law 

• changes in us and foreign tax laws and regulations changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxation of us income generated from foreign sources the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules 

• tax effects of increases in nondeductible employee compensation and 

• changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services the sale of products the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of comprehensive treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful result in adjustments for prior or future years the effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected 

in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy 

as of october 30 2022 the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was 41218 million this amount does not reflect any debt we expect to incur or assume in connection with the vmware merger 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities which we do not typically hedge against 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

• making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other purposes and 

• potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies while we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets could 

• adversely affect the trading price of or market for our debt securities 

• increase interest expense under our term facilities 

• increase the cost of and adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing debt and 

• adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt 

the instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business to plan for or react to changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed which could result in a default on our indebtedness 

risks related to owning our common stock 

at times our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

the trading price of our common stock has at times fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and others including 

• issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts 

• fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

• announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors 

• announcements of or expectations of additional debt or equity financing transactions 

• stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock 

• hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock and 

• unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business 

these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or currency fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future in addition we have been and in the future we may be subject to lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions including the vmware merger securities litigation against us including the lawsuits related to such acquisitions could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes these purposes include operational spending capital spending acquisitions repayment of debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments changes in cash flows tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program we are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time 

a substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall 

as of september 30 2022 we believe 10 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active institutional investors who held approximately 27 of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate these investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock in addition any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all

issuer purchases of equity securities 

during the fiscal quarter ended october 30 2022 we paid approximately 274 million in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards we withheld approximately 1 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share settlement at an average price of 50262 per share these shares may be deemed to be “issuer purchases” of shares 

in december 2021 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to december 31 2022 during fiscal year 2022 we repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for 7 billion under this stock repurchase program 

in may 2022 our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional 10 billion of our common stock from time to time through december 31 2023 

repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a variety of methods including open market or privately negotiated purchases the timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities acquisition opportunities and other factors we are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time

overview 

we are a global technology leader that designs develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions we develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog iiiv based products we have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms our portfolio of industryleading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize optimize and secure the most complex hybrid environments enabling scalability agility automation insights resiliency and security we also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking “fc san” products and related software in the form of modules switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products 

we have two reportable segments semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product lines and intellectual property “ip” licensing our infrastructure software segment includes our mainframe distributed and cyber security solutions and our fc san business 

our strategy is to combine bestofbreed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions with unmatched scale on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading business and government customers we seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of categoryleading businesses and technologies as well as investing extensively in research and development to ensure our products retain their technology leadership this strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results 

the demand for our products has been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factors including the following 

• gain or loss of significant customers 

• general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete 

• our distributors’ product inventory and end customer demand 

• the rate at which our present and future customers and endusers adopt our products and technologies in our target markets and the rate at which our customers products that include our technology are accepted in their markets 

• the shift to cloudbased information technology solutions and services such as hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers and 

• the timing rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders 

covid19 update 

the covid19 pandemic and the efforts to control it disrupted and reduced the efficiency of normal business activities in much of the world the pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures that created supply chain and market disruption impacting our workforce and operations and those of our customers contract manufacturers suppliers and logistics providers 

while the demand environment for our semiconductor products was consistent with our expectations for fiscal year 2022 with robust and increased profitability driven by the supply imbalance the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain including with respect to wafers and substrates although supply lead times have stabilized we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner to meet demand 

in response to the pandemic we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities we continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may modify our business practices and policies from time to time 

our ability to predict the impact of the pandemic on our business remains limited and its effects on our business are unlikely to be fully realized or reflected in our financial results until future periods 

fiscal year highlights 

highlights during fiscal year 2022 include the following 

• we generated 16736 million of cash from operations 

• we paid 7032 million in cash dividends 

• we repurchased 7000 million of common stock 

pending acquisition of vmware inc 

on may 26 2022 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “vmware merger agreement” to acquire all of the outstanding shares of vmware inc “vmware” in a cashandstock transaction the “vmware merger” that values vmware at approximately 61 billion based on the closing price of broadcom common stock on may 25 2022 we will also assume vmware’s closing date outstanding debt net of expected cash 

under the terms of the vmware merger agreement each share of vmware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the vmware merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive at the election of the holder of such share of vmware common stock either 14250 in cash without interest or 02520 shares of broadcom common stock the stockholder election will be subject to proration such that the total number of shares of vmware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of vmware common stock entitled to receive broadcom common stock will in each case be equal to 50 of the aggregate number of shares of vmware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the vmware merger 

we will assume all outstanding vmware restricted stock unit “rsu” awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees the assumed awards will be converted into rsu awards for shares of broadcom common stock all outstanding inthemoney vmware stock options and rsu awards held by nonemployee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of broadcom common stock in equal parts 

effective upon the effective time of the vmware merger one member of the vmware board of directors to be mutually agreed by us and vmware will be added to our board of directors 

in connection with the execution of the vmware merger agreement we entered into a commitment letter on may 26 2022 with certain financial institutions that committed to provide subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of 32 billion 

the vmware merger which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending october 29 2023 “fiscal year 2023” is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvement act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the european union and certain other jurisdictions on october 3 2022 we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock on november 4 2022 vmware stockholders adopted the vmware merger agreement we and vmware each have termination rights under the vmware merger agreement and under specified circumstances upon termination of the agreement we and vmware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of 15 billion 

net revenue 

a majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products as well as from modules switches and subsystems net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms 

our overall net revenue as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments have varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuations in end 

market demand including the effects of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part i item 1 business under “seasonality” of this annual report on form 10k 

distributors and original equipment manufacturers “oems” or their contract manufacturers typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales to serve customers around the world we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large oem customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries such as contract manufacturers many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development this has enabled us to build our extensive ip portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements including substantial systemlevel knowledge this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers we recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 

our software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex we believe our enterprisewide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth 

costs and expenses 

cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations which include stockbased compensation expense related occupancy computer services equipment costs manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustments inventory adjustments including writedowns for inventory obsolescence and acquisition costs which include direct transaction costs and acquisitionrelated costs 

although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 

cost of subscriptions and services cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses personnel costs include stockbased compensation expense 

total cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges 

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies including stockbased compensation expense these expenses also include project material costs thirdparty fees paid to consultants prototype development expense allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 

selling  general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel including stockbased compensation expense sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives advertising costs trade shows corporate marketing promotion travel related to our sales and marketing operations related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management finance human resources and other administrative personnel including stockbased compensation expense outside professional fees allocated facilities costs acquisitionrelated costs and other corporate expenses 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and inprocess research and development “iprd” which is initially capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset in connection with the acquisitions upon completion of each underlying project iprd assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges restructuring impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs alignment of our global manufacturing operations rationalizing product development program costs facility and lease abandonments fixed asset impairment iprd impairment and other exit costs including curtailment of service or supply agreements 

interest expense interest expense includes coupon interest commitment fees accretion of original issue discount amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments 

other income expense net other income expense net includes interest income gains or losses on investments foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 

provision for income taxes we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment our tax incentives from the singapore economic development board provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments these singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in november 2025 the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in 2028 

each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions if we cannot or elect not to comply with any such operating conditions specified we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled we may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements before taking into consideration the effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act and other indirect tax impacts the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately 1821 million and 1156 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies include revenue recognition valuation of goodwill and longlived assets and income taxes see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition we account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations each party’s rights can be identified payment terms can be identified the contract has commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services 

we recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates however because of the inherent nature of estimates there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results we also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue 100 of potential rebates at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances considers various macroeconomic industryspecific and companyspecific factors these factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends ii significant companyspecific actions including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of events and circumstances if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses and taxes as well as working capital and capital asset requirements these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows the market approach is based on weighting the financial multiples of comparable companies and applying a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash and debt 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including purchased iprd property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trends the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business to which the longlived assets relate we also consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the longlived assets stated on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect their estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances an adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the morelikelythannot threshold for recognition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes interest and penalties will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed a further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 

fiscal year presentation 

we operate on a 52 or 53week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to october 31 in a 52week year and the first sunday in november in a 53week year our fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 consisted of 52 weeks 

the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with gaap and expressed in us dollars 

results of operations 

fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented 



net revenue 

a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue sales of products to distributors accounted for 56 and 53 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively direct sales to wt microelectronics co ltd a distributor accounted for 20 and 18 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively we believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for approximately 35 of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 20 of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true of our wireless products as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of launches and seasonal variations in sales of mobile devices the covid19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties may cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and impact our results of operations 

although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in penang malaysia we disclose net revenue by country based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by our distributors oems contract manufacturers channel partners or software customers in each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 approximately 35 of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to china including hong kong however the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated are frequently located in countries other than china including hong kong as a result we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product to end customers located in china including hong kong 

the following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented 





net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to strong product demand primarily for networking server storage and broadband products as well as higher demand for our wireless content in mobile devices net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and fc san products 

gross margin 

gross margin was 22095 million or 67 of net revenue for fiscal year 2022 compared to 16844 million or 61 of net revenue for fiscal year 2021 the increase was primarily due to lower amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets mainly from our 2016 acquisition of broadcom corporation and to a lesser extent favorable margin within our semiconductor solutions segment 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 65 million or 1 in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense and engineering project costs partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense reflecting the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effects of forfeitures 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 35 million or 3 in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to higher variable employee compensation expense offset in part by lower stockbased compensation expense 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased 464 million or 23 in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets from our acquisition of ca inc 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges recognized in operating expenses decreased 91 million or 61 in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year  the decrease was primarily due to lower employee termination costs following the completion of key restructuring activities from acquisitions 

stockbased compensation expense 

total stockbased compensation expense was 1533 million and 1704 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the decrease primarily reflects the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effect of forfeitures 

the following table sets forth the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stockbased awards outstanding and expected to vest as of october 30 2022 which we expect to recognize over the remaining weightedaverage service period of 27 years 



during the first quarter of fiscal year ended november 3 2019 “fiscal year 2019” our compensation committee approved a broadbased program of multiyear equity grants of time and marketbased rsus the “multiyear equity awards” in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on march 15 of each year each multiyear equity award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made march 15 of each year beginning in fiscal year 2019 with successive fouryear vesting periods we recognize stockbased compensation expense related to the multiyear equity awards from the grant date through their respective vesting date ranging from 4 years to 7 years 

segment operating results 



operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased primarily due to higher net revenue from networking server storage broadband and wireless products as well as higher gross margin operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our mainframe solutions and fc san products 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charges acquisitionrelated costs and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses decreased 18 in fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense interest expense was 1737 million and 1885 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the decrease was primarily due to lower losses on extinguishment of debt we expect to incur additional interest expense in future periods as a result of indebtedness associated with the pending vmware merger 

other income expense net other income expense net includes interest income gains or losses on investments foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items other expense net was 54 million for fiscal year 2022 compared to other income net of 131 million for fiscal year 2021 the change was primarily due to changes in investment gains or losses 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was 939 million and 29 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations before income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 

our primary sources of liquidity as of october 30 2022 consisted of i 12416 million in cash and cash equivalents ii cash we expect to generate from operations and iii available capacity under our 75 billion unsecured revolving credit 

facility the “revolving facility” in addition we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time 

our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from i business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time including the pending vmware merger ii working capital requirements iii research and development and capital expenditure needs iv cash dividend payments if and when declared by our board of directors v interest and principal payments related to our 41218 million of outstanding indebtedness vi share repurchases and vii payment of income taxes our ability to fund these requirements will depend in part on our future cash flows which are determined by our future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control we expect capital expenditures to be higher in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022 our debt and liquidity needs will increase as a result of the pending vmware merger and we intend to fund the cash portion of the consideration with 32 billion in new fully committed debt financing 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operations and the revolving facility as well as the committed debt funding related to the pending vmware merger will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months for additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations indebtedness and lease obligations see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” note 10 “borrowings” and note 6 “leases” in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction or evaluation of potential transactions could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities including acquisitions or unanticipated capital expenditures our business and financial condition could suffer in such circumstances we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing however we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to service our senior unsecured notes and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above 

in addition we may at any time and from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders andor exchanges for equity or debt in openmarket purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such tenders exchanges or purchases if any will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine and will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

working capital 

working capital increased to 11452 million at october 30 2022 from 10305 million at october 31 2021 the increase was attributable to the following 

• accounts receivable increased to 2958 million at october 30 2022 from 2071 million at october 31 2021 primarily due to revenue linearity and less receivables sold through factoring arrangements 

• inventory increased to 1925 million at october 30 2022 from 1297 million at october 31 2021 primarily to support customer demand and due to higher material costs 

• cash and cash equivalents increased to 12416 million at october 30 2022 from 12163 million at october 31 2021 primarily due to 16736 million in net cash provided by operating activities and 1935 million in proceeds from longterm borrowings partially offset by 7032 million of dividend payments 7000 million of common stock repurchases 2361 million of debt payments and 1455 million of employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards 

• other current assets increased to 1205 million at october 30 2022 from 1055 million at october 31 2021 primarily due to an increase in prepaid taxes offset in part by a decrease in shortterm investments 

these increases in working capital were offset in part by the following 

• other current liabilities increased to 4412 million at october 30 2022 from 3839 million at october 31 2021 primarily due to increases in contract liabilities taxes payable and interest payable 

• current portion of longterm debt increased to 440 million at october 30 2022 from 290 million at october 31 2021 primarily due to certain debt instruments becoming due within the next twelve months offset in part by repayments 

• employee compensation and benefits increased to 1202 million at october 30 2022 from 1066 million at october 31 2021 primarily due to higher variable compensation based on current fiscal year performance 

capital returns 



in december 2021 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to december 31 2022 during fiscal year 2022 we repurchased and retired approximately 12 million shares of our common stock for 7 billion under this stock repurchase program in may 2022 our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional 10 billion of our common stock from time to time through december 31 2023 

repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be effected through a variety of methods including open market or privately negotiated purchases the timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities acquisition opportunities and other factors we are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock and the stock repurchase programs may be suspended or terminated at any time 

during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 we paid approximately 1455 million and 1299 million respectively in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards we withheld approximately 3 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share settlements during each of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash and other items and changes in assets and liabilities the 2972 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was due to 4759 million higher net income and certain noncash adjustments including deferred taxes and other noncash taxes offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation as well as a 1527 million decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures and sales and purchases of investments the 422 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a 238 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions and 169 million lower net proceeds from sales of investments 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of dividend payments stock repurchases proceeds and payments related to our longterm borrowings and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards the 6842 million increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily 

due to 7000 million in common stock repurchases a 820 million increase in dividend payments and a 156 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards offset in part by a 1165 million change in net borrowing activities

our software customers are in most major industries worldwide including banks insurance companies other financial services providers government agencies global it service providers telecommunication providers transportation companies manufacturers technology companies retailers educational organizations and health care institutions our customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex we remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core mainframecentric and symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers we believe our enterprisewide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth 

manufacturing operations 

we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable lowcost operating model accordingly we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing thirdparty foundry and assembly and test capabilities as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions the majority of our frontend wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” we use thirdparty contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations including advanced semiconductor engineering inc foxconn technology group amkor technology inc and siliconware precision industries co ltd we use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes such as our fbar filters for wireless communications and our verticalcavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasersbased on gaas and inp lasers for fiber optic communications while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard cmos by doing so we can protect our ip and accelerate time to market for our products the majority of our internal iiiv semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the us and singapore 

we also have a long history of operating in asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials we store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in malaysia and our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities 

manufacturing materials and suppliers 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis these purchases are generally on a purchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time and cost necessary for redesign or qualification to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we may use a number of techniques including redesigning products for alternative components making incremental or “lifetime” purchases or qualifying more than one source of supply our longterm relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans and to monitor our suppliers financial health some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique or highly specialized components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all 

competition 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market additionally our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors including quality technical performance price product features product system 

compatibility systemlevel design capability engineering expertise responsiveness to customers new product innovation product availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 

in the semiconductor market we compete with integrated device manufacturers fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems our primary competitors are amlogic inc analog devices inc advanced micro devices inc cisco systems inc cree inc globalfoundries hamamatsu photonics kk heidenhain corporation hisilicon technologies co ltd ichaus gmbh intel corp lumentum holdings inc macom technology solutions holdings inc maxlinear inc marvell technology inc mediatek inc nvidia corporation microchip technology incorporated mitsubishi electric corporation murata manufacturing co ltd nxp semiconductors nv on semiconductor corporation osram qorvo inc qualcomm inc realtek semiconductor corp renesas electronics corporation skyworks solutions inc st microelectronics nv sumitomo corporation synaptics incorporated tdkepc corporation toshiba corporation texas instruments inc and iivi incorporated we compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise fbar technology amplifier design module integration proprietary materials processes multiple storage protocols and mixedsignal design our broad product portfolio support of key industry standards reputation for quality products and our customer relationships 

in the infrastructure software market we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines and smaller niche players focused on specific markets our primary competitors are atlassian corporation plc bmc software inc beyondtrust corporation cisco systems inc crowdstrike holdings inc cyberark software ltd international business machines corporation micro focus international plc microsoft corporation new relic inc oracle corporation proofpoint inc rocket software inc sailpoint inc salesforcecom inc servicenow inc solarwinds inc splunk inc and zscaler inc we compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools breadth and synergy of offerings our platform and hardware independence our global reach and our deep customer relationships and industry experience 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade secrets and similar ip as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through security measures to protect our trade secrets we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 

as of october 31 2021 we had 19170 us and other patents and 511 us and other pending patent applications the expiration dates of our patents range from 2020 to 2039 with a small number of patents expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 

we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 

we and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of ip licensing and crosslicensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors a portion of our revenue comes from ip licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such ip we also license thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities products and manufacturing processes historically licenses of the thirdparty technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty ip infringement claims arising from our products claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us with respect to any ip rights claims against us or our customers or distributors we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation cease manufacture the infringing products pay damages expend resources to develop noninfringing technology seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or relinquish patents or other ip rights 

with respect to our infrastructure software the proprietary portions of our source code for our products are protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted works except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products rather onpremise customers typically access only the executable code for our products and saas customers access only the functionality of our saas offerings under certain contingent circumstances some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow 

arrangement that would enables them to obtain a limited right to access and use our source code if specific conditions are met 

employees 

our success depends on our continued ability to attract motivate and retain our workforce as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset competition for these and other talented employees is significant in many locations where we operate such as silicon valley and southeast asia 

we measure our employees’ engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and employee feedback our global voluntary attrition rate in fiscal year 2021 was approximately 7 below the technology industry benchmark aon 2021 salary increase and turnover study — second edition september 2021 

we also track the portion of our workforce in research and development roles as of october 31 2021 we had approximately 20000 employees worldwide with approximately 63 in research and development roles by geography approximately 54 of our employees are located in north america 35 in asia and 11 in europe the middle east and africa 

governmental regulation 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health safety and the environment these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air water and soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we are also subject to regulation by the us occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 

we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements including legislation enacted in the us european union and china among a growing number of jurisdictions which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead among other substances in electronic products which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging in addition our business is subject to various importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders and rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal trade commission “ftc” these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time we may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products these products have historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly with our wireless communications products we have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification

for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business see below 

risks related to our business 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has disrupted and will likely continue to disrupt normal business activity which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the global spread of covid19 and the efforts to control it have disrupted and reduced the efficiency of normal business activities in much of the world the pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders factory and office shutdowns and vaccine mandates these measures have impacted and will likely continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers contract manufacturers “cms” suppliers and logistics providers 

we have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices in addition our primary warehouse and a number of our key suppliers particularly assembly and test service providers are in malaysia while our malaysia warehouse has remained fully operational many of the facilities of our key suppliers and other service providers were shut down or operated at reduced capacity for extended periods this resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays which could recur in the event of any future closures of or periods of reduced operations at our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers any similar disruption at our fort collins colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our fbar products and adversely affect our wireless business in addition disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery times for materials and components to our facilities transfers of our products to our key suppliers and in some cases our ability to timely ship our products to customers as a result of these supply chain disruptions we have increased customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation we are also largely building semiconductor products to order as demand continues to outpace supply this has limited and may continue to limit our ability to fulfill orders and satisfy all of the demand for our products which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers 

in response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures we modified our workplace practices globally which has resulted in many of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time working remotely for extended periods may reduce our employees’ efficiency and productivity which may cause product development delays hamper new product innovation and have other unforeseen adverse effects on our business in addition if a significant number of our employees or employees and third parties performing key functions including our chief executive officer and members of our board of directors become ill our business may be further adversely impacted while we have implemented personal safety measures at all of our facilities where our employees are working onsite we may need to modify our business practices and policies in a manner that may adversely impact our business especially if the spread of covid19 including any variants worsen significantly and existing and new precautionary measures could negatively impact our operations in addition any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of covid19related claims changes to state workers’ compensation laws such as those in california may increase our potential liability for such claims 

while we continue to see robust demand in our semiconductor solutions segment and record profitability driven by the supply imbalance and have seen little impact to our software business from the covid19 pandemic the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control including the extent of actions to contain the virus including any variants availability and efficacy of the vaccines or other treatments public acceptance of the vaccines including boosters and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume 

the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on a small number of end customers oems their respective cms and certain distributors for a majority of our business revenue and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 sales to distributors accounted for 53 of our net revenue we believe aggregate sales through all channels to apple and our top five end customers accounted for approximately 20 and more than 35 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2021 respectively this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant customers 

the terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customers generally do not include commitments to purchase any specific quantities of products even in those instances where we have an arrangement under which a customer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us provided we meet our contractual obligations the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect as a result we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements moreover our top customers’ purchasing power has in some cases given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and should we fail to perform under these arrangements we could also be liable for significant monetary damages 

the loss of or any substantial reduction in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes cms such as thirdparty wafer foundries and module assembly and test capabilities our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with a particular cm 

we depend on our cms to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis we do not generally have longterm capacity commitments with our cms and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no minimum quantities further our cms may fail to timely develop new advanced manufacturing processes including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies or from time to time will cease to or will become unable to manufacture a component for us as lead times to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new cm is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraints on our ability to change cms in addition qualifying such cms is often expensive and they may not produce products as costeffectively as our current suppliers 

tsmc one of our cms manufactured approximately 89 of the wafers manufactured by our cms during fiscal year 2021 our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose or be required to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice in addition tsmc has and may in the future raise their prices to us 

if any of the foregoing circumstances occur we may be unable to meet our customer demand or to the same extent as our competitors fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities this has in the past damaged and may in the future damage our relationships with our customers this could also result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations payment of significant damages and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition results of operations and gross margin 

further any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services that we utilize including tsmc’s supply of wafers to us as a result of a natural disaster climate change water shortages political unrest military conflicts geopolitical turmoil trade tensions government orders medical epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationships and results of operations 

we purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing processes and those of our cms rely on many materials including silicon gaas and inp wafers copper lead frames precious and rare earth metals mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we purchase a significant portion of our materials components and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers some of which are single source suppliers as certain materials are highly specialized the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source during fiscal year 2021 we purchased approximately twothirds of our manufacturing materials from five materials providers we do not generally have longterm contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases capacity constraints inflation or other factors any of which could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry for example due to the covid19 pandemic we have experienced some supply constraints and increases in prices including with respect to wafers and substrates additionally the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the us and its trading partners particularly china these supply constraints have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our customer relationships further continued supply constraints for these or any other reasons could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties 

our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements including anticompetition and importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally and may continue to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be 

required to suspend sales to these customers which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations the us government may also add companies to its restricted entity list andor technologies to its list of prohibited exports to specific countries which have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our revenue for example huawei technologies co ltd one of our customers is subject to certain us export restrictions which has required us to suspend sales to huawei until we obtain licenses from the us department of commerce we may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary licenses to allow us to export products to them these restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on us companies by other governments especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with china will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our products and operations are also subject to regulation by us and nonus regulatory agencies such as the us federal trade commission “ftc” from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries such as the ongoing investigation by the korean fair trade commission into certain of our contracting and business practices which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anticompetition legislation regulation administrative rule making and enforcement activity involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel 

if any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments andor cease certain conduct andor modify our contracting or business practices which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties 

in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur for example if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt crossborder manufacturing relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to comply with these requirements we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution 

adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 

a general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners inflation or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and results of operations macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expenses and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of trade tensions between the us and china has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in chinese markets or compete effectively with chinese companies sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the us and its trading partners especially china and possible decoupling of the us and china economies could result in a global economic slowdown and longterm changes to global trade such events may also i cause our customers and consumers to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers and iv intensify pricing pressures any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand from time to time these factors together with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular the industry has experienced a significant upturn due to the supply imbalance resulting in record profitability and increases in average selling prices which may not be sustainable in the longer term 

conversely periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for enduser products high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable if we cannot offset industry or market downturns our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a majority of our products are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition as of october 31 2021 approximately 48 of our employees were located outside the us multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

• changes in political regulatory legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political or military coups or civil disturbances or political instability foreign and domestic 

• restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments data privacy regulations imposition of climate change regulations and trade protection measures including increasing protectionism importexport restrictions importexport duties and quotas trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs all of which have increased in recent years 

• difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support and transportation delays 

• potential inability to localize software products for a significant number of international markets 

• difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets 

• public health or safety concerns medical epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and other natural or manmade disasters 

• nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets and 

• changes in us and foreign tax laws 

a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business in addition the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may in some cases conflict with each other although our policies prohibit us our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices there can be no assurance that all of our employees distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anticorruption or other policies and procedures any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners including product inventory levels and product sellthrough 

we sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally sales to distributors accounted for 53 of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 and are subject to a number of risks including 

• fluctuations in demand based on our distributors’ product inventory levels and end customer demand in a given quarter 

• our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers 

• our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause 

• our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers and 

• our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these products 

in addition we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks 

we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products as a result our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical devices and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications in such event failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 

our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team 

our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management team and in particular the services of mr hock e tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel including cyber security experts are a significant asset competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand in addition current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers further limiting the pool of available talent further our employees may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little or no notice we believe equity awards provide a powerful longterm retention incentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees however the amendments to our 2012 stock incentive plan approved by our stockholders at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders significantly reduced the number of shares available for equity awards as a result we may need to change our current equity granting philosophy which could impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities 

any acquisitions we may undertake and their integration involve risks and uncertainties such as 

• unexpected delays challenges and related expenses and disruption of our business 

• diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities 

• incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense assuming liabilities some of which may be unexpected and ongoing or new lawsuits related to the transaction or otherwise potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements 

• the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business as well as implementing our own management information systems operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations 

• our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s products financial disclosures accounting practices legal tax and other contingencies compliance with local laws and regulations and interpretations thereof in the us and multiple international jurisdictions 

• additional acquisitionrelated debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow 

• dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders 

• difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees vendors and customers and 

• inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction 

in addition the current and the proposed changes to the us and foreign regulatory approval process and requirements in connection with an acquisition may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated to obtain not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions which may jeopardize delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction to us and could impede the execution of our business strategy 

from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investments any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us or at all disruption to other parts of our business potential loss of employees or customers or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions in addition dispositions may include the transfer of technology andor the licensing of certain ip rights to thirdparty purchasers which could limit our ability to utilize such ip rights or assert these rights against such thirdparty purchasers or other third parties 

we may be involved in legal proceedings including ip securities litigation and employeerelated claims which could among other things divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip rights 

we are often involved in legal proceedings including cases involving our ip rights and those of others commercial matters acquisitionrelated suits securities class action suits employeerelated claims and other actions litigation or settlement of such actions regardless of their merit can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel 

the industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including actions by patentholding companies that do not make or sell products from time to time third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their ip rights to technologies that are important to our business for example in august 2020 judgment was entered against broadcom and apple for infringement of certain patents pursuant to which california institute of technology was awarded past damages of 2702 million from broadcom and 8378 million from apple for which apple is seeking indemnification from broadcom although we are appealing this judgment there are no assurances that we will be successful 

many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements andor the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for thirdparty ip infringement claims including costs to defend those claims and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings however our cms and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such thirdparty claims claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could be required to 

• cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing products processes or technology andor make changes to our processes or products 

• pay substantial damages for past present and future use of the infringing technology including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found 

• expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 

• license technology from the thirdparty claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

• enter into crosslicenses with our competitors which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories 

• pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with noninfringing technology or 

• relinquish ip rights associated with one or more of our patent claims 

any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with such litigation these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals as well as stockholder derivative suits civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed 

our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control in addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section these factors include among others 

• the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in enduser demand for our customers’ the products 

• fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers 

• the shift to cloudbased it solutions and services such as hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers 

• the timing of new software contracts and renewals as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any prepaid amounts under the contract 

• our ability to timely develop introduce and market new products and technologies 

• the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue and other nonproduct revenue 

• new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors 

• seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets 

• timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies and 

• timing of any regulatory changes particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs and tax reform 

the foregoing factors are often difficult to predict and these as well as other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results in addition a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time 

failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

we make significant decisions including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept production schedules levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements which may not be accurate 

during the covid19 pandemic we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges more typically however to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts which are not binding as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence because certain of our sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income 

conversely customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice if we are unable to meet such increases in demand this could damage our customer relationships reduce revenue growth and margins subject us to additional liabilities harm our reputation and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities 

winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue 

our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes 

winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer a delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time may strain our resources and those of our cms in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses further often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products andor the manufacturing line for those products the qualification process can take significant time and resources delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue finally customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 

competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements often aggressive pricing practices and in some cases new delivery methods we expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets 

some of our competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition a larger installed customer base larger technical staffs more established relationships with vendors or suppliers or greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development technical and marketing resources than us we also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry open source authors who provide software and ip for free competitors who offer their products through tryandbuy or freemium models and customers who develop competing products 

in addition the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape we expect this trend to continue which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets a larger customer base a more comprehensive ip portfolio or better patent protection than us 

the actions of our competitors in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular could have a substantial adverse impact on us further competitors may leverage their superior market position as well as ip or other proprietary information including interface interoperability or technical information in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities research and development facilities warehouses or other significant operations or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes our fort collins and breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the fbar components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphidebased wafers used in our fibre optics products respectively many of our facilities and those of our cms and suppliers are located in california and the pacific rim region which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the czech republic india israel singapore and the us with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas and our primary warehouse is in malaysia 

a prolonged disruption at or shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses especially our colorado singapore malaysia and pennsylvania facilities or those of our cms or suppliers due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness including covid19 or for any other reason would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose us to claims by our customers result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share damage our customer relationships and be subject to 

litigation and additional liabilities all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand from time to time this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities which often involves substantial cost and other risks such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation forgo sales or lose customers as a result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed all of which could adversely affect our results of operations similarly reduced product yields due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers all of which could cause us to forgo sales incur liabilities or lose customers and harm our results of operations 

in addition current and future government restrictions imposed as a result of the covid19 pandemic that limit our manufacturing capabilities could severely impact our ability to manufacture our proprietary products adversely affecting our wireless business 

any failure of our it systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide necessary services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business depends on various it systems and outsourced it services we rely on thirdparty vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services and to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems services provided by these third parties include services related to financial reporting product orders and shipping human resources benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform we may be unable to collect any damages 

any failure of these internal or thirdparty systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our product mix price erosion acquisitions we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity prices 

our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and nonproduct revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternatives more complex engineering requirements lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors and other factors have in the past and may in the future lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin conversely periods of robust demand that create a supply imbalance as we have seen recently can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longerterm 

in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin furthermore we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices some of which are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 

our gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and by expenses related to such acquisitions 

we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants we spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights including the unauthorized 

use of our products usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect the ip rights that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that 

• our ip rights will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged or in the case of thirdparty ip rights licensed to us be licensed to others 

• our ip rights will provide competitive advantages to us 

• rights previously granted by third parties to ip licensed or assigned to us including portfolio crosslicenses will not hamper our ability to assert our ip rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes 

• any of our pending or future patent trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 

• our ip rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection may be weak or 

• we have sufficient ip rights to protect our products or our business 

effective ip protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the us and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions in addition when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 

we also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip rights particularly exclusive licenses may limit our ability to assert those ip rights against third parties including the licensee of those rights in addition we may acquire companies with ip that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties these licensing obligations may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip rights from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights including in some cases against our customers and suppliers claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us conversely third parties have and may in the future pursue ip litigation against us including as a result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments which could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 

if our software products do not remain compatible with everchanging operating environments platforms or thirdparty products demand for our products and services could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business 

we may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities w e must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments 

further our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties if we lose access to thirdparty code and specifications for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software providers and hardware manufacturers including some of our largest vendors adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems applications or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business 

many of our existing customers have multiyear enterprise software license agreements some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope on terms that are commercially attractive to us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense 

some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive the loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products 

certain software we use is from open source code sources which under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

some of our products contain software from open source code sources the use of which may subject us to certain conditions including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available further although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements it is common for such software to be available “asis” with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions such use under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters for example it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 

highly complex products such as those we offer may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions software documentation or enhancements are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development if any of our products or thirdparty components used in our products contain defects or bugs or have reliability quality or compatibility problems we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall repair or replacement costs significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of thirdparty software applications and databases as a result if there is systemwide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s system it can be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to resolve these problems we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected product or products these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others for example if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s endproduct delivery we may be required under the terms of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays as a result our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements short product cycles and evolving industry standards and new delivery methods in addition semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our products may be reduced increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use and store collectively “process” a high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business this creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business depending on the type of personal information the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments privacy legislation and other data protection regulations enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment sectoral legislation certification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers such as those is the financial services or public sector are likely to further exacerbate this trend the cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security business process business record or data localization requirements concerns about government interference sovereignty expanding privacy cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services particularly in cloud computing artificial intelligence and our own data management practices the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation substantial fines and damages and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws which could increase our costs restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of international laws and regulations relating to the use disposal cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could among other things require us to modify our manufacturing processes restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronic products sold in various countries including the us china and japan and in the european union increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to reengineer our products such reengineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may also experience claims from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims 

social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer and investor demands may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors 

there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions 

an increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies practices and metrics in addition various jurisdictions are developing climate changebased laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these legal and regulatory requirements as well as investor expectations on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or cms to comply with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

in addition as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

the average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit 

the semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications as a result the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by among other things pricing pressures from our customers in the past we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors in addition some of our customer agreements provide for volumebased pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes reducing manufacturing costs or developing new and higher valueadded products on a timely basis 

a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our security systems are designed to protect and secure our facilities and our customers’ suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information as well as our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on a number of thirdparty cloudbased and other service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to among other things human resources electronic communication services and certain finance functions and we are out of necessity dependent on the security systems of these providers in addition all software including the security technologies produced by us have had occasionally in the past and may have in the future vulnerabilities that if left unmanaged could reduce the overall level of security 

accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access of our facilities our information systems or the systems of our service providers or the existence of computer viruses or malware such as ransomware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss business disruption and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees we have from time to time been subject to or there have been attempts of unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own it networks as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially while we have taken steps to secure our networks and systems we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyberattack or information security incident when our workforce works remotely 

certain aspects of our software products are intended to manage and secure it infrastructures and environments and as a result we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks open source code or other thirdparty software used in these products could also be targeted additionally we use thirdparty data centers which may also be subject to hacking or accidental incidents although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers cyber security attacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources additionally efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers a successful cyber security attack involving our products and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness and adversely affect our reputation relationship with our customers and our financial results 

any theft accidental loss or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other things unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secrets and 

other competitive information difficulty in marketing our products allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations such as the general data protection regulation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition interruptions in our operations and services or disruptions to the functionality provided by our software could adversely impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses 

we operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars however some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into us dollars 

in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks including the use of derivative instruments these strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses 

risks related to our taxes 

changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

corporate tax reform antibaseerosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been and will likely continue to be proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate 

after enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax reform act” most of our income is taxable in the us with a significant portion taxable under the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” regime beginning in fiscal year 2027 the deduction allowable under the gilti regime will decrease from 50 to 375 which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income if the us tax rate increases or the deduction allowable under the gilti regime is further reduced or eliminated or additional limitations are put on our ability to deduct interest expense our provision for income taxes net income and cash flows would be adversely impacted 

in addition many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices the oecd is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax namely the “pillar one” and “pillar two” proposals as a result of this heightened scrutiny prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change further many jurisdictions have passed and may pass additional legislation intended to alleviate the economic burdens of covid19 and to fund economic recovery and growth including various temporary tax incentives or relief and restricted tax measures which could result in future tax increases we cannot predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our tax liabilities and are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new legislation to our financial statements 

any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies regulations or guidance enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

if the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect our corporate income taxes could significantly increase 

our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example absent our principal tax incentives from the singapore economic development board which is scheduled to expire in 2025 the corporate income tax rate that would apply to our singapore taxable income would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may in some instances be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled in addition we may be required or elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive our tax incentives and tax holiday before taking into consideration us foreign tax credits decreased the provision for income taxes by approximately  1156 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by 269 for fiscal year 2021 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 

our income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially adversely affect financial results 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 

our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

• reorganization or restructuring of our businesses tangible and intangible assets outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure 

• jurisdictional mix of our income and assets 

• changes in the allocation of income and expenses including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure acquisitions or tax law 

• changes in us and foreign tax laws and regulations changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxation of us income generated from foreign sources the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules 

• tax effects of increases in nondeductible employee compensation and 

• changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services the sale of products the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of comprehensive treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful result in adjustments for prior or future years the effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected 

in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy 

as of october 31 2021 the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes was 41499 million we expect to maintain significant levels of indebtedness going forward 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities which we do not typically hedge against 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

• making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other purposes and 

• potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies while we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets could 

• adversely affect the trading price of or market for our debt securities 

• increase interest expense under our term facilities 

• increase the cost of and adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing debt and 

• adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt 

the instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business to plan for or react to changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed which could result in a default on our indebtedness 

risks related to owning our common stock 

at times our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

the trading price of our common stock has at times fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and others including 

• issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts 

• fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

• announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors 

• announcements of or expectations of additional debt or equity financing transactions 

• stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock 

• issuance and subsequent sale of common stock upon conversion of our 800 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a “mandatory convertible preferred stock” 

• hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our mandatory convertible preferred stock or common stock and 

• unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business 

these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or currency fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future we are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions securities litigation against us including the lawsuits related to such transactions could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes these purposes include operational spending capital spending acquisitions repayment of debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments changes in cash flows tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program we are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time 

a substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall 

as of september 30 2021 we believe 10 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active institutional investors who held approximately 31 of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate with capital world investors being our largest stockholder with approximately 9 of our outstanding shares of common stock these investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock in addition any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries in addition any payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to and conditioned upon our payment of quarterly dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all

overview 

we are a global technology leader that designs develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions we develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog iiiv based products we have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms our portfolio of industryleading infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize optimize and secure the most complex hybrid environments enabling scalability agility automation insights resiliency and security we also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking “fc san” products and related software in the form of modules switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products 

we have two reportable segments semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software as a result of a change in our organizational structure during fiscal year 2020 our semiconductor solutions segment includes all of our product lines and intellectual property “ip” licensing our infrastructure software segment includes our mainframe distributed and cyber security solutions and our fc san business during fiscal year 2020 we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling general and administrative expenses to more closely align these costs with the segment benefiting from the shared expenses 

our strategy is to combine bestofbreed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions with unmatched scale on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading business and government customers we seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of categoryleading businesses and technologies as well as investing extensively in research and development to ensure our products retain their technology leadership this strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results 

the demand for our products has been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factors including the following 

• gain or loss of significant customers 

• general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete 

• our distributors’ product inventory and end customer demand 

• the rate at which our present and future customers and endusers adopt our products and technologies in our target markets and the rate at which our customers products that include our technology are accepted in their markets 

• the shift to cloudbased information technology solutions and services such as hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers and 

• the timing rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders 

covid19 update 

in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the various resulting government directives we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities we modified our workplace practices globally which resulted in some of our employees working remotely for an extended period of time and some of whom are still working remotely while we have implemented personal safety measures at all of our facilities where 

our employees are working on site we may need to modify our business practices and policies we continue to monitor the implications of the covid19 pandemic on our business as well as our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

the demand environment for our semiconductor products was consistent with our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 with continued demand for products and infrastructure as customers invest in technologies to support remote or hybrid telework and learning arising from covid19 as well as the transition to office reopenings while we continue to see robust demand in this area and record profitability driven by the supply imbalance the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain due to the pandemic including with respect to wafers and substrates while supply lead times have stabilized we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner to meet increased demand to date the impact of covid19 on the demand environment for our software products has been limited 

we have also taken various actions to derisk our business in light of the ongoing uncertainty and strengthen our balance sheet including closely managing working capital and our debt instruments 

overall in light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic our ability to predict the impact of covid19 on our business in future periods remains limited the effects of the pandemic on our business are unlikely to be fully realized or reflected in our financial results until future periods 

fiscal year highlights 

highlights during fiscal year 2021 include the following 

• we generated 13764 million of cash from operations 

• we paid 6212 million in cash dividends 

acquisitions and divestitures 

the discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 

acquisition of symantec corporation enterprise security business 

on november 4 2019 we purchased and assumed certain assets and certain liabilities respectively of the symantec corporation enterprise security business the “symantec business” for 107 billion in cash we financed this acquisition with the net proceeds from the borrowings under the november 2019 term loans as defined in note 10 “borrowings” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

acquisition of ca inc 

on november 5 2018 we acquired ca inc “ca” for 188 billion in aggregate cash purchase consideration and assumed 225 billion of outstanding unsecured bonds we financed the acquisition of ca with 18 billion of term loans as well as cash on hand of the combined companies we also assumed all eligible unvested ca equity awards in the transaction on december 31 2018 we sold veracode inc a subsidiary of ca and provider of application security testing solutions to thoma bravo llc for cash consideration of 950 million before working capital adjustments 

net revenue 

a majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products as well as from modules switches and subsystems net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms 

our overall net revenue as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments have varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuations in endmarket demand including the effects of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part i item 1 business under “seasonality” of this annual report on form 10k 

original equipment manufacturers “oems” or their contract manufacturers and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales to serve customers around the world we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large oem customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries such as contract 

manufacturers many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development this has enabled us to build our extensive ip portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements including substantial systemlevel knowledge this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers we recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 

our software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex we believe our enterprisewide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth 

costs and expenses 

cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations which include stockbased compensation expense related occupancy computer services equipment costs manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustments inventory adjustments including writedowns for inventory obsolescence and acquisition costs which include direct transaction costs and acquisitionrelated costs 

although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 

cost of subscriptions and services cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses personnel costs include stockbased compensation expense 

total cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges 

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies including stockbased compensation expense these expenses also include project material costs thirdparty fees paid to consultants prototype development expense allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 

selling  general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel including stockbased compensation expense sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives advertising costs trade shows corporate marketing promotion travel related to our sales and marketing operations related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management finance human resources and other administrative personnel including stockbased compensation expense outside professional fees allocated facilities costs acquisitionrelated costs and other corporate expenses 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and inprocess research and development “iprd” which is initially capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset in connection with the acquisitions upon completion of each underlying project iprd assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges restructuring impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs alignment of our global manufacturing operations rationalizing product development program costs facility and lease abandonments fixed asset impairment iprd impairment and other exit costs including curtailment of service or supply agreements 

interest expense interest expense includes coupon interest commitment fees accretion of original issue discount amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments 

other income net other income net includes interest income gains or losses on investments foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 

provision for benefit from income taxes we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment our tax incentives from the singapore economic development board provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and 

legislative developments these singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in november 2025 the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 

each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions if we cannot or elect not to comply with any such operating conditions specified we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled we may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements before taking into consideration the effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act and other indirect tax impacts the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately 1156 million for fiscal year 2021 and increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately 833 million for fiscal year 2020 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies include revenue recognition business combinations valuation of goodwill and longlived assets inventory valuation income taxes retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions stockbased compensation and employee bonus programs see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition we account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations each party’s rights can be identified payment terms can be identified the contract has commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services 

we recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates however because of the inherent nature of estimates there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results we also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue 100 of potential rebates at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 

our contracts may contain more than one of our products and services each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation when available we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies technology lifecycles and market conditions 

we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights our estimate of the value of the customer’s option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised 

certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit we estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed restructuring liabilities preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on histor ical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies revenue growth rate customer rampup period technology obsolescence rates expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances considers various macroeconomic industryspecific and companyspecific factors these factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends ii significant companyspecific actions including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of events and circumstances if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses and taxes as well as working capital and capital asset requirements these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows the market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash and debt 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including purchased iprd property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trends the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business that the longlived asset relates to we also consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the longlived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheets 

to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand additionally our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 

income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances an adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes interest and penalties will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed a further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan obligations represent liabilities that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to us based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap one assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated plan obligations other assumptions include the expected longterm return on plan assets expected future salary increases the health care cost trend rate expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

for our us and nonus plans we use october 31 the month end closest to our fiscal year end as the annual discount rate measurement date to determine the present value of future benefit payments  the us discount rates are based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields the discount rate for nonus plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense 

the us expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fullymatched liabilitydriven investment strategy 

actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experiences we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating the us pension and postretirement benefit obligations each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated 36 million impact on the benefit obligations as of the fiscal year 2021 measurement date each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption or expected rate of return assumption would not have a material impact on annual net retirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ending october 30 2022 “fiscal year 2022” 

stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense consists of expense for restricted stock units “rsus” and stock options granted to employees and nonemployees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with broadcom employee stock purchase plan “espp” we recognize compensation expense for timebased stock options and espp rights based on the estimated grantdate fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the blackscholes valuation model 

certain equity awards include both timebased and marketbased conditions and are accounted for as marketbased awards the fair value of these marketbased awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model 

employee bonus programs our employee bonus programs which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics at the end of each fiscal quarter we monitor and accrue for an estimated variable proportional compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics the actual achievement of target and metrics at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter 

fiscal year presentation 

we operate on a 52 or 53week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to october 31 in a 52week year and the first sunday in november in a 53week year our fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 consisted of 52 weeks 

the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with gaap and expressed in us dollars 

results of operations 

fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented 



net revenue 

a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue sales of products to distributors accounted for 53 and 42 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively direct sales to wt microelectronics co ltd a distributor accounted for 18 and 13 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively we believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 35 and 30 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 20 and 15 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true of our wireless products as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of launches and seasonal variations in sales of mobile handsets the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related uncertainties and supply imbalance have caused and may continue to cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and impact our results of operations as discussed above additionally export restrictions on one of our larger customers have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our revenue 

although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in penang malaysia we disclose net revenue by country based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by our distributors oems contract manufacturers channel partners or software customers in each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 approximately 35 of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to china including hong kong however the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated are frequently located in countries other than china including hong kong as a result we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product to end customers located in china including hong kong 

the following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented 





net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our wireless products as well as the delayed production ramp of a new mobile handset by a major customer in the prior fiscal year which resulted in lower shipments in fiscal year 2020 net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment also increased due to higher demand for our networking and wireless connectivity products net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our fc san products mainframe and cyber security solutions 

gross margin 

gross margin was 16844 million or 61 of net revenue for fiscal year 2021 compared to 13516 million or 57 of net revenue for fiscal year 2020 the increase was primarily due to lower amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and favorable margin within our semiconductor solutions segment due to increased demand 

research and development expense 

research and development expense decreased 114 million or 2 in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower stockbased compensation expense reflecting the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effects of forfeitures partially offset by higher variable employee compensation expense 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense decreased 588 million or 30 in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to higher acquisitionrelated costs incurred in the prior fiscal year as a result of our acquisition of the symantec business the decrease was also due to lower compensation expense reflecting the full benefit of the completed symantec business integration as well as our strategic workforce alignment in addition fiscal year 2020 included nonrecurring litigation settlements 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased 425 million or 18 in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets from our acquisition of ca 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges recognized in operating expenses decreased 50 million or 25 in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year  the decrease was primarily due to higher employee termination costs in the prior fiscal year from cost reduction activities related to our acquisition of the symantec business 

stockbased compensation expense 

total stockbased compensation expense was 1704 million and 1976 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease primarily reflects the full vesting of certain equity awards and the effect of forfeitures 

the following table sets forth the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stockbased awards outstanding and expected to vest as of october 31 2021 which we expect to recognize over the remaining weightedaverage service period of 29 years 



during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 our compensation committee approved a broadbased program of multiyear equity grants of time and marketbased rsus the “multiyear equity awards” in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically granted on march 15 of each year each multiyear equity award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made march 15 of each year beginning in fiscal year 2019 with successive fouryear vesting periods we recognize stockbased compensation expense related to the multiyear equity awards from the grant date through their respective vesting date ranging from 4 years to 7 years 

segment operating results 



operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our wireless products as well as the delayed production ramp of a new mobile handset by a major customer in the prior fiscal year which resulted in lower shipments in fiscal year 2020 operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment also increased due to higher demand for our networking and wireless connectivity products as well as higher gross margin operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to higher demand for our fc san products and mainframe solutions 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charges acquisitionrelated costs and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses decreased 17 in fiscal year 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets acquisitionrelated costs and stockbased compensation expense 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense interest expense was 1885 million and 1777 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase was primarily due to higher losses on extinguishment of debt as a result of our fiscal year 2021 debt transactions 

other income net other income net which includes interest income gains or losses on investments foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items was 131 million and 206 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease was primarily due to a 116 million nonrecurring gain from the lapse of a tax indemnification arrangement included in the prior fiscal year offset in part by an increase in gains on investments in fiscal year 2021 

provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for income taxes of 29 million in fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to income from continuing operations offset in part by excess tax benefits from stockbased awards a benefit from foreign derived intangible income and the recognition of gross unrecognized tax benefits as a result of lapses of statutes of limitations and audit settlements 

the benefit from income taxes of 518 million in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and expense the recognition of gross uncertain tax benefits as a result of lapses of statutes of limitations the remeasurement of certain foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities and excess tax benefit from stockbased awards 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 

our primary sources of liquidity as of october 31 2021 consisted of i 12163 million in cash and cash equivalents ii cash we expect to generate from operations and iii available capacity under our 75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” in addition we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time 

our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from i business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time ii working capital requirements iii research and development and capital expenditure needs iv cash dividend payments if and when declared by our board of directors v interest and principal payments related to our outstanding indebtedness vi share repurchases and vii payment of income taxes our ability to fund these requirements will depend in part on our future cash flows which are determined by our future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operations and the revolving facility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months we expect a slight increase in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 for additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations indebtedness and lease obligations see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” note 10 “borrowings” and note 6 “leases” in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction or evaluation of potential transactions could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities including acquisitions or unanticipated capital expenditures our business and financial condition could suffer in such circumstances we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing however we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to service our senior unsecured notes and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above 

in addition we may at any time and from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders andor exchanges for equity or debt in openmarket purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such tenders exchanges or purchases if any will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine and will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

working capital 

working capital increased to 10305 million at october 31 2021 from 5524 million at november 1 2020 the increase was attributable to the following 

• cash and cash equivalents increased to 12163 million at october 31 2021 from 7618 million at november 1 2020 primarily due to 13764 million in net cash provided by operating activities and 9904 million in proceeds from longterm borrowings partially offset by 11495 million of payments on debt obligations 6212 million of dividend payments and 1299 million in payments of employee withholding taxes related to net share settled equity awards see the “cash flows” section below for further details 

• current portion of longterm debt decreased to 290 million at october 31 2021 from 827 million at november 1 2020 primarily as a result of our fiscal year 2021 debt transactions 

• inventory increased to 1297 million at october 31 2021 from 1003 million at november 1 2020 primarily due to the timing of customer product ramps 

these increases in working capital were offset in part by the following 

• accounts payable increased to 1086 million at october 31 2021 from 836 million at november 1 2020 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments 

• accounts receivable decreased to 2071 million at october 31 2021 from 2297 million at november 1 2020 primarily due to revenue linearity and additional receivables sold through factoring arrangements 

• employee compensation and benefits increased to 1066 million at october 31 2021 from 877 million at november 1 2020 primarily due to higher variable compensation based on current fiscal year performance 

capital returns 



during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we paid approximately 1299 million and 765 million respectively in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards we withheld approximately 3 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share settlements during each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

in december 2021 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 10 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to december 31 2022 repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be effected through a variety of methods including open market or privately negotiated purchases the timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on the stock price business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements alternative investment opportunities acquisition opportunities and other factors we are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash and other items and changes in assets and liabilities the 1703 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was due to 3776 million higher net income offset by a 1220 million decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities as well as a 853 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets stockbased compensation and other adjustments 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures and investments and proceeds from sales of businesses and assets the 10864 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to a 10864 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions partially offset by 173 million less in proceeds received from sales of businesses 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds and payments related to our longterm borrowings dividend and distribution payments stock repurchases and the issuances of stock the 10585 million decrease in cash related to financing activities for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a 9294 million decrease in net proceeds from borrowings as a result of debt repayments and a 678 million increase in dividend payments

manufacturing operations 

we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable lowcost operating model accordingly we outsource a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing thirdparty foundry and assembly and test capabilities as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions the majority of our frontend wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” we use thirdparty contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations including advanced semiconductor engineering inc foxconn technology group amkor technology inc and siliconware precision industries co ltd we use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes to protect our ip and to accelerate time to market for our products while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard cmos examples of internally fabricated semiconductors include our fbar filters for wireless communications and our verticalcavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasersbased on gaas and inp lasers for fiber optic communications the majority of our internal iiiv semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the us and singapore many of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular foundry either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer and in some instances we may only qualify one contract manufacturer to manufacture certain of our products 

we also have a long history of operating in asia where approximately 35 of our employees are located and where we manufacture and source the majority of our products and materials we store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in malaysia and our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing 

manufacturing materials and suppliers 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis these supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for redesign or qualification our longterm relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans and to monitor our suppliers financial health some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique or highly specialized components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we may use a number of techniques including in some cases qualifying more than one source of supply redesigning products for alternative components and incremental or in some cases lifetime purchases of affected parts for supply buffer 

competition 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market additionally our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors including quality technical performance price product features product system compatibility systemlevel design capability engineering expertise responsiveness to customers new product innovation product availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 

in the semiconductor market we compete with integrated device manufacturers fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems our primary competitors are analog devices inc cisco systems inc cree inc finisar corp globalfoundries hamamatsu photonics kk heidenhain corporation hisilicon technologies co ltd intel corp lumentum operations llc macom technology solutions holdings inc marvell technology group ltd mediatek inc mellanox technologies inc microsemi corp mitsubishi electric corporation murata manufacturing co ltd nxp semiconductors nv qorvo inc qualcomm inc quantenna communications inc acquired by on semiconductor corporation st microelectronics nv renesas electronics corporation skyworks solutions inc sumitomo corporation tdkepc corporation toshiba corporation and texas instruments inc we compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise fbar technology amplifier design module integration proprietary materials processes multiple storage protocols and mixedsignal design our broad product portfolio support of key industry standards reputation for quality products and our customer relationships

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade secrets and similar ip as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through security measures to protect our trade secrets we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 

as of november 1 2020 we had 22774 us and other patents and 1018 us and other pending patent applications the expiration dates of our patents range from 2020 to 2039 with a small number of patents expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 

we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 

we and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of ip licensing and crosslicensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors a portion of our revenue comes from ip licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such ip we also license thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities products and manufacturing processes historically licenses of the thirdparty technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty ip infringement claims arising from our products claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us with respect to any ip rights claims against us or our customers or distributors we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation cease manufacture the infringing products pay damages expend resources to develop noninfringing technology seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or relinquish patents or other ip rights 

with respect to our infrastructure software the source code for our products is protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted work except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products rather onpremise customers typically access only the executable code for our products and saas customers access only the functionality of our saas offerings under certain contingent circumstances some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow arrangement that enables them to obtain a limited right to access our source code 

employees 

our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand we track and report internally on key talent metrics including the portion of our workforce in research and development and the voluntary attrition rate during fiscal year 2020 our voluntary attrition rate was 7 below the technology industry benchmark aon 2020 salary increase and turnover study — second edition september 2020 

as of november 1 2020 we had approximately 21000 employees worldwide with approximately 63 of them in research and development by geography approximately 53 of our employees are located in north america 35 in asia and 12 in europe the middle east and africa and a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located in czech republic india israel singapore and the us 

governmental regulation 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health safety and the environment these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air water and soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we are also subject to regulation by the us occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 

we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements including legislation enacted in the us european union and china among a growing number of jurisdictions which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging in addition our business is subject to various importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders and rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal trade commission “ftc” these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current us administration especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with china we may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result

our semiconductor sales are generally made pursuant to shortterm purchase orders these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be rescheduled cancelled or modified on relatively short notice without substantial penalty in addition our software contracting model for the majority of our customers which are for enterprisewide licenses provide for termination thereof by our customers at any time for any reason as a result we recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over time therefore although we may have a large backlog from time to time we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products these products have historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly with our wireless communications products we have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification

for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business see below 

risks related to our business 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has and will likely continue to negatively impact the global economy and disrupt normal business activity which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the global spread of covid19 and the efforts to control it have slowed global economic activity and disrupted and reduced the efficiency of normal business activities in much of the world the pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and factory and office shutdowns these measures have impacted and will likely continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers contract manufacturers “cms” suppliers and logistics providers particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness 

we have been and expect to continue experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation including procuring necessary components and inputs such as wafers and substrates in a timely fashion in addition our primary warehouse and a number of our key suppliers particularly assembly and test service providers are in malaysia while our malaysia warehouse has remained fully operational many of the facilities of our key suppliers and other service providers were shut down or operated at reduced capacity for extended periods this resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays which could recur in the event of any future closures of or periods of reduced operations at our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers any similar disruption at our fort collins colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our fbar products and adversely affect our wireless business in addition disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery times for materials and components to our facilities transfers of our products to our key suppliers and in some cases our ability to timely ship our products to customers as a result of these supply chain disruptions we have increased customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation we are also largely building semiconductor products to order instead of based on customer forecasts in light of the ongoing uncertainty this may limit our ability to fulfill orders and we may be unable to satisfy all of the demand for our products which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers 

in response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures we modified our workplace practices globally which has resulted in many of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time while we have implemented a phasedin return of employees to many of our facilities if the spread of covid19 worsens significantly we may need to further limit onsite operations or otherwise modify our business practices in a manner that may adversely impact our business working remotely for extended periods may reduce our employees’ efficiency and productivity which may cause product development delays hamper new product innovation and have other unforeseen adverse effects on our business in addition if a significant number of our employees or employees and third parties performing key functions including our ceo and members of our board of directors become ill our business may be further adversely impacted while we have implemented personal safety measures at all of our facilities where our employees are working onsite any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in a significant number of covid19related claims changes to state workers’ compensation laws as have recently occurred in california may increase our potential liability for such claims 

in the longerterm the covid19 pandemic is likely to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries and could result in a global economic downturn and a recession this would likely adversely affect demand for our products and those of our customers particularly consumer products such as smartphones which may in turn negatively impact our results of operations however there is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such downturn or recession while we continue to see robust demand in our semiconductor segment and have seen little impact to our software business from the covid19 pandemic the environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term the degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations will depend on future developments beyond our control including the severity of the pandemic the extent of actions to contain the virus availability of a vaccine or other treatment how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic 

the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on a small number of end customers oems their respective cms and certain distributors for a majority of our business revenue and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 sales to distributors accounted for 42 of our net revenue we believe aggregate sales through all channels to apple and our top five end customers accounted for approximately 15 and more than 30 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2020 respectively this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant customers 

the terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customers generally do not include commitments by those customers to purchase any specific quantities of products from us even in those instances where we enter into an arrangement under which a customer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us provided that we are able to meet specified development supply and quality commitments the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect as a result we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements moreover our top customers’ purchasing power has in some cases given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and should we fail to perform under these arrangements we could also be liable for significant monetary damages 

the loss of or any substantial reduction in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes cms such as thirdparty wafer foundries and module assembly and test capabilities our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with a particular cm 

we depend on our cms to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis we do not generally have longterm capacity commitments with our cms and substantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product further from time to time our cms will cease to or will become unable to manufacture a component for us as the lead time needed to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new cm is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source and there may be other constraints on our ability to change cms in addition qualifying such cms is often expensive and they may not produce products as costeffectively as our current suppliers in any such circumstances we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize tsmc to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers tsmc manufactured approximately 87 of the wafers manufactured by our cms during fiscal year 2020 our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice or raise their prices to us all of which could harm our business results of operations and gross margin for example huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” as well as many of its suppliers have significantly increased their wafer orders from tsmc due to certain us export restrictions on sales to huawei this has caused and may continue to cause some dislocations in the semiconductor supply chain which may result in reduced or untimely wafer deliveries to us 

any substantial disruption in tsmc’s supply of wafers to us or in the other contract manufacturing services that we utilize as a result of a natural disaster political unrest military conflict geopolitical turmoil trade tensions medical epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic climate change economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationships and results of operations 

we also depend on our cms to timely develop new advanced manufacturing processes including in the case of wafer fabrication transitions to smaller geometry process technologies if these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or to deliver products to our customers which could result in loss of revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers 

we purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing processes and those of our cms rely on many materials including silicon gaas and inp wafers copper lead frames precious and rare earth metals mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we purchase a significant portion of our materials components and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers some of which are single source suppliers as certain materials are highly specialized the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source during fiscal year 2020 we purchased approximately twothirds of the materials for our manufacturing processes from six materials providers we do not generally have longterm contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity price increases capacity constraints or other factors and could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry for example due to the covid19 pandemic we have experienced some supply constraints including with respect to wafers and substrates additionally the supply of these materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the us and its trading partners particularly china in the event that we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials or at reasonable prices the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 

a general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and results of operations in recent periods investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook which have significantly increased as a result of the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected market and business conditions in general macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expenses and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of trade tensions between the us and china has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in chinese markets or compete effectively with chinese companies sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the us and its trading partners especially china and possible decoupling of the us and china economies could result in a global economic slowdown and longterm changes to global trade such events may also i cause our customers and consumers to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers and iv intensify pricing pressures any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations 

global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

a majority of our products are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition as of november 1 2020 approximately 49 of our employees were located outside the us multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

• changes in political regulatory legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil including terrorism war or political or military coups or civil disturbances or political instability foreign and domestic 

• restrictive governmental actions such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments data privacy regulations and trade protection measures including increasing protectionism importexport restrictions importexport duties and quotas trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs all of which have increased under the current us administration 

• difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support and transportation delays 

• potential inability to localize software products for a significant number of international markets 

• difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets 

• public health or safety concerns medical epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 and other natural or manmade disasters 

• nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets and 

• changes in us and foreign tax laws 

a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business in addition the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may in some cases conflict with each other although our policies prohibit us our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices there can be no assurance that all of our employees distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anticorruption or other policies and procedures any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our business is subject to various international laws and other legal requirements including packaging product content labor and importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current us administration especially in light of ongoing trade tensions 

with china we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations for example huawei one of our customers is subject to certain us export restrictions which has required us to suspend sales to huawei until we obtain licenses from the us department of commerce which we may be unable to do so in a timely manner or at all the us government may also add additional chinese companies to its restricted entity list andor technologies to its list of prohibited exports to china all of which have and will adversely affect our ability to sell our products and our revenue these restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be imposed on us companies by the chinese or other governments will likely limit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur for example if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt crossborder manufacturing relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to comply with these requirements we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution 

our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the ftc if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations our business could be harmed 

we are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners including product inventory levels and product sellthrough 

we sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally sales to distributors accounted for 42 of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended november 1 2020 and are subject to a number of risks including 

• fluctuations in demand based on our distributors’ product inventory levels and end customer demand in a given quarter 

• our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers 

• our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause 

• our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers and 

• our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale of these products 

in addition we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors which exposes us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks 

we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products as a result our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical devices and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications in such event failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 

our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team 

our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management team and in particular the services of mr hock e tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel including cyber security experts as well as effective sales professionals through acquisitions we may make from time to time or otherwise as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand in addition current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers further limiting the pool of available talent further our employees may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little or no notice we grant equity awards to the substantial majority of our employees and we believe these awards provide a powerful longterm retention incentive to our employees however we may be incorrect in this assumption particularly if there is a material and persistent decline in the price of our common stock in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future equity compensation plans needed to continue with our current equity granting philosophy as a result we may be limited in our ability to grant equitybased incentives which may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities 

any acquisitions we may undertake and their integration involve risks and uncertainties such as 

• unexpected delays challenges and related expenses and disruption of our business 

• diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities 

• incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense assuming liabilities some of which may be unexpected and ongoing or new lawsuits related to the transaction or otherwise potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements 

• the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business as well as implementing our own management information systems operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations 

• our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s products financial disclosures accounting practices legal tax and other contingencies compliance with local laws and regulations and interpretations thereof in the us and multiple international jurisdictions 

• additional acquisitionrelated debt which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow 

• dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders 

• difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees vendors and customers and 

• inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction which may result in us not realizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction 

in addition us and foreign regulatory approvals required in connection with an acquisition may take longer than anticipated to obtain may not be forthcoming or may contain burdensome conditions which may jeopardize delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction to us 

from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investments any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us or at all disruption to other parts of our business potential loss of employees or customers or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions in addition dispositions may include the transfer of technology andor the licensing of certain ip rights to thirdparty purchasers which could limit our ability to utilize such ip rights or assert these rights against such thirdparty purchasers or other third parties 

we may be involved in legal proceedings including ip anticompetition and securities litigation employeerelated claims and regulatory investigations which could among other things divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip rights 

we are often involved in legal proceedings including cases involving our ip rights and those of others anticompetition and commercial matters acquisitionrelated suits securities class action suits employeerelated claims and other actions from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries such as the ongoing investigation by the ftc into certain of our contracting and business practices which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anticompetition legislation regulation and enforcement activity litigation or settlement of such actions regardless of their merit or involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries can be costly lengthy complex and time consuming diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel 

the industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including actions by patentholding companies that do not make or sell products from time to time third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their ip rights to technologies that are important to our business for example in august 2020 judgment was entered against broadcom and apple for infringement of certain patents pursuant to which california institute of technology was awarded past damages of 2702 million from broadcom and 8378 million from apple plus in each case interest thereon from the date of the judgment for which apple is seeking indemnification from broadcom although we are appealing this judgment there are no assurances that we will be successful 

many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements andor the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for thirdparty ip infringement claims including costs to defend those claims and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings however our cms and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such thirdparty claims claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could be required to 

• cease the manufacture use or sale of the infringing products processes or technology andor make changes to our processes or products 

• pay substantial damages for past present and future use of the infringing technology including up to treble damages if willful infringement is found 

• pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments andor cease certain conduct andor modify our contracting or business practices in connection with any unfavorable resolution of a governmental investigation 

• expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology 

• license technology from the thirdparty claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

• enter into crosslicenses with our competitors which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories 

• pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with noninfringing technology or 

• relinquish ip rights associated with one or more of our patent claims 

any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals as well as stockholder derivative suits the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed 

our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control in addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “risk factors” section these factors include among others 

• customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customers 

• the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in enduser demand for our customers’ the products 

• fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers 

• the shift to cloudbased it solutions and services such as hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers 

• the timing of new software contracts and renewals as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund to customers any prepaid amounts under the contract 

• our ability to timely develop introduce and market new products and technologies 

• the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue and other nonproduct revenue 

• new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors 

• seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets 

• timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies and 

• timing of any regulatory changes particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs and tax reform 

the foregoing factors are often difficult to predict and these as well as other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results in addition a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time 

failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

we make significant decisions including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept production schedules levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements which may not be accurate 

during the covid19 pandemic we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of global economic uncertainty and supply chain challenges more typically however to ensure the availability of our products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts which are not binding as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence because certain of our sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income 

conversely customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice we may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing or test capacity to meet such increases in demand this could damage our customer relationships reduce revenue growth and margins subject us to additional liabilities harm our reputation and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand from time to time these factors together with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for enduser products high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable if we cannot offset industry or market downturns our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue 

our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes 

winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer a delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time may strain our resources and those of our cms in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses further often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products andor the manufacturing line for those products the qualification process can take significant time and resources delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue finally customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 

competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements often aggressive pricing practices and in some cases new delivery methods we expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets 

some of our competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition a larger installed customer base larger technical staffs more established relationships with vendors or suppliers or greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development technical and marketing resources than us we also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry open source authors who may provide software and ip for free competitors who may offer their products through tryandbuy or freemium models and customers who may develop competing products 

in addition the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape we expect this trend to continue which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets a larger customer base a more comprehensive ip portfolio or better patent protection than us 

the actions of our competitors in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular could have a substantial adverse impact on us further competitors may leverage their superior market position as well as ip or other proprietary information including interface interoperability or technical information in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities research and development facilities warehouses or other significant operations or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes our fort collins and breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the fbar components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphidebased wafers used in our fibre optics products respectively many of our facilities and those of our cms and suppliers are located in california and the pacific rim region which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located the czech republic india israel singapore and the us with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas and our primary warehouse is in malaysia 

a prolonged disruption at or shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses for any reason especially our colorado singapore malaysia and pennsylvania facilities or those of our cms or suppliers due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness including covid19 would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose us to claims by our customers result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand from time to time this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities which often involves substantial cost and other risks such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation forgo sales or lose customers as a result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed all of which could adversely affect our results of operations similarly reduced product yields due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers all of which could cause us to forgo sales incur liabilities or lose customers and harm our results of operations 

in addition future government restrictions imposed as a result of the covid19 pandemic that limit our manufacturing capabilities could severely impact our ability to manufacture our proprietary products adversely affecting our wireless business 

any failure of our it systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide necessary services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business depends on various it systems and outsourced it services we rely on thirdparty vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services and to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems services provided by these third parties include services related to financial reporting product orders and shipping human resources benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform we may be unable to collect any damages 

any failure of these internal or thirdparty systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our product mix price erosion acquisitions we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity prices 

our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and nonproduct revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternatives more complex engineering requirements lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin 

in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin furthermore fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our margins we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices some of which are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 

our gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and by expenses related to such acquisitions 

we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights including unauthorized use of our products the usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect the ip rights that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that 

• our ip rights will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged or in the case of thirdparty ip rights licensed to us be licensed to others 

• our ip rights will provide competitive advantages to us 

• rights previously granted by third parties to ip licensed or assigned to us including portfolio crosslicenses will not hamper our ability to assert our ip rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes 

• any of our pending or future patent trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 

• our ip rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak or 

• we have sufficient ip rights to protect our products or our business 

effective ip protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the us and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions in addition when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 

we also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip rights particularly exclusive licenses may limit our ability to assert those ip rights against third parties including the licensee of those rights in addition we may acquire companies with ip that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties these licensing obligations may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip rights from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights including in some cases against our customers and suppliers claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us conversely third parties may pursue ip litigation against us including as a result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments which could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 

if our software products do not remain compatible with everchanging operating environments platforms or thirdparty products demand for our products and services could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business 

we may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities w e must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments 

further our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties if we lose access to thirdparty code and specifications for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software providers and hardware manufacturers including some of our largest vendors adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems applications or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business 

many of our existing customers have multiyear enterprise software license agreements some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope on terms that are commercially attractive to us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense 

some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive the loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products 

certain software we use is from open source code sources which under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

some of our products contain software from open source code sources the use of which may subject us to certain conditions including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available further although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements it is common for such software to be available “asis” with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions such use under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters for example it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 

highly complex products such as those we offer may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions software documentation or enhancements are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development if any of our products or thirdparty components used in our products contain defects or bugs or have reliability quality or compatibility problems we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production or deployment of a new product we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall repair or replacement costs significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases as a result if there is systemwide failure or an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s system it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to resolve these problems we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected 

product or products these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others for example if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s endproduct delivery we may be required under the terms of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays as a result our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements short product cycles and evolving industry standards and new delivery methods in addition semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our products may be reduced increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use and store collectively “process” a high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business this creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business depending on the type of personal information the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments privacy legislation and other data protection regulations enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment the cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data governance measures could be significant as they may create additional burdensome security business process business record or data localization requirements concerns about government interference sovereignty expanding privacy cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers and our products and services particularly in cloud computing artificial intelligence and our own data management practices the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy data governance or cyber security obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation substantial fines and damages and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws which could increase our costs restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of international laws and regulations relating to the use disposal cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could among other things require us to modify our manufacturing processes restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronic products sold in various countries including the us china and japan and in the european union increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to reengineer our products such reengineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may also experience claims from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims 

social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers 

there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt 

procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions an increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the un global compact a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop implement and disclose sustainability policies and practices these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or cms to comply with such policies or provisions a customer may stop purchasing products from us and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

in addition as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

the average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit 

the semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications as a result the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by among other things pricing pressures from our customers in the past we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors in addition some of our customer agreements provide for volumebased pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes reducing manufacturing costs or developing new and higher valueadded products on a timely basis 

a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers’ suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information as well as our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on a number of thirdparty cloudbased and other service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to among other things human resources electronic communication services and certain finance functions and we are out of necessity dependent on the security systems of these providers in addition all software including the security technologies produced by us have had occasionally in the past and may have in the future vulnerabilities that if left unmanaged could reduce the overall level of security 

accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access of our facilities our information systems or the systems of our service providers or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees we have from time to time also been subject to or attempts of unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own it networks as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially while we have taken steps to secure our networks and systems we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyberattack or information security incident while our workforce works remotely 

certain of our software products are intended to manage and secure it infrastructures and environments and as a result we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks open source code or other thirdparty software used in these products could also be targeted additionally we use thirdparty data centers which may also be subject to hacking or accidental incidents although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers cyber security attacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources additionally efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers a successful cyber security attack involving our products and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness and adversely affect our reputation relationship with our customers and our financial results 

any theft accidental loss or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other things unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information difficulty in marketing our products allegations by our customers that we have not performed 

our contractual obligations litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations such as the general data protection regulation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition interruptions in our operations and services or disruptions to the functionality provided by our software including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could adversely impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses 

we operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars however some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into us dollars 

in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks including the use of derivative instruments these strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses 

risks related to our taxes 

changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

corporate tax reform antibaseerosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been and will likely continue to be proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate 

after enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax reform act” most of our income is taxable in the us with a significant portion taxable under the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” regime beginning in fiscal year 2027 the deduction allowable under the gilti regime will decrease from 50 to 375 which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income further if the us tax rate increases or the deduction allowable under the gilti regime is further reduced or eliminated our provision for income taxes net income and cash flows would be adversely impacted 

in addition many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices the oecd is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax namely the “pillar one” and “pillar two” proposals as a result of this heightened scrutiny prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change further many jurisdictions have passed and may pass additional legislation intended to alleviate the economic burdens of covid19 and to fund economic recovery and growth including various temporary tax incentives or relief and restricted tax measures which could result in future tax increases we cannot predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our tax liabilities and are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new legislation to our financial statements 

any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies regulations or guidance enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

if the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect our corporate income taxes could significantly increase 

our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example absent our principal tax incentives from the singapore economic development board which is scheduled to expire in 2025 the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our singapore taxable income would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled 

to expire in fiscal year 2028 each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may in some instances be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled in addition we may be required or elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep an incentive which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive our tax incentives and tax holiday before taking into consideration the effects of the 2017 tax reform act and other indirect tax provisions increased the benefit from income taxes by approximately 833 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by 198 for fiscal year 2020 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 

our benefit from income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially adversely affect financial results 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide benefit from income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 

our benefit from income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

• reorganization or restructuring of our businesses tangible and intangible assets outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure 

• jurisdictional mix of our income and assets 

• changes in the allocation of income and expenses including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure acquisitions or tax law 

• changes in us and foreign tax laws and regulations changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxation of us income generated from foreign sources the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules 

• tax effects of increases in nondeductible employee compensation and 

• changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services the sale of products the arrangement of financing and the grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis our taxable income is dependent upon acceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of comprehensive treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful result in adjustments for prior or future years the effects of any such changes could subject us to higher taxes and our earnings results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected 

in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

the internal revenue service may not agree that prior to our redomiciliation into the us our predecessor broadcom limited should have been treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

although broadcom limited our predecessor was a singapore entity the internal revenue service “irs” may assert that following our acquisition of brcm broadcom limited should have been treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if the irs were to determine that under section 7874 of the code the former shareholders of brcm held at least 60 of the vote or 

value of the ordinary shares of broadcom limited immediately after our acquisition of brcm such percentage referred to as the “section 7874 percentage” broadcom limited would be treated as a “surrogate foreign corporation” and several limitations could then apply to brcm for example brcm would be prohibited from using its net operating losses foreign tax credits or other tax attributes to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following our acquisition of brcm or any income received or accrued during such period by reason of a license of any property by brcm to a foreign related person moreover in such case section 4985 of the code and rules related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectly by certain brcm “disqualified individuals” including former officers and directors of brcm at a rate equal to 15 but only if a gain is otherwise recognized by brcm former shareholders as a result of our acquisition of brcm if the irs were to determine the section 7874 percentage was 80 or more then broadcom limited would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

while we believe the section 7874 percentage was significantly less than 60 determining the section 7874 percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our position 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy 

as of november 1 2020 the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes and term loans was 35610 million and 5888 million respectively we expect to maintain significant levels of indebtedness going forward 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities which we do not typically hedge against 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

• making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other purposes and 

• potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs 

in addition our variable rate indebtedness use libor as a benchmark for establishing the effective interest rate libor is being phased out and the consequences of changing to alternative reference rates could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies while we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets could 

• adversely affect the trading price of or market for our debt securities 

• increase interest expense under our term facilities 

• increase the cost of and adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing debt and 

• adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt 

the instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business to plan for or react to changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed which could result in a default on our indebtedness 

risks related to owning our common stock 

at times our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

the trading price of our common stock has at times fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and others including 

• issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts 

• fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

• announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors 

• announcements of or expectations of additional debt or equity financing transactions 

• stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock 

• issuance and subsequent sale of common stock upon conversion of our 800 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a “mandatory convertible preferred stock” 

• hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our mandatory convertible preferred stock or common stock and 

• unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business 

these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or currency fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future we are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions securities litigation against us including the lawsuits related to such transactions could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

a substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall 

as of september 30 2020 we believe 11 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active institutional investors who held approximately 33 of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate with capital world investors being our largest stockholder with approximately 10 of our outstanding shares of common stock these investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock in addition any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries in addition any payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to and conditioned upon our payment of quarterly dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the caption “risk factors” or in other parts of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a global technology leader that designs develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions we develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog iiiv based products we have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms we offer a cyber security solutions portfolio including endpoint network information and identity security solutions we also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking “fc san” products and related software in the form of modules switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products 

during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended november 1 2020 “fiscal year 2020” we changed our organizational structure resulting in two reportable segments semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software in addition during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020 we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling general and administrative expenses to more closely align these costs with the segment benefiting from the shared expenses prior period segment results have been recast to conform to the current presentation 

our strategy is to combine bestofbreed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions with unmatched scale on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading business and government customers we seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of categoryleading businesses and technologies as well as investing extensively in research and development to ensure our products retain their technology leadership this strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results 

the demand for our products has been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factors including the following 

• gain or loss of significant customers 

• general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete 

• our distributors’ product inventory and end customer demand 

• the rate at which our present and future customers and endusers adopt our products and technologies in our target markets and the rate at which our customers products that include our technology are accepted in their markets 

• the shift to cloudbased it solutions and services such as hyperscale computing which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers and 

• the timing rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders 

our fiscal year 2020 and our fiscal year ended november 3 2019 “fiscal year 2019” were 52week fiscal years compared to our fiscal year ended november 4 2018 “fiscal year 2018” which was a 53week fiscal year 

covid19 update 

in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and the various resulting government directives we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities we modified our workplace practices globally which resulted in most of our employees working remotely for an extended periods of time while we have implemented a phasedin return of employees to many of our facilities if the spread of covid19 worsens significantly we may need to further limit onsite operations or otherwise modify our business practices we continue to monitor the implications of the covid19 pandemic on our business as well as our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

the demand environment for our semiconductor products was consistent with our expectations for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 with continued demand for products and infrastructure to support a dramatic increase around the world in remote or telework and learning due to covid19 while we continue to see robust demand in this area the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over the longer term to date the impact of covid19 on the demand environment for our software products has been limited on the product supply side we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain due to the pandemic including with respect to wafers and substrates as a result supply lead times are still extended and we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner however the disruptions in our outsourced assembly and test capacity that we experienced previously as a result of covid19 related shutdowns have now largely resolved 

we have also taken various actions to derisk our business in light of the ongoing uncertainty for example we are largely building semiconductor products to order instead of based on customer forecasts in addition during the fourth fiscal quarter we continued to strengthen our balance sheet including closely managing working capital and reducing our total debt outstanding 

overall in light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic our ability to predict the impact of covid19 on our business in future periods remains limited the effects of the pandemic on our business are unlikely to be fully realized or reflected in our financial results until future periods 

fiscal year highlights 

highlights during fiscal year 2020 include the following 

• we acquired the symantec corporation enterprise security business the “symantec business” 

• we generated 12061 million of cash from operations 

• we paid 5534 million in cash dividends 

acquisitions and divestitures 

the discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 

acquisition of symantec corporation’s enterprise security business 

on november 4 2019 we completed the purchase and assumption of certain assets and certain liabilities respectively of the symantec business for 107 billion in cash the “symantec asset purchase” we financed this acquisition with the net proceeds from the borrowings under the november 2019 term loans as defined in note 10 “borrowings” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

acquisition of ca inc 

on november 5 2018 we acquired ca inc “ca” for 188 billion in aggregate cash purchase consideration and assumed 225 billion of outstanding unsecured bonds the “ca merger” we financed the ca merger with 18 billion of term loans as well as cash on hand of the combined companies we also assumed all eligible unvested ca equity awards in the transaction on december 31 2018 we sold veracode inc “veracode” a subsidiary of ca and provider of application security testing solutions to thoma bravo llc for cash consideration of 950 million before working capital adjustments 

acquisition of brocade communications systems inc 

on november 17 2017 we acquired brocade communications systems inc “brocade” for 60 billion in cash including retirement of their term loan debt which we financed using the net proceeds from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes issued in october 2017 as well as cash on hand we also assumed all eligible unvested brocade equity awards in the transaction on december 1 2017 we sold certain brocade business for an aggregate of 800 million in cash 

net revenue 

a majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products as well as from modules switches and subsystems net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms 

our overall net revenue as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments has varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuations in endmarket demand including the effects of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part i item 1 business under “seasonality” of this annual report on form 10k 

original equipment manufacturers “oems” or their contract manufacturers and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales to serve customers around the world we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges we also sell our products to a wide variety of oems or their contract manufacturers we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large oem customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries such as contract manufacturers many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development this has enabled us to build our extensive intellectual property “ip” portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements including substantial systemlevel knowledge this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 

our traditional software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex we believe our enterprisewide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth 

costs and expenses 

cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations which include stockbased compensation expense related occupancy computer services equipment costs manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustments inventory adjustments including writedowns for inventory obsolescence and acquisition costs which include direct transaction costs and acquisitionrelated costs 

although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 

cost of subscriptions and services cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses personnel costs include stockbased compensation expense 

total cost of revenue also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges 

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies including stockbased compensation expense these expenses also include project material costs thirdparty fees paid to consultants prototype development expense allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 

selling  general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel including stockbased compensation expense sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives advertising costs trade shows corporate marketing promotion travel related to our sales and marketing operations related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management finance human resources and other administrative personnel including stockbased compensation expense outside professional fees allocated facilities costs acquisitionrelated costs and other corporate expenses 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and inprocess research and development “iprd” which is initially capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset in connection with the acquisitions upon completion of each underlying project iprd assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges restructuring impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs alignment of our global manufacturing operations rationalizing product development program costs facility and lease abandonments fixed asset impairment iprd impairment and other exit costs including curtailment of service or supply agreements 

interest expense interest expense includes coupon interest commitment fees accretion of original issue discount amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments 

other income net other income net includes interest income gains or losses on investments foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 

provision for benefit from income taxes we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment our tax incentives from the singapore economic development board provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments these singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in november 2025 the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 

each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions if we cannot or elect not to comply with any such operating conditions specified we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled we may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements before taking into consideration the effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act “2017 tax reform act” and other indirect tax impacts the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately 833 million 923 million and 590 million for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense 

the 2017 tax reform act made significant changes to the us internal revenue code including 1 a decrease in the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 2 the accrual of us income tax on foreign earnings when earned allowing certain foreign dividends to then be taxexempt rather than deferring such income tax payments until the foreign earnings are repatriated into the us and 3 the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated nonus earnings of us controlled foreign corporations the “transition tax” following the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued guidance for situations when there is insufficient information to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax reform act based on our interpretation of the 2017 tax reform act and the sec’s guidance we recognized an income tax benefit of 7278 million during fiscal year 2018 during fiscal year 2019 we recorded an income tax provision of 113 million from a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 benefit as a result of proposed us treasury regulations issued in fiscal year 2019 related to the 2017 tax reform act we also recognized an income tax benefit of 1162 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of our redomiciliation to the united states in april 2018 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies include revenue recognition business combinations valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill inventory valuation income taxes retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions stockbased compensation and employee bonus programs see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition we account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations each party’s rights can be identified payment terms can be identified the 

contract has commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services 

we recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates however because of the inherent nature of estimates there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results we also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue 100 of potential rebates at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 

our contracts may contain more than one of our products and services each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation when available we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies technology lifecycles and market conditions 

we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights our estimate of the value of the customer’s option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised 

certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit we estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed restructuring liabilities preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on histor ical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies revenue growth rate customer rampup period technology obsolescence rates expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances considers various macroeconomic industryspecific and companyspecific factors these factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends ii significant companyspecific actions including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of events and circumstances if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value the 

income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses and taxes as well as working capital and capital asset requirements these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows the market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash and debt 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including purchased iprd property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trends the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business that the longlived asset relates to we also consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the longlived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand additionally our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 

income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances if we determine that a valuation allowance is required such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made conversely if we determine that a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes interest and penalties will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed a further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to us based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap one assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs other assumptions include the expected longterm return on plan assets expected future salary increases the health care cost trend rate expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

for our us and nonus plans we use october 31 the month end closest to our fiscal year end as the annual discount rate measurement date to determine the present value of future benefit payments  the us discount rates are based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields the discount rate for nonus plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense 

the u s expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fullymatched liabilitydriven investment strategy 

actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experiences we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating the us pension and postretirement benefit obligations each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated 40 million impact on the benefit obligations as of the fiscal year 2020 measurement date each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption or expected rate of return assumption would not have a material impact on annual net retirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ending october 31 2021 “fiscal year 2021” 

stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense consists of expense for restricted stock units “rsus” and stock options granted to employees and nonemployees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with broadcom employee stock purchase plan “espp” we recognize compensation expense for timebased stock options and espp rights based on the estimated grantdate fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the blackscholes valuation model 

certain equity awards include both timebased and marketbased conditions and are accounted for as marketbased awards the fair value of these marketbased awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model 

employee bonus programs our employee bonus programs which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics in the first fiscal quarter of the year if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated a variable proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100 achievement of the targets and metrics the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100 and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved in subsequent quarters we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter 

fiscal year presentation 

we operate on a 52 or 53week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to october 31 in a 52week year and the first sunday in november in a 53week year our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 consisted of 52 weeks fiscal year 2018 consisted of 53 weeks 

the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k are presented in accordance with gaap and expressed in us dollars 

results of operations 

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented 



net revenue 

historically a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue sales of products to distributors accounted for 42 and 46 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively direct sales to wt microelectronics a distributor accounted for 13 and 17 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 30 of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 15 and 20 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true of our wireless products as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of launches and seasonal variations in sales of mobile handsets in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related challenges and uncertainties may also cause our net revenue to fluctuate significantly and adversely affect our results of operations as discussed above additionally if export restrictions on one of our larger customers continue revenue in future periods may continue to be adversely impacted 

although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in penang malaysia we disclose net revenue by country based on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by distributors oems contract manufacturers channel partners or software customers in each of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 approximately 35 of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to china including hong kong compared to approximately 50 for fiscal year 2018 however the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated are frequently located in countries other than china including hong kong as a result we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product to end customers located in china including hong kong 

the following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented 





our total net revenue increased primarily due to contributions from the symantec enterprise security solutions in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased primarily due to delays in the production ramp of a new mobile handset by a major customer that resulted in lower than expected shipments in the year partially offset by higher demand for our networking and storage products net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our symantec enterprise security solutions 

gross margin 

gross margin was 13516 million or 57 of net revenue for fiscal year 2020 compared to 12483 million or 55 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019 the increase was primarily due to contributions from our symantec enterprise security solutions as well as favorable product mix within our semiconductor solutions segment compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 272 million or 6 in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of the symantec business partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense resulting from restructuring actions 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 226 million or 13 in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of the symantec business and associated acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense including stockbased compensation resulting from restructuring actions 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses increased 503 million or 27 in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the addition of amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition of the symantec business 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses decreased 538 million or 73 in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior fiscal year  the decrease was primarily due to higher employee termination costs as well as lease and other exit costs resulting from the ca merger in the prior fiscal year 

segment operating results 



operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased slightly primarily due to higher demand for storage products largely offset by delays in the production ramp of a new mobile handset by a major customer which resulted in lower than expected shipments in the year operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our symantec enterprise security solutions 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs restructuring impairment and disposal charges and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses increased 5 in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior year fiscal period primarily due to higher amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by lower restructuring impairment and disposal charges and stockbased compensation expense 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense interest expense was 1777 million and 1444 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase was primarily due to the increase in debt associated with the financing of our acquisition of the symantec business as well as losses on extinguishment of debt related to refinancing activities during fiscal year 2020 

other income net other income net which includes interest income gains or losses on investments foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items was 206 million and 226 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease was primarily due to lower gains on investments partially offset by a 116 million onetime gain from the lapse of a tax indemnification arrangement 

benefit from income taxes benefit from income taxes was 518 million and 510 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and expense the recognition of gross uncertain tax benefits as a result of lapses of statues of limitations the remeasurement of certain foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities and excess benefit from stockbased awards the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to excess tax benefits from stockbased awards the recognition of gross uncertain tax benefits as a result of audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations deferred tax remeasurement in state and foreign jurisdictions internal reorganizations and the partial release of our valuation allowance as a result of the ca merger this was partially offset by a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 provision resulting from regulations issued related to the 2017 tax reform act 

fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented 



the following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented

our total net revenue increased primarily due to the ca merger in fiscal year 2019 net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased due to lower demand for our wireless content in mobile handsets as well as lower demand for our broadband optocoupler settop box and server storage connectivity products fiscal year 2018 semiconductor solutions revenue benefited from a later than typical new mobile handset ramp with a major customer in the first quarter which resulted in higher shipments in that quarter as well as an extra week in the fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 2019 net 

revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our mainframe and enterprise software solutions 

gross margin 

gross margin was 12483 million or 55 of net revenue for fiscal year 2019 compared to 10733 million or 52 of net revenue for fiscal year 2018 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to contributions from our mainframe and enterprise software solutions and favorable product mix within our semiconductor solutions segment compared to the prior fiscal year partially offset by higher amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges as a result of the ca merger and higher stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 928 million or 25 in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 21 and 18 for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase was primarily due to the ca merger and higher stockbased compensation expense offset by lower variable employee compensation expense stockbased compensation expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the multiyear equity grants of time and marketbased rsus the “multiyear equity awards” in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of equity awards and the assumed ca equity awards our stockbased compensation expense for fiscal year 2019 included employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values than those granted in prior years which also contributed to the increase 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 653 million or 62 in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 8 and 5 for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase was primarily due to the ca merger and higher stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the multiyear equity awards the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of equity awards and the assumed ca equity awards 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses increased 1357 million or 251 in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the addition of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the ca merger

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses increased 517 million or 236 in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year  the increase was primarily due to employee termination costs as well as lease and other exit costs resulting from the ca merger 

segment operating results 



operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased primarily due to lower demand for our wireless content in mobile handsets as well as lower demand for our optocoupler broadband server storage connectivity and settop box products fiscal year 2018 semiconductor solutions operating income benefited from a later than typical new mobile handset ramp with a major customer in the first quarter which resulted in higher shipments in that quarter as well as an extra week in the fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 2019 operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our mainframe and enterprise software solutions 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs restructuring impairment and disposal charges and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses increased 61 in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense and restructuring impairment and disposal charges primarily related to the ca merger 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense interest expense was 1444 million and 628 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively interest expense was higher in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to interest on the debt we incurred to finance the ca merger in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 

other income net other income net was 226 million and 144 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains on investments partially offset by losses on foreign currency remeasurement 

benefit from income taxes benefit from income taxes was 510 million and 8084 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to excess benefit from stockbased awards the recognition of gross unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations net of increases in balances related to tax positions taken during the current year benefit from deferred tax measurement in state and foreign jurisdictions benefit related to internal reorganizations and benefit from the partial release of our valuation allowance as a result of the ca merger partially offset from a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 provision resulting from regulations issued related to the 2017 tax reform act the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and as a result of our redomiciliation to the united states on april 4 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 

our primary sources of liquidity as of november 1 2020 consisted of i 7618 million in cash and cash equivalents ii cash we expect to generate from operations and iii available capacity under our 5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” in addition we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time 

our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from i business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time ii working capital requirements iii research and development and capital expenditure needs iv cash dividend payments if and when declared by our board of directors v interest and principal payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and vi payment of income taxes our ability to fund these requirements will depend in part on our future cash flows which are determined by our future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operations and the revolving facility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months we expect a slight increase in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction or evaluation of potential transactions could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities including acquisitions or unanticipated capital expenditures our business and financial condition could suffer in such circumstances we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing however we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to service our senior unsecured notes outstanding term loans and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above 

in addition we may at any time and from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders andor exchanges for equity or debt in openmarket purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such tenders exchanges or purchases if any will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine and will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

working capital 

working capital increased to 5524 million at november 1 2020 from 3018 million at november 3 2019 the increase was attributable to the following 

• cash and cash equivalents increased to 7618 million at november 1 2020 from 5055 million at november 3 2019 primarily due to 27802 million in proceeds from longterm borrowings 12061 million in net cash provided by operating activities and 218 million in proceeds from the sales of businesses partially offset by 20099 million of debt repayments 10700 million paid for the symantec asset purchase 5534 million of dividend payments and 765 million in payments of employee withholding taxes related to net share settled equity awards see the “cash flows” section below for further details 

• current portion of longterm debt decreased 1960 million primarily due to repayment of certain debt partially offset by additional amounts coming due within twelve months 

• other current assets increased to 977 million at november 1 2020 from 729 million at november 3 2019 primarily due to increases in prepaid taxes and shortterm investments 

• inventory increased to 1003 million at november 1 2020 from 874 million at november 3 2019 primarily due to timing of customer product ramps 

these increases in working capital were offset in part by the following 

• other current liabilities increased to 3831 million at november 1 2020 from 2616 million at november 3 2019 primarily due to increases in contract liabilities interest payable taxes payable and lease liabilities resulting from the adoption of accounting standard codification topic 842 “topic 842” partially offset by repayments of notional pooling liabilities 

• accounts receivable decreased to 2297 million at november 1 2020 from 3259 million at november 3 2019 primarily due to revenue linearity and additional receivables sold through factoring arrangements 

• employee compensation and benefits increased to 877 million at november 1 2020 from 641 million at november 3 2019 primarily due to the employee bonus plan 

working capital decreased to 3018 million at november 3 2019 from 6769 million at november 4 2018 the decrease was attributable to the following 

• accounts receivable decreased to 3259 million at november 3 2019 from 3325 million at november 4 2018 primarily due to a higher volume of trade accounts receivable factoring partially offset by higher revenue 

• inventory decreased to 874 million at november 3 2019 from 1124 million at november 4 2018 primarily due to our continued focus on inventory management 

• current portion of longterm debt increased 2787 million primarily due to certain unsecured senior notes becoming due within the next twelve months 

• other current liabilities increased to 2616 million at november 3 2019 from 812 million at november 4 2018 primarily due to the ca merger and increases in contract liabilities from the adoption of topic 606 notional pooling liabilities restructuring reserves taxes payable and interest payable 

these decreases in working capital were offset in part by the following 

• cash and cash equivalents increased to 5055 million at november 3 2019 from 4292 million at november 4 2018 primarily due to 30034 million in proceeds from longterm borrowings 9697 million in net cash provided by operating activities 3679 million of mandatory convertible preferred stock issuance proceeds and 957 million in proceeds from sale of veracode partially offset by 16800 million of debt repayments 16027 million paid for the ca merger 5435 million of common stock repurchases 4235 million of dividend payments and 972 million in payments of employee withholding taxes related to net share settled equity awards see the “cash flows” section below for further details 

• other current assets increased to 729 million at november 3 2019 from 366 million at november 4 2018 primarily due to assets acquired in the ca merger and increases in contract assets from adoption of topic 606 and prepaid taxes 

capital returns 



during fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 we paid approximately 765 million 972 million and 56 million respectively in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards we withheld approximately 3 million 4 million and 02 million shares of common stock from employees in connection with such net share settlements in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

pursuant to an 18 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by our board of directors we repurchased and retired approximately 21 million and 32 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 25852 and 22760 during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively this authorization ended on november 3 2019 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash and other items and changes in assets and liabilities the 2364 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was due to higher cash flows from net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in the operating assets and liabilities 

the 817 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities cash flows from net income adjusted for noncash items were relatively flat as higher net income in fiscal year 2018 reflected a significant noncash income tax benefit principally resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and the impact from our redomiciliation to the united states in fiscal year 2018 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures and investments and proceeds from sales of businesses and assets the 4313 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily related to a 5161 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions partially offset by 739 million less in proceeds received from sales of businesses 

the 10748 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily related to 16027 million paid for the ca merger in fiscal year 2019 partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses as well as lower capital expenditures 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds and payments related to our longterm borrowings dividend and distribution payments stock repurchases and the issuances of stock the 4877 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 5531 million decrease in net proceeds from borrowings as a result of debt repayments the absence of preferred stock issuance which generated 3679 million net proceeds in fiscal year 2019 and a 1299 million increase in dividend payments partially offset by the absence of repurchases of common stock under our repurchase program which ended in fiscal year 2019 as compared to 5435 million of repurchases in fiscal year 2019 

the 17606 million increase in cash related to financing activities for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a 14207 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings net proceeds of 3679 million from issuance of preferred stock and a 1823 million decrease in common stock repurchases under our repurchase program partially offset by a 1237 million increase in dividend and distribution payments and a 916 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards

contractual commitments 



debt principal interest and fees represents principal estimated interest and fees on our borrowings for borrowings subject to a floating interest rate the estimated interest was based on the rate in effect during the last month of the fiscal year ended november 1 2020 

purchase commitments represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services primarily inventory that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with construction of our new campuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and therefore cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above 

other contractual commitments represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to information technology human resources and other service agreements 

operating lease and finance lease obligations  represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under noncancelable leasing arrangements 

due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at november 1 2020 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 3185 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of november 1 2020 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis these supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for redesign or qualification our longterm relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans and to monitor our suppliers financial health some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique or highly specialized components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we may use a number of techniques including in some cases qualifying more than one source of supply redesigning products for alternative components and incremental or in some cases lifetime purchases of affected parts for supply buffer 

competition 

the markets in which we participate are highly competitive our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market additionally our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors including quality technical performance price product features product system compatibility systemlevel design capability engineering expertise responsiveness to customers new product innovation product availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 

in the semiconductor market we compete with integrated device manufacturers fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems our primary competitors are analog devices inc cisco systems inc cree inc finisar corp globalfoundries hamamatsu photonics kk heidenhain corporation hisilicon technologies co ltd intel corp lumentum operations llc macom technology solutions holdings inc marvell technology group ltd mediatek inc mellanox technologies inc microsemi corp mitsubishi electric corporation murata manufacturing co ltd nxp semiconductors nv qorvo inc qualcomm inc quantenna communications inc acquired by on semiconductor corporation st microelectronics nv renesas electronics corporation skyworks solutions inc sumitomo corporation tdkepc corporation toshiba corporation and texas instruments inc we compete based on the strength and expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise fbar technology amplifier design module integration proprietary materials processes multiple storage protocols and mixedsignal design our broad product portfolio support of key industry standards reputation for quality products and our customer relationships 

in the infrastructure software market we compete with large vendors of hardware and operating system software and cloud service providers who continue to both expand their product and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines our primary competitors are appdynamics inc acquired by cisco atlassian corporation plc bmc software inc beyondtrust compuware corporation cyberark software ltd international business machines corporation micro focus international plc microsoft corporation mulesoft inc acquired by salesforcecom inc new relic inc oracle corporation sailpoint inc servicenow inc solarwinds inc splunk inc and vmware inc we compete based on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools breadth and synergy of offerings our platform and hardware independence our global reach and our deep customer relationships and industry experience 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade secrets and similar ip as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through security measures to protect our trade secrets we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 

as of november 3 2019  we had 21677 us and other patents and 1593 us and other pending patent applications our research and development efforts presently result in approximately 100 new patent applications per year relating to a wide range of asic isolation encoder led rf and optoelectronic components enterprise storage products hdd silicon pcie usb and other standard io devices ethernet and fibrechannel connectivity and controllers settop box socs cable modem socs broadband access socs wireless connectivity socs switchingrouting socs high performance processor socs infrastructure software and associated applications the expiration dates of our patents range from 2019 to 2038  with a small number of patents expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 

we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 

we and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of ip licensing and crosslicensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors a portion of our revenue comes from ip licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to such ip we also license thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities products and manufacturing processes historically licenses of the thirdparty technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty ip infringement claims claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us with respect to any ip rights claims against us or our customers or distributors we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product pay damages expend resources to develop noninfringing technology seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or relinquish patents or other ip rights 

with respect to our infrastructure software the source code for our products is protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted work except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products rather onpremise customers typically access only the executable code for our products and saas customers access only the functionality of our saas offerings under certain contingent circumstances some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrow arrangement that enables them to obtain a limited right to access our source code 

employees 

as of november 3 2019  we had approximately 19000 employees worldwide by geography approximately 53 of our employees are located in north america 35 in asia and 12 in europe the middle east and africa in the us none of our employees are represented by a labor union a small number of our employees in other countries are represented by workers councils or labor unions or are party to collective bargaining agreements 

environmental and other regulation 

our semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health safety and the environment these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air water and soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we are also subject to regulation by the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 

we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements including legislation enacted in the us european union and china among a growing number of jurisdictions which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging these laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 

backlog 

our semiconductor sales are generally made pursuant to shortterm purchase orders these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be and often are rescheduled cancelled or modified on relatively short notice without substantial penalty in addition our mainframe and enterprise software contracting model for the majority of our customers which are for enterprisewide licenses provide for termination thereof by our customers at any time for any reason as a result we recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over time therefore we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products these products have historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly with our wireless communications products we have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend our business operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock the following important factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec press releases communications with investors and oral statements 

risks related to our business 

the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on a small number of end customers oems their respective contract manufacturers and certain distributors for a majority of our business revenue and results of operations for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  sales to distributors accounted for 46 and 34 of our net revenue respectively direct sales to wt microelectronics accounted for 17 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019  we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 30 and more than 40 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 20 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019 and approximately 25 for fiscal year 2018  this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant customers 

in addition our top customers’ purchasing power has in some cases given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and should we fail to comply with such terms might also result in substantial liability that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover the terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customers generally do not include commitments by those customers to purchase any specific quantities of products from us even in those instances where we enter into an arrangement under which a customer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us provided that we are able to meet specified development supply and quality commitments the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect as a result we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements if we do not perform under these arrangements we could also be liable for significant monetary damages in addition we are selling an increasing amount of our semiconductor products through a limited number of distributors which may expose us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks 

the loss of or any substantial reduction in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes thirdparty wafer foundry and module assembly and test capabilities referred to as contract manufacturers our semiconductor products require semiconductor wafer manufacturers with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer 

we depend on our contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis although we often have longterm contracts with our contract manufacturers we do not generally have longterm capacity commitments we obtain substantially all of our manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and our contract manufacturers have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product further from time to time our contract manufacturers will cease to or will become unable to manufacture a component for us as the lead time needed to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new contract manufacturer is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source for the wafers or other contract manufacturing services we require and there may be other constraints on our ability to change contract manufacturers in addition qualifying such contract manufacturers is often expensive and they may not produce products as costeffectively as our current suppliers which would reduce our margins in any such circumstances we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize tsmc to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers tsmc manufactured approximately 85 of the wafers manufactured by our contract manufacturers during fiscal year 2019  our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice or raise their prices to us all of which could harm our business results of operations and gross margin 

any substantial disruption in tsmc’s supply of wafers to us or in the other contract manufacturing services that we utilize as a result of a natural disaster political unrest military conflict economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationships and results of operations 

we also depend on our contract manufacturers to timely develop new advanced manufacturing processes including in the case of wafer fabrication transitions to smaller geometry process technologies if these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or to deliver products to our customers which could result in loss of revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers 

we purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing processes and those of our contract manufacturers rely on many materials including silicon gallium arsenide and indium phosphide wafers copper lead frames precious and rare earth metals mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials components and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers some of which are single source suppliers during the fiscal year 2019  we purchased more than twothirds of the materials for our manufacturing processes from five materials providers substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis and we do not generally have longterm contracts with our materials providers suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases capacity constraints or other factors which may lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry in the event that we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials or at reasonable prices the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 

a general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry an increase in trade tensions with us trading partners or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and results of operations in recent periods investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected market and business conditions in general macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expenses and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt an escalation of recent trade tensions between the us and china has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm our ability to participate in chinese markets or compete effectively with chinese companies sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the us and its trading partners especially china could result in a global economic slowdown and longterm changes to global trade such events may also i cause our customers and consumers to reduce delay or forgo technology spending ii result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs iii lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers and iv intensify pricing pressures any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 

a majority of our products are produced sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition as of november 3 2019  approximately 51 of our employees are located outside the us multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 



 a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations including anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws moneylaundering regulations and export regulations in addition the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may in some cases conflict with each other although our code of ethics and business conduct and other policies prohibit us our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices there can be no assurance that all of our employees distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anticorruption policies and procedures any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may pursue acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of and investment in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities such as our recent acquisition of the symantec business we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities or to consummate any such transactions in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction including our recent acquisition of the symantec business 

any acquisitions we may undertake and their integration including our recent acquisition of the symantec business involve risks and uncertainties such as 



in addition regulatory approvals required in connection with an acquisition such as those from the us department of justice the us federal trade commission “ftc” the european commission directorategeneral for competition or where applicable the china state administration for market regulation may take longer than anticipated to obtain may not be obtained at all or may contain materially burdensome conditions if any conditions or changes to the structure of an acquisition are required to obtain these regulatory approvals they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of such acquisition or reducing our anticipated benefits of the transaction if we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any such approvals or if we fail to comply with any such conditions our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

these difficulties may be complicated by factors such as the size of the business or entity acquired geographic and cultural differences lack of experience operating in the industry or geographic markets of the acquired business potential loss of key employees and customers the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business performance problems with the acquired business’ technology failure to realize the benefits of transition services arrangements exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition adverse tax consequences and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects or synergies expected from any such acquisition 

if we fail to complete an announced acquisition our stock price could fall to the extent the price reflects an assumption that such acquisition will be completed and we may incur significant unrecoverable costs further the failure to consummate an acquisition may result in negative publicity and adversely impact our relationships with our customers vendors and employees we may become subject to legal proceedings relating to the acquisition and the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses achieve anticipated levels of profitability of the acquired business improve margins of the acquired businesses and products or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition could materially harm our business operating results and margins 

from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investments each of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations any future dispositions we may make could involve risks and uncertainties including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition any such dispositions could result in disruption to other parts of our business potential loss of employees or customers or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions for example in connection with such dispositions we often enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships including longterm research and development arrangements and sales arrangements or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition dispositions may include the transfer of technology andor the licensing of certain ip rights to thirdparty purchasers which could limit our ability to utilize such ip rights or assert these rights against such thirdparty purchasers or other third parties 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

our business is subject to various international laws and other legal requirements including packaging product content labor and importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and applicable executive orders and many of our semiconductor products are regulated or sold into regulated industries these laws regulations and orders are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current us administration especially in light of recent trade tensions with china we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations for example on may 15 2019 the us department of commerce added huawei technologies co ltd one of our customers to its “entity list” and placed certain export restrictions on huawei and its suppliers which required us to suspend certain sales to huawei during the pendency of such restrictions and which has had a corresponding adverse effect on our revenue 

in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur for example if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt crossborder manufacturing relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to comply with these requirements we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution in addition it is expected that the current us administration’s trade policy will promote us manufacturing and 

manufacturers it is unclear what effect this will have on us as a multinational company that conducts business worldwide or on our suppliers customers contract manufacturers and oems 

our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the ftc if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations our business could be harmed 

we are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners including product inventory levels and product sellthrough 

we sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally sales to distributors accounted for 46 of our net revenue in fiscal year 2019 and are subject to a number of risks including 

 one of our significant distributors tech data corporation recently agreed to be acquired by a private equity firm which may result in a change in their operations business focus and financial capacity if and when completed this could adversely affect our relationship with and ability to sell products to them 

we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products as a result our semiconductor products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical devices and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications in such event failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 

our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team 

our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management team and in particular the services of mr hock e tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 

our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel including cybersecurity experts as well as effective sales professionals through acquisitions we may make from time to time or otherwise we have historically encountered some difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand in addition current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified engineers further limiting the pool of available talent further our employees including employees whom we have retained as a result of an acquisition may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little or no notice as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset we have granted multiyear equity awards to most of our employees these awards approximate four consecutive annual grants that vest in four tranches with successive fouryear vesting periods while we believe these awards provide a powerful longterm retention incentive to employees we may be incorrect in this assumption particularly if there is a material and persistent decline in the price of our stock in addition we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future equity compensation plans as a result we may be limited in granting equitybased incentives and may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary 

personnel any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be involved in legal proceedings including ip anticompetition and securities litigation employeerelated claims and regulatory investigations which could among other things divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our ip rights 

we are often involved in legal proceedings including cases involving our ip rights and those of others anticompetition and commercial matters acquisitionrelated suits securities class action suits employeerelated claims and other actions some of these actions may seek injunctive relief including injunctions or exclusion orders against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries such as the ongoing investigations by the ftc and the european commission into certain of our contracting practices which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings litigation or settlement of such actions regardless of their merit or involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel and is frequently costly with the related expenditures unpredictable an unfavorable resolution of a governmental investigation may include among others fines or other orders to disgorge profits or make other payments andor the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct andor modify our contracting practices any or all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including actions by patentholding companies that do not make or sell products from time to time third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent copyright trademark trade secret and other ip rights to technologies that are important to our business 

many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements andor the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for thirdparty ip infringement claims including costs to defend those claims and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings however our contract manufacturers and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such thirdparty claims claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in ip litigation if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could be required to 

 any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals as well as stockholder derivative suits the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed 

our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 the foregoing factors are often difficult to predict and these as well as other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results in addition a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time 

failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

we make significant decisions including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept production schedules levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the shortterm nature of many customers’ commitments our customers’ ability to reschedule cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for our customers’ products as well as seasonal or cyclical trends in their industries or the semiconductor industry 

to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products particularly for our largest customers we typically start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts which are not binding as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence because certain of our sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income 

conversely customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice we may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand this could damage our customer relationships reduce revenue growth and margins subject us to additional liabilities harm our reputation and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand from time to time these factors together with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for enduser products high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable if we cannot offset industry or market downturns our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue 

our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes 

winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any a delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins occurring at the same time may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional unanticipated costs and expenses often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units from us until they qualify the products andor the manufacturing line for those products the qualification process can take significant time and resources and we may not always be able to satisfy customers’ qualification requirements delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue finally customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 

competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements often aggressive pricing practices and in some cases new delivery 

methods we expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets 

in addition the competitive landscape is changing in these industries as a result of a trend toward consolidation some of our direct competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors we expect this consolidation trend to continue which may result in the combined competitors having greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development or marketing resources than us in addition some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets a larger customer base or more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection than us 

we compete with integrated device manufacturers and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits “ics” we also face competition from manufacturers of ics as well as customers that may develop their own ic products our competitors in these markets range from large international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products and devices to smaller companies specializing in niche markets and new technologies 

our competitors also include large vendors of hardware and operating system software and cloud service providers some of our competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition a larger installed base of customers in any particular market larger technical staffs more established relationships with hardware vendors or greater financial technical and marketing resources than us we also face competition from numerous startups and smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry open source authors who may provide software and intellectual property for free competitors who may offer their products through tryandbuy or freemium models and customers who may develop competing products 

the actions of our competitors in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular could have a substantial adverse impact on us further competitors may leverage their ip or other proprietary information including interface or interoperability information in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities research and development facilities or other significant operations or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes in order to protect our ip to accelerate time to market of our products and to ensure supply of certain components our fort collins and breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the film bulk acoustic resonator components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphidebased wafers used in our fibre optics products respectively many of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california and the pacific rim region which has above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition our research and development personnel are primarily concentrated in china czech republic india israel malaysia singapore south korea taiwan colorado california and pennsylvania with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas 

a prolonged disruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities for any reason especially our colorado singapore and pennsylvania facilities or those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness at one or more of these facilities would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose us to claims by our customers resulting in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity at our own manufacturing facilities which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must maintain appropriate capacity at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand for our proprietary products from time to time this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities which often involves substantial cost and other risks such as delays in completion such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation forgo sales or lose customers as a result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities all of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

any failure of our it systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide necessary services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on various it systems including networks applications internal it systems and personnel and outsourced services for among other things financial reporting and product orders and shipments we rely on thirdparty vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services on a timely and effective basis and to adequately address cybersecurity threats to their own systems services provided by these third parties include certain services related to shipping human resources benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us we may be unable to collect on any award of damages and any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs we may incur as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform under its agreement with us upon expiration or termination of any of our thirdparty vendor agreements we may not be able to timely replace the vendor on terms and conditions including service levels and costs which are favorable to us in addition a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete 

any failure of these internal or thirdparty systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand manage our supply chain and production facilities fulfill customer orders and report financial and other information on a timely and accurate basis 

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our product mix price erosion acquisitions we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity prices 

our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and nonproduct revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternatives more complex engineering requirements lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin for us in the future 

our gross margin may also be adversely affected by expenses related to the acquisitions of businesses such as amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and impairment charges furthermore businesses or companies that we acquire may have different gross margin profiles than us and could therefore also affect our overall gross margin 

in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities such as depreciation expense will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin furthermore fluctuations in commodity prices either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy or as a result of price increases passed on to us by our suppliers could negatively impact our margins we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices some of which including gold and fuel prices are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 

we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business if we are unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights including unauthorized use of our products the usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect the ip rights that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that 



 in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the us and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions we may elect to abandon or divest patents or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications due to strategic concerns or other factors in addition when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 

we also generate some of our revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip rights particularly exclusive licenses may limit our ability to assert those ip rights against third parties including the licensee of those rights in addition we may acquire companies with ip that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties these licensing obligations may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip rights from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights including in some cases against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships such as customers and suppliers claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us conversely third parties may pursue ip litigation against us including as a result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our ip against others in addition such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 

if our software products do not remain compatible with everchanging operating environments platforms or thirdparty products demand for our products and services could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business 

the largest suppliers of systems and computing software are in most cases the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers particularly in the mainframe space these companies periodically modify or introduce new operating systems systems software and computer hardware which could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies’ hardware or software additionally we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space to compete effectively customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments 

further our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties if we lose access to thirdparty code and specifications for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software providers and hardware manufacturers including some of our largest vendors adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems applications or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business 

many of our existing customers have multiyear enterprise license agreements some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts these customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our 

competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope on terms that are commercially attractive to us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

our sales to government clients subject us to uncertainties regarding fiscal funding approvals renegotiations or terminations at the discretion of the government as well as audits and investigations which could result in litigation penalties and sanctions including early termination suspension and debarment 

our multiyear contracts signed with the us federal government and other us state and local government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government termination renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales revenue and reputation additionally our government contracts are generally subject to certain requirements some of which are generally not present in commercial contracts andor may be complex as well as to audits and investigations failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense 

some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive the loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products 

certain software we use is from open source code sources which under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

some of our products contain software from open source code sources the use of which may subject us to certain conditions including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available further although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements it is common for such software to be available “asis” with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions such use under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may in the future lead to significant expense our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters for example it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 

highly complex products such as those we offer may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions software documentation or enhancements are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development if any of our products including the products of companies we have acquired or thirdparty components used in our products contain defects or bugs or have reliability quality or compatibility problems we 

may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production of or deployed a new product we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall repair or replacement costs significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases as a result if there is systemwide failure it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to resolve these problems we may have to invest significant capital and other resources these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others for example if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s endproduct delivery we may be required under the terms of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays in addition if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity security or availability occurs in one of our enduser customer’s systems regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and we would likely lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected product or products as a result our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we make substantial investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new technologies to keep pace with technological advances and to remain competitive in our business and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements short product cycles and evolving industry standards new delivery methods and require substantial investment in our research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products in addition semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries this requires us to adapt our products and manufacturing processes to these new technologies which requires expertise in new procedures our failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development we expect the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our products may be reduced significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

we collect use store or otherwise process personal information which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business 

we collect use and store collectively “process” a high volume variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with the operation of our business particularly in relation to our symantec business the personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal state local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security as well as contractual commitments any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions fines or litigation and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 

privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment the cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure or perceived failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and substantial fines and damages the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

further to ensure that its products are continually enhanced to protect against constantly evolving increasingly sophisticated and widespread cyberthreats nortonlifelock inc relied on threat intelligence gathered from both its consumer business and the symantec business we and nortonlifelock inc have agreed to continue sharing threat intelligence relating to the symantec business and the nortonlifelock inc consumer business respectively following the closing of the transaction failure to continue to receive such threat intelligence could cause the symantec business products to become less effective and adversely affect our business 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws which could increase our costs restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of international laws and regulations relating to the use disposal cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could among other things require us to modify our manufacturing processes restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in various countries including the us china japan and in the european union increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to reengineer our products such reengineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may also experience claims from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims 

social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers 

there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions an increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the un global compact a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop implement and disclose sustainability policies and practices these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply with such policies or provisions a customer may stop purchasing products from us and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

in addition as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products since our supply chain is complex we are not currently able to definitively ascertain the origins of all of the minerals and metals used in our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

the average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross profit 

the semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications as a result the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by among other things pricing pressures from our customers in the past we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors in addition some of our customer agreements provide for volumebased pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes reducing manufacturing costs or developing new and higher valueadded products on a timely basis 

a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers’ suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information as well as our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on a number of thirdparty cloudbased and other service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to among other things human resources electronic communication services and certain finance functions and we are out of necessity dependent on the security systems of these providers 

accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties or our employees or contractors of our facilities our information systems or the systems of our cloudbased or other service providers or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees in addition we have from time to time also been subject to unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own it networks 

certain of our software products are intended to manage and secure it infrastructures and environments and as a result we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cybersecurity attacks open source code or other thirdparty software used in these products could also be targeted additionally we use thirdparty data centers including for part of our saas business which may also be subject to hacking incidents although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on us and our customers cybersecurity attacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources additionally efforts by malicious cyber actors or others could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers a successful cybersecurity attack involving our products and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness 

any theft or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other things unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information difficulty in marketing our products allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations such as the general data protection regulation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition interruptions in our operations and services or disruptions to the functionality provided by our software including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network could adversely impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us in addition our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports significant expense to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act even though as of november 3 2019  we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes including to reflect our integration of the symantec business as well as any future acquisitions we may undertake this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive time consuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as we grow our business or acquire other businesses our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls either in our existing business or in businesses that we acquire could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remedy any material weakness our financial statements may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statements our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital markets may be restricted the trading price of our common stock may decline and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities including the sec or the nasdaq global select market 

current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards especially concerning revenue recognition may negatively impact our financial results 

our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying those standards in our accounting policies new standards changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation have required and in the future may require us to change our accounting policies and procedures or implement new or enhance existing systems for example asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers “topic 606” became effective for us starting with fiscal year 2019 in connection with the ca merger and our changes to ca’s business strategy including our adoption of a policy that allows customers to terminate their ca software contracts for convenience we have been required to establish revenue recognition accounting policies and procedures under topic 606 that we believe are appropriate for the business as we intend to conduct it while we believe our policies and procedures are reasonable and appropriate they are based on methods estimates and judgments that are subject to risks uncertainties assumptions and changes that could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses 

we operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars however some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into us dollars 

in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks including the use of derivative instruments these strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions for example the us tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax reform act” adopted broad us corporate income tax reform which among other things reduced the us corporate income tax rate but imposed baseerosion prevention measures on earnings of nonus subsidiaries of us entities as well as the transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated nonus earnings of us controlled foreign corporations 

in addition many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies regulations or guidance enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

if the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable in part or in whole for any reason or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase 

our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example our principal tax incentives from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore provides that any qualifying income we earn in singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of singapore income tax absent these tax incentives the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our singapore taxable income would be 17 these singapore tax incentives are expected to expire in november 2025 subject to potential extensions which we may or may not be able to obtain and any subsequent changes in incentive scope or legislative developments we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 the tax incentives and tax holiday that we have obtained are also 

subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may in some instances be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to keep the incentive which may not be as beneficial to us as the present structure or tax strategy our tax incentives and tax holiday before taking into consideration the effects of the 2017 tax reform act and other indirect tax provisions increased the benefit from income taxes by approximately 923 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by 220 for fiscal year 2019 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 

our provision for income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors including reorganizations or restructurings of our businesses or assets jurisdictional revenue mix and changes in tax regulations or policy and may be further impacted by corporate transactions all of which could materially adversely affect financial results 

we are a multinational company subject to tax in various tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 we have adopted transfer pricing policies between our affiliated entities our policies call for the provision of services the sale of products the advance of financing and grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of comprehensive treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful result in adjustments for prior or future years as a result of these adjustments we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings and results of operations would be adversely affected in any period in which such determination is made 

although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liabilities prescribed in the relevant accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions which if resolved unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes and our payment obligation with respect to any such taxes 

in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

the internal revenue service may not agree that prior to the redomiciliation transaction broadcomsingapore should have been treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

although broadcomsingapore is a singapore entity the internal revenue service “irs” may assert that following our acquisition of brcm broadcomsingapore should have been treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if the irs were to determine that under section 7874 of the code the former shareholders of brcm held at least 60 of the vote or value of the ordinary shares of broadcomsingapore immediately after our acquisition of brcm such percentage referred to as the “section 7874 percentage” broadcomsingapore would be treated as a “surrogate foreign corporation” and several limitations could then apply to brcm for example brcm would be prohibited from using its net operating losses foreign tax credits or other tax attributes to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following our acquisition of brcm or any income received or accrued during such period by reason of a license of any property by brcm to a foreign related person moreover in such case section 4985 of the code and rules related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectly by certain brcm “disqualified individuals” including former officers and directors of brcm at a rate equal to 15 but only if a gain is otherwise recognized by brcm former shareholders as a result of our acquisition of brcm if the irs were to determine the section 7874 percentage was 80 or more then broadcomsingapore would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

while we believe the section 7874 percentage was significantly less than 60 determining the section 7874 percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our position 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions could limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and exposes us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

as of november 3 2019  our indebtedness under the 2017 senior notes the 2019 senior notes and the assumed ca senior notes was 17550 million  11000 million and 1850 million  respectively in addition 1600 million was outstanding under the 2019 term loans we also borrowed 12 billion of term loans to fund the acquisition of the symantec business we expect to maintain significant levels of indebtedness going forward 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 in addition our variable rate indebtedness may use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies while we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets could 



the instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business to plan for or react to changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed which could result in a default on our indebtedness 

risks relating to owning our common stock 

at times our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

the trading price of our common stock has at times fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and others including 



these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or currency fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future we are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions securities litigation against us including the lawsuits related to such transactions could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes these purposes include operational spending capital spending acquisitions repayment of debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments changes in cash flows tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program 

a substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock in the public market by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall 

as of september 30 2019  we believe 11 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active institutional investors who held approximately 33 of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate with capital world investors being our largest stockholder with approximately 11 of our outstanding shares of common stock these investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock in addition any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time in addition any payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to and conditioned upon our payment of quarterly dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors management’s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions earnings levels contractual restrictions cash position and overall financial condition and changes to our business model the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law contractual restrictions and our corporate structure because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries 

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 

from time to time we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release this guidance which consists of forwardlooking statements is prepared by our management and is qualified by and subject to the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles examines or reviews the guidance and accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 

guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity is inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of these ranges the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies as our management will necessarily be less familiar with their business procedures and operations accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material investors should also recognize 

that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data are forecast in light of the foregoing investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance and such differences may be adverse and material

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the caption “risk factors” or in other parts of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a global technology leader that designs develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions we develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog iiiv based products we have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms through our fiscal year ended november 3 2019 “fiscal year 2019” we had three reportable segments semiconductor solutions infrastructure software and intellectual property “ip” licensing 

our strategy is to combine bestofbreed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions with unmatched scale on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading business and government customers we seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of categoryleading businesses and technologies as well as investing extensively in research and development to ensure our products retain their technology leadership this strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results 

the demand for our products has been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factors including the following 

 uncertainty in global economic conditions poses significant risks to our business for example customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news which would in turn adversely affect product demand and our results of operations 

our fiscal year 2019 and our fiscal year ended october 29 2017 “fiscal year 2017” were 52week fiscal years compared to our fiscal year ended november 4 2018 “fiscal year 2018” which was a 53week fiscal year the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 resulted in higher net revenue gross margin dollars research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal years 2019 and 2017 

fiscal year highlights 

highlights during fiscal year 2019 include the following 



 recent developments 

purchase of symantec corporation’s enterprise security business 

on november 4 2019 we completed the purchase and assumption of certain assets and certain liabilities respectively of symantec corporation’s enterprise security business “symantec business” for approximately 107 billion in cash the “symantec asset purchase” 

in connection with the symantec asset purchase we entered into a credit agreement with certain financial institutions to provide i up to 12 billion in term loans to fund the symantec asset purchase and related working capital needs and ii 35 billion in term loans to refinance certain existing senior notes maturing in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending november 1 2020 “fiscal year 2020” 

the discussions below relate to our business reporting segments and financial results for fiscal year 2019 and prior periods and do not include any impact from or information relating to the symantec asset purchase 

acquisitions and divestitures 

the discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 

acquisition of ca inc 

on november 5 2018 the “ca acquisition date” we acquired ca for approximately 188 billion in aggregate cash purchase consideration and assumed 225 billion of outstanding unsecured bonds the “ca merger” we financed the ca merger with 18 billion of term loans borrowed on the ca acquisition date as well as cash on hand of the combined companies see note 9  “ borrowings ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further detail we also assumed all eligible unvested ca equity awards in the transaction on december 31 2018 we sold veracode inc “veracode” a subsidiary of ca and provider of application security testing solutions to thoma bravo llc for cash consideration of 950 million before working capital adjustments 

acquisition of brocade communications systems inc 

on november 17 2017 we acquired brocade communications systems inc “brocade” for approximately 60 billion in cash including retirement of their term loan debt the “brocade merger” which we financed using the net proceeds from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes issued in october 2017 as well as cash on hand we also assumed all eligible unvested brocade equity awards in the transaction on december 1 2017 we sold certain brocade businesses for an aggregate of 800 million in cash 

net revenue 

a majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products as well as from modules switches and subsystems net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan develop automate manage and secure applications across mainframe distributed mobile and cloud platforms our three reportable segments in fiscal year 2019 were semiconductor solutions infrastructure software and ip licensing 

our overall net revenue as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments has varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuations in endmarket demand including the effects of seasonality which are discussed in detail in part i item 1 business under “seasonality” of this annual report on form 10k 

original equipment manufacturers “oems” or their contract manufacturers and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales to serve customers around the world we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges we also sell our products to a wide variety of oems or their contract manufacturers we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large oem customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries such as contract manufacturers many of our major customer 

relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development this has enabled us to build our extensive ip portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements including substantial systemlevel knowledge this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 

our traditional software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and are highly complex we believe our enterprisewide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth 

costs and expenses 

cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations which include stockbased compensation expense related occupancy computer services equipment costs manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustments inventory adjustments including writedowns for inventory obsolescence and acquisition costs which include direct transaction costs and integrationrelated costs 

although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 

cost of subscriptions and services cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses personnel costs include stockbased compensation expense 

total cost of revenue also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges 

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies including stockbased compensation expense these expenses also include project material costs thirdparty fees paid to consultants prototype development expense allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 

selling  general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel including stockbased compensation expense sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives advertising costs trade shows corporate marketing promotion travel related to our sales and marketing operations related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management finance human resources and other administrative personnel including stockbased compensation expense outside professional fees allocated facilities costs acquisitionrelated costs and other corporate expenses 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year to 25 years  we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and inprocess research and development “iprd” which is initially capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset in connection with acquisitions upon completion of each underlying project iprd assets are reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful lives 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges restructuring impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs alignment of our global manufacturing operations rationalizing product development program costs iprd impairment fixed asset impairment facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs including curtailment of service or supply agreements 

interest expense interest expense includes coupon interest commitment fees accretion of original issue discount and amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs and expenses related to debt modification 

other income net other income net includes interest income gains losses on investments and on foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 

provision for benefit from income taxes the us tax cuts and jobs act  “2017 tax reform act” made significant changes to the us internal revenue code including 1 a decrease in the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 2 the accrual of us income tax on foreign earnings when earned allowing 

certain foreign dividends to then be taxexempt rather than deferring such income tax payments until the foreign earnings are repatriated into the us and 3 the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated nonus earnings of us controlled foreign corporations the “transition tax” following the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued guidance for situations when there is insufficient information to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax reform act based on our interpretation of the 2017 tax reform act and the sec’s guidance we recognized an income tax benefit of 7278 million during fiscal year 2018 during fiscal year 2019 we recorded an income tax provision of 113 million from a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 benefit as a result of proposed us treasury regulations issued in fiscal year 2019 related to the 2017 tax reform act we also recognized an income tax benefit of 1162 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of our redomiciliation to the united states in april 2018 the “redomiciliation transaction” 

we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment our tax incentives from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore provide that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments these singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in november 2025 subject in certain cases to potential extensions which we may or may not be able to obtain absent these tax incentives the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17  we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 

the tax incentives and tax holiday that we have obtained are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements before taking into consideration the effects of the 2017 tax reform act and other indirect tax impact the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately 923 million and 590 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively for fiscal year 2017 the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately 237 million  

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies include revenue recognition business combinations valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill inventory valuation income taxes retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions stockbased compensation and employee bonus programs see note 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition we account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations each party’s rights can be identified payment terms can be identified the contract has commercial substance and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services 

we recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates however because of the inherent nature of estimates there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results we also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue 100 of potential rebates at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 

our contracts may contain more than one of our products and services each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation when available we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors including but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices through different sales channels gross margin objectives internal costs competitor pricing strategies technology lifecycles and market conditions 

we also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights our estimate of the value of the customer’s option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised 

certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit we estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable we do not recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned 

business combinations accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed restructuring liabilities preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on histor ical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop iprd into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances considers various macroeconomic industryspecific and companyspecific factors these factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends ii significant companyspecific actions including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of events and circumstances if we determine that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses and taxes as well as working capital and capital asset requirements these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market 

weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows the market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash and debt 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including purchased iprd property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trends the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business that the longlived asset relates to we also consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the longlived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand additionally our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 

income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances if we determine that a valuation allowance is required such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made conversely if we determine that a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the morelikelythannot threshold for recognition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes interest and penalties will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed a further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to us based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap one assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs other assumptions include the expected longterm return on plan assets expected future salary increases the health care cost trend rate expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates — november 3 2019 and november 4 2018  for both us and nonus plans in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively the us discount rates are based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields the discount rate for nonus plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense 

the u s expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fullymatched liabilitydriven investment strategy 

actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating us pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of november 3 2019  each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated 40 million impact on the benefit obligations as of november 3 2019  each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption or expected rate of return assumption would not have a material impact on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2020  

stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense consists of expense for rsus and stock options granted to employees and nonemployees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with broadcom employee stock purchase plan “espp” we recognize compensation expense for timebased stock options and espp rights based on the estimated grantdate fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the blackscholes valuation model 

certain equity awards include both timebased and marketbased conditions and are accounted for as marketbased awards the fair value of these marketbased awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model 

employee bonus programs our employee bonus programs which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics in the first fiscal quarter of the year if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated a variable proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100 achievement of the targets and metrics the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100 and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved in subsequent quarters we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter

results of operations 

fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented 



net revenue 

historically a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue sales of products to distributors accounted for 46 and 34 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively direct sales to wt microelectronics a distributor accounted for 17 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019 no direct customer represented more than 10 of our net revenue during fiscal year 2018 we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 30 and more than 40 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 20 of our net revenue for fiscal year 2019 and approximately 25 for fiscal year 2018  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally if export restrictions on one of our larger customers continue revenue in future periods may continue to be adversely impacted 

from time to time some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true for our wireless products as fluctuations may be magnified by the launches of and seasonal variations in sales of mobile handsets 

although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in penang malaysia we disclose net revenue by country based on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by distributors oems contract manufacturers channel partners or software customers in fiscal year 2019 approximately 35 of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to china including hong kong compared to approximately 50 for both fiscal years 2018 and 2017 however the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated are frequently located in countries other than china including hong kong as a result we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product to end customers located in china including hong kong 

the following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented 





our total net revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of ca in fiscal year 2019  net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased due to lower demand for our wireless content in mobile handsets as well as lower demand for our broadband optocoupler settop box and server storage connectivity fiscal year 2018 semiconductor solutions revenue benefited from a later than typical new mobile handset ramp with a major customer in the first quarter which resulted in higher shipments in that quarter as well as an extra week in the fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 2019 net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our ca mainframe and enterprise software products 

gross margin 

gross margin was 12483 million for fiscal year 2019 compared to 10733 million for fiscal year 2018  gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 55 in fiscal year 2019 from 52 for fiscal year 2018  these increases were primarily due to contributions from our ca mainframe and enterprise software products and favorable product mix within our semiconductor solutions segment these increases were partially offset by higher amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges as a result of the ca merger and higher stockbased compensation expense we expect to incur additional amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in future periods as a result of our acquisition of the symantec business and any further acquisitions we may make 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 928 million  or 25  in fiscal year 2019  research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 21 and 18 for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of ca and higher stockbased compensation expense offset by lower variable employee compensation expense stockbased compensation expense increased primarily due to the issuance of multiyear equity grants of time and marketbased rsus the “multiyear equity awards” in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of equity awards and the assumed ca equity awards our stockbased compensation expense for fiscal year 2019 included employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values than those granted in prior years which also contributed to the increase we expect to incur additional research and development expense in future periods as a result of our acquisition of the symantec business and any future acquisitions we may make 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 653 million  or 62  in fiscal year 2019  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 8 and 5 for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of ca and higher stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the multiyear equity awards the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of equity awards and the assumed ca equity awards 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses increased 1357 million  or 251  in fiscal year 2019 the increase was primarily due to the addition of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the ca merger we expect to incur additional amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in future periods as a result of our acquisition of the symantec business and any further acquisitions we may make 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses increased 517 million  or 236  in fiscal year 2019  the increase was primarily due to employee termination costs as well as lease and other exit costs resulting from the ca merger we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of our acquisition of the symantec business and any further acquisitions we may make 

segment operating results 



operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased primarily due to lower demand for our wireless content in mobile handsets as well as lower demand for our optocoupler broadband server storage connectivity and settop box products fiscal year 2018 semiconductor solutions operating income benefited from a later than typical new mobile handset ramp with a major customer in the first quarter which resulted in higher shipments in that quarter as well as an extra week in the fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 2019 operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our ca mainframe and enterprise software products 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs restructuring impairment and disposal charges and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses increased 61 in fiscal year 2019 mainly due to higher amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense and restructuring impairment and disposal charges primarily related to the ca merger the increase in stockbased compensation expense also due to the issuance of the multiyear equity awards and the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of certain timebased equity awards 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense interest expense was 1444 million and 628 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively interest expense was higher in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to interest on the debt we incurred to finance the ca merger in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 we expect to incur additional interest expense in future periods as a result of term loan indebtedness associated with any future acquisitions including our acquisition of the symantec business 

other income net other income net was 226 million and 144 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase was primarily due to an increase in unrealized gains on investments partially offset by losses on foreign currency remeasurement 

benefit from income taxes benefit from income taxes was 510 million and 8084 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to 232 million of excess benefit from stockbased awards that vested or were exercised during the year 131 million from the recognition of gross unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations net of increases in balances related to tax positions taken during the current year 80 million of benefit from deferred tax measurement in state and foreign jurisdictions 66 million of benefit related to internal reorganizations and 54 million of benefit from the partial release of our valuation allowance as a result of the ca merger partially offset by 113 million of expense from a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 benefit as a result of proposed us treasury regulations issued in fiscal year 2019 related to the 2017 tax reform act the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and the redomiciliation transaction 

fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented 



the following table sets forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented 

net revenue 





our total net revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of brocade in fiscal year 2018 as well as strong organic yearoveryear growth 

net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets and a later than typical new handset ramp with a major customer which resulted in product shipments that typically would have occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 occurring in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 additionally net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to an increase in demand for our networking applicationspecific integrated circuit “asic” products these increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand for our set top box and optical products net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased due to contributions from our fc san business 

gross margin 

gross margin was 10733 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to 8509 million for fiscal year 2017 gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 52 in fiscal year 2018 from 48 for fiscal year 2017 the fiscal year 2018 increases were primarily due to the addition of brocade products as well as a more favorable product mix partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 466 million  or 14  in fiscal year 2018 research and development expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenue at 18 and 19 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in research and development expense dollars for fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of brocade higher stockbased compensation expense and higher variable employee compensation expense due to fiscal year 2018 operating performance stockbased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 267 million  or 34  in fiscal year 2018 selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat at 5 and 4 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of brocade and associated acquisitionrelated costs as well as higher stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased 1223 million  or 69  in fiscal year 2018 the decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of broadcom corporation partially offset by the addition of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the brocade merger 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses increased 58 million  or 36  in fiscal year 2018  the increase was primarily due to an increase in restructuring activities resulting from the brocade merger partially offset by a decrease in restructuring activities resulting from our acquisition of broadcom corporation 

litigation settlements 

during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 we incurred 14 million and 122 million of litigation charges respectively associated with certain legal settlement agreements 

segment operating results 



operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets as well as a later than typical new handset ramp with a major customer which resulted in higher shipments in fiscal year 2018 additionally we experienced an increase in demand for our networking asic products these increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand for our settop box and optical products operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our fc san business 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charges acquisitionrelated costs charges for litigation settlements and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses decreased 6 in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to decreases in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and charges for litigation settlements substantially offset by increases in stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs purchase accounting effect on inventory and restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense interest expense was 628 million and 454 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively interest expense was higher in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to the october 2017 issuance of unsecured senior notes as well as debt commitment fees paid in connection with the brocade merger 

impairment on investment we recognized 106 million in fiscal year 2018 for an other than temporary impairment of one of our cost method investments 

loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt was 166 million for fiscal year 2017 we issued senior unsecured notes in january 2017 to repay all of the term loans outstanding under our guaranteed collateralized credit agreement dated february 1 2016 as a result we wroteoff 166 million of debt issuance costs 

other income net other income net was 144 million and 74 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase was primarily due to increases in interest income and gains on foreign currency remeasurement 

provision for benefit from income taxes our benefit from income taxes was 8084 million for fiscal year 2018 compared to a provision for income taxes of 35 million for fiscal year 2017 the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the income tax benefits recognized from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and the redomiciliation transaction the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax and a discrete expense of 76 million resulting from entity reorganizations partially offset by the recognition of 273 million of excess tax benefits from stockbased equity awards that vested or were exercised during fiscal year 2017 and to a lesser extent the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits primarily as a result of audit settlements 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 

our primary sources of liquidity as of november 3 2019 consisted of i 5055 million in cash and cash equivalents ii cash we expect to generate from operations iii available capacity under our 5 billion revolving credit facility the “revolving 

facility” and iv available capacity under our 2 billion commercial paper program in addition we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time 

our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from i business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time ii working capital requirements iii research and development and capital expenditure needs iv cash dividend payments if and when declared by the board of directors v interest and principal payments related to outstanding indebtedness and vi payment of income taxes beginning april 2018 we settle withholding tax amounts due upon vesting of compensatory equity awards using cash on hand and withholding from the grant recipient that number of shares having a value equivalent to the withholding tax amount “tax shares” this net settlement method reduces the dilutive effects of such awards as they vest previously the tax shares were issued and mandatorily sold into the market and the cash proceeds were used to pay such withholding tax amounts this change results in an increased use of our cash as our outstanding equity awards vest our ability to fund these requirements will depend in part on our future cash flows which are determined by our future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 were lower than fiscal year 2018  due primarily to the completion of construction at our irvine and san jose campuses we expect capital expenditures to be higher in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 due to the symantec asset purchase on november 4 2019 

our debt and liquidity needs increased as a result of completing the symantec asset purchase we funded 107 billion of cash consideration needed for that transaction with debt financing 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operations and the revolving facility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months 

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction or evaluation of potential transactions could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities including acquisitions or unanticipated capital expenditures our business and financial condition could suffer in such circumstances we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing however we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to service our senior unsecured notes and outstanding term loans including those we borrowed to fund our acquisition of the symantec business and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above 

working capital 

working capital decreased to 3018 million at november 3 2019 from 6769 million at november 4 2018 the decrease was attributable to the following 

 these decreases in working capital were offset in part by the following 



working capital decreased to 6769 million at november 4 2018 from 13294 million at october 29 2017 the decrease was attributable to the following 

 these decreases in working capital were offset in part by the following 

 capital returns 

during fiscal year 2019  we repurchased and retired approximately 21 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 25852 under an 18 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by our board of directors during fiscal year 2018  we repurchased and retired approximately 32 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 22760 under this stock repurchase program this authorization ended on november 3 2019 



in addition during fiscal years 2019 and 2018  we paid approximately 972 million and 56 million  respectively in employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting of and related to net settled equity awards we withheld approximately 4 million and 02 million shares of common stock from employees in fiscal years 2019 and 2018  respectively in connection with such net share settlements 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the 817 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the adjustments to net income for noncash items and increases in working capital partially offset by the decrease in net income noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily included a decrease in benefits from deferred taxes and other noncash taxes and increases in amortization of intangible assets stockbased compensation and noncash restructuring impairment and disposal charges partially offset by a decrease in impairment of investment 

the 2329 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was due to the impact of net income partially offset by adjustments to net income for noncash items net income for fiscal year 2018 reflected an income tax benefit of 8084 million principally resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and the impact from the redomiciliation transaction and related internal reorganizations this benefit was primarily noncash resulting in a significant adjustment to net income and was included in the deferred taxes and other noncash taxes line in the consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal year 2018 other noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily included decreases in amortization of intangible assets and the noncash portion of the debt extinguishment loss partially offset by increases in stockbased compensation and impairment of investment 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures and investments partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and assets the 10748 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily related to 16027 million paid for the ca merger in fiscal year 2019 partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses as well as lower capital expenditures 

the 4000 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily related to 4780 million paid for the brocade merger in fiscal year 2018 partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses as well as lower capital expenditures 

financing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds and payments related to our longterm debt dividend and distribution payments stock repurchases and the issuances of common stock pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans the 17606 million increase in cash related to financing activities for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a 14207 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings net proceeds of 3679 million from issuance of preferred stock and a 1823 million decrease in common stock repurchases partially offset by a 1237 million increase in dividend and distribution payments and a 916 million increase in employee withholding taxes related to net share settled equity awards 

the 13348 million increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to 7258 million of stock repurchases an increase in dividend and distribution payments and the repayment of debt 

indebtedness 

see note 9  “ borrowings ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

contractual commitments 



debt principal interest and fees represents principal estimated interest and fees on borrowings for borrowings subject to a floating interest rate the estimated interest was based on the rate in effect during the last month of the fiscal year ended november 3 2019  

purchase commitments represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services primarily inventory that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with the internal fabrication facility expansion and construction of our new campuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and therefore cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above 

other contractual commitments represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to information technology human resources financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other service agreements 

operating lease obligations represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under noncancelable operating leases 

due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at november 3 2019  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 3269 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of november 3 2019 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements at november 3 2019 as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk under the exchange act

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency derivative instruments 

from time to time we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates which result from our global operating and financing activities gains and losses from foreign currency transactions as well as derivative instruments were not significant for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k as of november 3 2019  we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts 

european debt exposures 

we actively monitor our exposure to the european financial markets including the impact of sovereign debt issues we also seek to mitigate our risk by investing in fixed deposits with various financial institutions and we limit the amount we hold with any one institution we do not have any direct investments in the sovereign debt of european countries from time to time we may have deposits with major european financial institutions we also seek to mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition as of november 3 2019  we do not believe that we have any material direct or indirect exposure to the european financial markets 

interest rate risk 

at november 3 2019  we had 1600 million of outstanding term loans which are subject to floating interest rates a 1 change in the interest rate would affect interest expense on our term loans by approximately 16 million over the next 12 months

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade secrets and similar ip as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through security measures to protect our trade secrets we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 

as of november 4 2018  we had 20898  us and other patents and 1655  us and other pending patent applications our research and development efforts are presently resulting in approximately 100  new patent applications per year relating to a wide range of asic isolation encoder led rf and optoelectronic components enterprise storage products hdd silicon pcie usb and other standard io devices ethernet and fibrechannel connectivity and controllers settop box socs cable modem socs broadband access socs wireless connectivity socs switchingrouting socs high performance processor socs and associated applications the expiration dates of our patents range from 2019 to 2037  with a small number of patents expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 

we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 

we and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of ip licensing and crosslicensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors a portion of our revenue comes from ip licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to such ip we also license in thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities products and manufacturing processes historically licenses of the thirdparty technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty ip infringement claims claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us with respect to any ip rights claims against us or our customers or distributors we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product pay damages expend resources to develop noninfringing technology seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or relinquish patents or other ip rights

as of november 4 2018  we had approximately 15000 employees worldwide by geography approximately 55  of our employees are located in north america 38  in asia and 7  in europe the middle east and africa in the us none of our employees are represented by a labor union a small number of our employees in other countries is represented by workers councils or labor unions or are party to collective bargaining agreements 

environmental and other regulation 

our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health safety and the environment these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air water and soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we are also subject to regulation by the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 

we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements including legislation enacted in the us european union and china among a growing number of jurisdictions which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging these laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 

backlog 

our sales are generally made pursuant to shortterm purchase orders these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be and often are rescheduled canceled or modified on relatively short notice without substantial penalty therefore we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment this segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly in the wireless communications segment we have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification

risk factors 

tableend as noted above broadcom is the successor to broadcomsingapore following the redomiciliation transaction after the close of market trading on april 4 2018 broadcomsingapore became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of broadcom and we subsequently deregistered the partnership 

our business operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock the following important factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec press releases communications with investors and oral statements 

risks related to our business 

the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on a small number of end customers oems their respective contract manufacturers and certain distributors for a majority of our business revenue and results of operations for fiscal year s 2018  and 2017  sales to distributors accounted for 34  and 28  of our net revenue respectively direct sales to foxconn accounted for 9  and 14  of our net revenue for fiscal year s 2018  and 2017  respectively we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 40  of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2018  and 2017  we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 25 and more than 20  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant customers 

in addition our top customers’ purchasing power has in some cases given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and should we fail to comply with such terms might also result in substantial liability that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover the terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our customers generally do not include commitments by those customers to purchase any specific quantities of products from us even in those instances where we enter into an arrangement under which a customer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us provided that we are able to meet specified development supply and quality commitments the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect as a result we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements if we do not perform under these arrangements we could also be liable for significant monetary damages in addition we are selling an increasing amount of our products through a limited number of distributors which may expose us to additional customer concentration and related credit risks 

the loss of or any substantial reduction in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply   chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market damage our   reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes thirdparty wafer foundry and module assembly and test capabilities referred to as contract manufacturers our products require semiconductor wafer manufacturers with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer 

we depend on our contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis although we often have longterm contracts with our contract manufacturers we do not generally have longterm capacity commitments we obtain substantially all of our manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and our contract manufacturers have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product further from time to time our contract manufacturers will cease to or will become unable to manufacture a component for us as the lead time needed to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new contract manufacturer is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source for the wafers or other contract manufacturing services we require and there may be other constraints on our ability to change contract manufacturers in addition qualifying such contract manufacturers is often expensive and they may not produce products as costeffectively as our current suppliers which would reduce our margins in any such circumstances we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual 

obligations this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize tsmc to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers tsmc manufactured over threequarters of the wafers manufactured by our contract manufacturers during fiscal year  2018 our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice or raise their prices to us all of which could harm our business results of operations and gross margin 

any substantial disruption in tsmc’s supply of wafers to us or in the other contract manufacturing services that we utilize as a result of a natural disaster political unrest economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationships and results of operations 

we also depend on our contract manufacturers to timely develop new advanced manufacturing processes including in the case of wafer fabrication transitions to smaller geometry process technologies if these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or to deliver products to our customers which could result in loss of revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers 

we purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing processes rely on many materials including silicon gallium arsenide and indium phosphide wafers copper lead frames precious and rare earth metals mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials components and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers some of which are single source suppliers during the fiscal year  ended november 4 2018  we purchased approximately twothirds of the materials for our manufacturing processes from five materials providers substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis and we do not generally have longterm contracts with our materials providers suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases capacity constraints or other factors which may lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry in the event that we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials or at reasonable prices the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

failure to realize the benefits expected from the ca merger could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the completion of the ca merger is a key step in strategically developing our business from being predominately a semiconductor solutions provider to being a broadbased infrastructure technology provider focused on mission critical technology as part of this development we plan to change the ca business strategy to focus on renewing contracts for mission critical software with existing core clients and expanding the adoption of other existing ca offerings with these clients we believe our success with the ca business is dependent on this strategy if ca products are not as critical to customers as we believe or if ca customers do not accept this change in strategy such customers may elect not to renew their subscriptions for ca products and the investments we have made or may make to implement this strategy may be of no or limited value we may lose customers our financial results may be adversely affected and our stock price may suffer 

although we expect significant benefits to result from the ca merger there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully realize these benefits achieving these benefits will depend in part on our ability to integrate cas business successfully and efficiently the challenges involved in this integration which will be complex and time consuming include the following 



 if we do not successfully manage these and related issues and challenges we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the ca merger and our revenue expenses operating results financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected for example goodwill and other intangible assets could be determined to be impaired which could adversely impact our financial results the successful integration of the ca business and the implementation of changes in ca’s business strategy described above will require significant management attention and may divert management’s attention from our business and operational issues and opportunities 

we may pursue acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of and investment in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities or to consummate any such transactions in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction 

any acquisitions we may undertake involve risks and uncertainties such as unexpected delays challenges and related expenses and diversion of management’s attention if we fail to complete an acquisition our stock price could fall to the extent the price reflects an assumption that such acquisition will be completed and we may incur significant unrecoverable costs further the failure to consummate an acquisition may result in negative publicity and adversely impact our relationships with our customers vendors and employees we may become subject to legal proceedings relating to the acquisition and the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful the integration of an acquired business involves significant challenges including among others potential disruption of our business diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense assuming liabilities and ongoing lawsuits potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements and implementing our management information systems operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations in addition our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s products financial disclosures accounting practices legal tax and other contingencies compliance with local laws and regulations and interpretations thereof in multiple international jurisdictions as well as compliance with us laws and regulations these difficulties may be complicated by factors such as the size of the business or entity acquired geographic and cultural differences lack of experience operating in the industry or geographic markets of the acquired business potential loss of key employees and customers the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business performance problems with the acquired business’ technology exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition adverse tax consequences and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects or synergies expected from any such acquisition 

failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business operating results and margins 

any future acquisitions we make may require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing would be dilutive to our existing stockholders any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs as a result we may be unable to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past or at all these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability of acquired businesses or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business either acquired or otherwise or we may exit minority investments each of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations any future dispositions we may make could involve risks and uncertainties including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition any such dispositions could result in disruption to other parts of our business potential 

loss of employees or customers or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions for example in connection with such dispositions we often enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships including longterm research and development arrangements and sales arrangements or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition dispositions may include the transfer of technology andor the licensing of certain ip rights to thirdparty purchasers which could limit our ability to utilize such ip rights or assert these rights against such thirdparty purchasers or other third parties 

failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could adversely affect our   results of operations 

we make significant decisions including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept production schedules levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the shortterm nature of many customers’ commitments our customers’ ability to reschedule cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for our customers’ products as well as seasonal or cyclical trends in their industries or the semiconductor industry 

to ensure the availability of our products particularly for our largest customers we typically start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts which are not binding as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or that may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence because certain of our sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income 

conversely customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice we may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand this could damage our customer relationships reduce revenue growth and margins subject us to additional liabilities harm our reputation and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities 

we are subject to risks associated with our distributors including product inventory levels and   product sellthrough 

we sell many of our semiconductor products through distributors who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end customers sales to distributors accounted for 34  of our net revenue in fiscal year  2018 if our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any reason our sales to these distributors and our revenue may decline we also face the risk that our distributors may increase inventory levels of our products in any particular quarter in excess of future anticipated sales if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these distributors for any reason these distributors may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand which would harm our business and could adversely affect our revenue in such subsequent periods we have streamlined the number of distributors we use making us increasingly dependent on our remaining distributors which may exacerbate the foregoing risks and increase our related credit risk 

we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products as a result our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical devices and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications in such event failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 

our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team 

our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management team and in particular the services of mr hock e tan our president and chief executive officer effective succession planning is also important for our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 

our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 

our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 the foregoing factors are often difficult to predict and these as well as other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results in addition a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur which may happen immediately or over time 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our   engineering and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy   effectively 

our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel as well as effective sales professionals through acquisitions we may make from time to time or otherwise we have historically encountered some difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand in addition our employees including employees whom we have retained as a result of an acquisition may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little or no notice as the source of our technological and product innovations our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset we are making a multiyear equity award to most of our employees including ca employees many of whom were not eligible to receive equity awards prior to the ca merger this award is intended to approximate four consecutive annual grants that will vest in four tranches with successive fouryear vesting periods while we believe these awards provide a powerful longterm retention incentive to employees we may be incorrect in this assumption particularly if there is a material and persistent decline in the price of our stock any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 

a general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or a tightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business financial condition and liquidity adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate which have adversely affected our business and results of operations in recent periods investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected market and business conditions in general macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expenses and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions could cause our customers and consumers to reduce delay or forgo technology spending could lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers and could intensify pricing pressures any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand from time to time these factors together with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for enduser products high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable if we cannot offset industry or market downturns our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue 

our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes 

winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any a delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins occurring at the same time may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional unanticipated costs and expenses often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units from us until they qualify the products andor the manufacturing line for those products the qualification process can take significant time and resources and we may not always be able to satisfy customers’ qualification requirements delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue finally customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are 

exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 

competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements often aggressive pricing practices and in some cases new delivery methods we expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets 

in addition the competitive landscape is changing in these industries as a result of a trend toward consolidation some of our direct competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors we expect this consolidation trend to continue which may result in the combined competitors having greater manufacturing distribution financial research and development or marketing resources than us in addition some of our competitors may also have a greater presence in key markets a larger customer base or more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection than us 

we compete with integrated device manufacturers and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits or ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics as well as customers that may develop their own ic products our competitors in these markets range from large international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products and devices to smaller companies specializing in niche markets and new technologies 

our competitors also include large vendors of hardware and operating system software and cloud service providers some of our competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition a larger installed base of customers in any particular market larger technical staffs more established relationships with hardware vendors or greater financial technical and marketing resources than us we also face competition from numerous startups and smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry open source authors who may provide software and intellectual property for free competitors who may offer their products through tryandbuy or freemium models and customers who may develop competing products 

the actions of our competitors in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular could have a substantial adverse impact on us if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities research and development facilities or other significant operations or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse   effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes in order to protect our ip to accelerate time to market of our products and to ensure supply of certain components our fort collins and breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the film bulk acoustic resonator components used in many of our wireless devices and for the indium phosphidebased wafers used in our fibre optics products respectively many of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california and the pacific rim region which has above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition our research and development personnel are primarily concentrated in china czech republic india israel malaysia singapore south korea taiwan colorado california and pennsylvania with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas 

a prolonged disruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities for any reason especially our colorado singapore and pennsylvania facilities or those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness at one or more of these facilities would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose us to claims by our customers resulting in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this 

may in turn adversely affect our results of operations such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity at our own manufacturing facilities which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must maintain appropriate capacity at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand for our proprietary products from time to time this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities which often involves substantial cost and other risks such as delays in completion such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation forgo sales or lose customers as a result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities all of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

any failure of our it systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide   necessary services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on various it systems including networks applications internal it systems and personnel and outsourced services for among other things financial reporting and product orders and shipments we rely on thirdparty vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services on a timely and effective basis and to adequately address cybersecurity threats to their own systems services provided by these third parties include certain services related to shipping human resources benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us we may be unable to collect on any award of damages and any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs we may incur as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform under its agreement with us upon expiration or termination of any of our thirdparty vendor agreements we may not be able to timely replace the vendor on terms and conditions including service levels and costs which are favorable to us in addition a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete 

any failure of these internal or thirdparty systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand manage our supply chain and production facilities fulfill customer orders and report financial and other information on a timely and accurate basis 

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our product mix price erosion acquisitions we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity prices 

our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing nonproduct and iprelated revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages although our nonproduct revenue is generally high margin it fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternatives more complex engineering requirements lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin for us in the future 

our gross margin may also be adversely affected by expenses related to the acquisitions of businesses such as amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and impairment charges furthermore businesses or companies that we acquire may have different gross margin profiles than us and could therefore also affect our overall gross margin 

in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities such as depreciation expense will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin furthermore fluctuations in commodity prices either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy or as a result of price increases passed on to us by our suppliers could negatively impact our margins we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices some of which including gold and fuel prices are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 

we may be involved in legal proceedings including ip anticompetition and securities litigation employeerelated claims and governmental investigations which could among other things divert efforts of management and result in   significant expense and loss of our ip rights 

we are often involved in legal proceedings including cases involving our ip rights and those of others anticompetition and commercial matters acquisitionrelated suits securities class action suits employeerelated claims and other actions some of these actions may seek injunctive relief including injunctions or exclusion orders against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and 

results of operations from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in governmental investigations or inquiries such as the recent inquiries by the us federal trade commission and the european commission into certain of our business practices litigation or settlement of such actions regardless of their merit or involvement in governmental investigations can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time can divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel and is frequently costly with the related expenditures unpredictable an unfavorable resolution of a governmental investigation may include among others fines or other orders to disgorge profits or make other payments andor the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct andor modify our business practices any or all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations 

the semiconductor and software industries are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including actions by patentholding companies that do not make or sell products from time to time third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent copyright trademark trade secret and other ip rights to technologies that are important to our business 

many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for thirdparty ip infringement claims including costs to defend those claims and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in ip litigation if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could be required to 

 any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigations these liabilities could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals as well as stockholder derivative suits the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed 

we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business if we are   unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely   affected 

our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights including the usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect the ip rights that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that 



 in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the us and may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions we may elect to abandon or divest patents or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications due to strategic concerns or other factors in addition when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 

we also generate some of our revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip rights particularly exclusive licenses may limit our ability to assert those ip rights against third parties including the licensee of those rights in addition we may acquire companies with ip that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties these licensing obligations may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip rights from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights including in some cases against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships such as customers and suppliers claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us conversely third parties may pursue ip litigation against us including as a result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our ip against others in addition such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 

if our software products do not remain compatible with everchanging operating environments platforms or thirdparty products demand for our products and services could decrease which could materially adversely affect our business 

the largest suppliers of systems and computing software are in most cases the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers particularly in the mainframe space these companies periodically modify or introduce new operating systems systems software and computer hardware which could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies’ hardware or software there can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments 

further our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties if we lose access to thirdparty code and specifications for the development of code this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software in addition if software providers and hardware manufacturers including some of our largest vendors adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code or technical documentation for their operating systems applications or hardware or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development of new products any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business 

many of our existing customers have multiyear enterprise license agreements some of which involve substantial aggregate fee amounts these customers have no contractual obligation to purchase additional solutions customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the level of customer satisfaction with our solutions or customer support customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors any of which may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected if at all the failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope on terms that are commercially attractive to us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow 

our sales to government clients subject us to uncertainties regarding fiscal funding approvals renegotiations or terminations at the discretion of the government as well as audits and investigations which could result in litigation penalties and sanctions including early termination suspension and debarment 

our multiyear contracts signed with the us federal government and other us state and local government agencies are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the government termination renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales revenue and reputation additionally our government contracts are generally subject to certain requirements some of which are generally not present in commercial contracts andor may be complex as well as to audits and investigations failure to meet contractual requirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future which may delay product development and production or cause us to incur additional expense 

some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive the loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products 

certain software we use is from open source code sources which under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flow 

some of our products contain software from open source code sources the use of which may subject us to certain conditions including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available further although some open source vendors provide warranty and support agreements it is common for such software to be available “asis” with no warranty indemnity or support although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions such use under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results and cash flow including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may in the future lead to significant expense our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters for example it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 

highly complex products such as those we offer may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions software documentation or enhancements are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development if any of our products including the products of companies we have acquired or thirdparty components used in our products contain defects or bugs or have reliability quality or compatibility problems we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercial production of or deployed a new product we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall repair or replacement costs significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a 

number of third party software applications and databases as a result if there is systemwide failure it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product consequently our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to resolve these problems we may have to invest significant capital and other resources these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others for example if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s endproduct delivery we may be required under the terms of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays in addition these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and we would likely lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected product or products as a result our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

we make substantial investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new technologies to keep pace with technological advances and to remain competitive in our business and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements short product cycles and evolving industry standards new delivery methods and require substantial investment in our research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products in addition semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries this requires us to adapt our products and manufacturing processes to these new technologies which requires expertise in new procedures our failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development we expect the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our products may be reduced significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely   affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we   conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 

a majority of our products are produced and sourced internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of our overall revenue in addition as of november 4 2018  approximately 46 of our employees are located outside the us multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 



a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations including anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws moneylaundering regulations and export regulations in addition the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may in some cases conflict with each other although our code of ethics and business conduct and other policies prohibit us our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anticorruption policies and procedures any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with   these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain   compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease   the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to civil or criminal   penalties 

our business is subject to various international laws and other legal requirements including packaging product content labor and importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and many of our semiconductor products are regulated or sold into regulated industries these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have generally become more stringent over time and may intensify under the current us administration we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations 

in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur for example if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt crossborder manufacturing relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to comply with these requirements we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution in addition it is expected that the current us administration’s trade policy will promote us manufacturing and manufacturers it is unclear what effect this will have on us as a multinational company that conducts business worldwide or on our suppliers customers contract manufacturers and oems 

our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations our business could be harmed 

data privacy regulations are expanding and compliance with and any violations of these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses 

privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment the cost of complying with and implementing these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and substantial fines and damages the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws which could increase our   costs restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material   adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of international laws and regulations relating to the use disposal cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could among other things require us to modify our manufacturing processes restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in various countries including the us china japan and in the european union increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to reengineer our products such reengineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may also experience claims from 

employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims 

social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers 

there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions an increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the un global compact a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop implement and disclose sustainability policies and practices these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply with such policies or provisions a customer may stop purchasing products from us and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

in addition as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products since our supply chain is complex we are not currently able to definitively ascertain the origins of all of the minerals and metals used in our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

the average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased   rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross   profit 

the semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications as a result the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by among other things pricing pressures from our customers in the past we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors in addition some of our customer agreements provide for volumebased pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes reducing manufacturing costs or developing new and higher valueadded products on a timely basis 

a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers’ suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information as well as our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on a number of thirdparty cloudbased and other service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to among other things human resources electronic communication services and certain finance functions and we are out of necessity dependent on the security systems of these providers 

accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties or our employees or contractors of our facilities our information systems or the systems of our cloudbased or other service providers or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees in addition we have from time to time also been subject to unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own it networks although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on us and our customers 

certain of our software products are intended to manage and secure it infrastructures and environments and as a result we expect these products to be ongoing targets of cybersecurity attacks open source code or other thirdparty software used in our infrastructure and products could also be targeted additionally we use thirdparty data centers including for part of our saas business that may also be subject to hacking incidents although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on us and our customers cybersecurity attacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources additionally efforts by hackers or others could cause interruptions delays or cessation of our product licensing or modification of our software 

which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers a successful cybersecurity attack involving our products and it infrastructure could also negatively impact the market perception of their effectiveness 

any theft or misuse of confidential personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in among other things unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information difficulty in marketing our products allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business profitability and financial condition since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual   basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of   investor confidence in our financial reports significant expense to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act even though as of november 4 2018  we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes including to reflect our integration of ca as well as any future acquisitions we may undertake this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive time consuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as we grow our business or acquire other businesses our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls either in our existing business or in businesses that we acquire could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remedy any material weakness our financial statements may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statements our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital markets may be restricted the trading price of our common stock may decline and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities including the sec or the nasdaq global select market 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses 

we operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars however some of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar could result in substantial changes in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into us dollars 

in the normal course of business we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks including the use of derivative instruments these strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions for example the tax cuts and jobs act or the 2017 tax reform act adopting broad us corporate income tax reform will among other things reduce the us corporate income tax rate but will impose baseerosion prevention measures on earnings of nonus subsidiaries of us entities as well as the transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated nonus earnings of us controlled foreign corporations there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 

in addition many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations 

and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transfer pricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and   other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable in part or in whole for any reason or if our   assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday   arrangements prove to be incorrect the amount of corporate income taxes we have to   pay could significantly increase 

our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example one of the tax incentives from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore provides that any qualifying income we earn in singapore is subject to a tax incentive or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments this singapore tax incentive is presently expected to expire in fiscal year 2020 subject in certain cases to potential extensions which we may or may not be able to obtain and any subsequent changes in incentive scope absent this tax incentive the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our singapore taxable income would be 17 we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 the tax incentives and tax holiday that we have obtained are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may in some instances be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present arrangements the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately 590 million  and increase diluted net income per share by 137  for fiscal year 2018  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday in the aggregate was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately 237 million and 169 million  respectively increase diluted net income per share by 056  for fiscal year 2017  and reduce diluted net loss per share by 044  for fiscal year 2016  

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 

our overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors including reorganizations or restructurings of our businesses or assets jurisdictional revenue mix and changes in tax regulations or policy and may be further impacted by the redomiciliation transaction all of which could materially adversely affect financial results 

we are a multinational company subject to tax in various tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including 



 we have also adopted transfer pricing policies between our affiliated entities our policies call for the provision of services the sale of products the advance of financing and grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of comprehensive treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful result in adjustments for prior or future years as a result of these adjustments we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings and results of operations would be adversely affected in any period in which such determination is made 

although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liabilities prescribed in the relevant accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions which if resolved unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes and our payment obligation with respect to any such taxes 

in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

the redomiciliation transaction will likely increase our cash tax cost 

as a result of the redomiciliation transaction and the effects of the 2017 tax reform act we expect our cash tax costs and overall effective cash tax rate will increase there is still significant uncertainty as to how the 2017 tax reform act will be implemented and as a result our estimates of the overall cash tax impact of the redomiciliation transaction are expected to change as we continue to refine our analysis and as additional guidance becomes available there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liabilities prescribed in the relevant accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 

the internal revenue service may not agree that prior to the redomiciliation transaction broadcomsingapore should have been treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

although broadcomsingapore is a singapore entity the internal revenue service or irs may assert that following our acquisition of brcm broadcomsingapore should have been treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code if the irs were to determine that under section 7874 of the code the former shareholders of brcm held at least 60 of the vote or value of the ordinary shares of broadcomsingapore immediately after our acquisition of brcm such percentage referred to as the “section 7874 percentage” broadcomsingapore would be treated as a “surrogate foreign corporation” and several limitations could then apply to brcm for example brcm would be prohibited from using its net operating losses foreign tax credits or other tax attributes to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following our acquisition of brcm or any income received or accrued during such period by reason of a license of any property by brcm to a foreign related person moreover in such case section 4985 of the code and rules related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectly by certain brcm “disqualified individuals” including former officers and directors of brcm at a rate equal to 15 but only if a gain is otherwise recognized by brcm former shareholders as a result of our acquisition of brcm if the irs were to determine the section 7874 percentage was 80 or more then broadcomsingapore would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

while we believe the section 7874 percentage was significantly less than 60 determining the section 7874 percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our position 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions could limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and exposes us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

as of november 4 2018  our total consolidated indebtedness under our senior unsecured notes that were issued and sold in january 2017 and october 2017 collectively the 2017 senior notes was 17550 million  subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2018 we borrowed 18 billion in term loans to finance the ca merger or the 2019 term loans and we assumed 225 billion of ca’s outstanding senior unsecured notes we expect to maintain heightened levels of indebtedness going forward in part due to our ongoing dividend and stock buyback programs 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 in addition our variable rate indebtedness may use libor as a benchmark for establishing the rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the us factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies while we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from these agencies we may be unable to do so any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets could 

 the instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business 

the indentures governing the 2017 senior notes contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business to plan for or react to changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the restrictions placed on us include limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the indentures contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the noteholders would have the ability to immediately declare the debt due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures 

selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed which could result in a default on our indebtedness 

risks relating to owning our common stock 

at times our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the   future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

the trading price of our common stock has at times fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and others including 

 these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or currency fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future we are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions securities litigation against us including the lawsuits related to such transactions could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate 

while we expect to continue to allocate a substantial amount of our free cash flow to stock repurchases the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes these purposes include operational spending capital spending acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments changes in cash flows tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program 

a substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock in the public market by one or more of these holders could cause our stock price to fall 

as of september 30 2018 we believe 12 of our 20 largest stockholders were active institutional investors who held approximately 34 of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate with capital world investors being our largest stockholder with approximately 10 of our outstanding shares of common stock these investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our common stock in addition any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors management’s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions earnings levels contractual restrictions our stock repurchase program cash position and overall financial condition and changes to our business model the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law contractual restrictions and our corporate structure because we are a holding 

company our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries 

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 

from time to time we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release this guidance which consists of forwardlooking statements is prepared by our management and is qualified by and subject to the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles examines or reviews the guidance and accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 

guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity is inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of these ranges the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies as our management will necessarily be less familiar with their business procedures and operations accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data are forecast in light of the foregoing investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance and such differences may be adverse and material

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the caption “risk factors” or in other parts of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

broadcom inc or broadcom is a global technology leader that designs develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions 

we develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog iiiv based products we have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment smartphones and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays through our fiscal year ended november 4 2018 or fiscal year 2018 we had four reportable segments wired infrastructure wireless communications enterprise storage and industrial  other 

original equipment manufacturers or oems or their contract manufacturers and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems we also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors 

the demand for our semiconductor products has been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factors including the following 

 uncertainty in global economic conditions pose significant risks to our business for example customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news which would in turn adversely affect product demand and our results of operations 

our fiscal year 2018 was a 53week fiscal year compared to our fiscal year ended october 29 2017 or fiscal year 2017 and our fiscal year ended october 30 2016 or fiscal year 2016 which were 52week fiscal years the additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 resulted in higher net revenue gross margin dollars research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods 

fiscal year highlights 

highlights during fiscal year 2018  include the following 



 redomiciliation to the united states from singapore 

as part of the plan to cause the publicly traded parent company of the broadcom group of companies to be a delaware corporation after the close of market trading on april 4 2018 broadcom and broadcom limited or broadcomsingapore completed a statutory scheme of arrangement under singapore law pursuant to which all broadcomsingapore outstanding ordinary shares were exchanged on a oneforone basis for newly issued shares of broadcom common stock and broadcomsingapore became an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of broadcom this transaction is referred to as the redomiciliation transaction 

the financial information and results of operations in this form 10k for periods prior to april 4 2018 relate to our predecessors broadcomsingapore and avago technologies limited for accounting and financial reporting purposes and relate to broadcom for periods after april 4 2018 the effective date of the redomiciliation transaction 

in conjunction with the redomiciliation transaction all outstanding exchangeable limited partnership units or lp units of broadcom cayman lp or the partnership a subsidiary of broadcomsingapore were mandatorily exchanged on a oneforone basis for newly issued shares of broadcom common stock as a result all the limited partners became common stockholders of broadcom and broadcomsingapore redeemed all related outstanding special preference shares consequently the limited partners no longer hold a noncontrolling interest in the partnership and we subsequently deregistered the partnership 

recent developments 

acquisition of ca inc 

on november 5 2018  or the ca merger date we acquired ca inc or ca for approximately 188 billion  in aggregate cash purchase consideration in exchange for all shares of ca common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing and assumed 225 billion of outstanding unsecured bonds or the ca merger in addition we assumed all unvested ca stock options outstanding restricted stock awards restricted stock units or rsus and performance stock units held by continuing employees all vested inthemoney ca stock options and director stock units were cashed out upon the completion of the ca merger we financed the ca merger with 18 billion from borrowings under a term a facility entered into on the ca merger date as well as cash on hand of the combined companies see note 16  “ subsequent events ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further detail 

we expect our reporting segments to change beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as a result of the ca merger that closed on november 5 2018 the first day of our fiscal year 2019 

in connection with the ca merger we entered into a definitive agreement to sell veracode inc a wholly owned subsidiary of ca and provider of application security testing solutions to thoma bravo llc for cash consideration of 950 million 

the discussions below related to our business reporting segments and financial results for fiscal year 2018 and prior periods do not include any impact from or information relating to the ca merger 

acquisitions and divestitures 

the discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 

acquisition of brocade communications systems inc 

on november 17 2017 we acquired brocade or the brocade merger for approximately 53 billion  in cash in exchange for all shares of brocade common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the brocade merger and paid 701 million  to retire brocade’s term loan in addition we assumed all unvested brocade stock options rsus and performance stock units held by continuing employees all vested inthemoney brocade stock options after giving effect to any acceleration were cashed out upon the brocade merger 

we financed the brocade merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes issued during october 2017 or the october 2017 senior notes as well as cash on hand see note 8  “ borrowings ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further detail 

following the brocade merger on december 1 2017 we sold brocade’s internet protocol networking business including the ruckus wireless and icx switch businesses to arris international plc for cash consideration of 800 million  before contractual working capital adjustments 

acquisition of broadcom corporation 

on february 1 2016 broadcom became the successor to avago technologies limited or avago and acquired broadcom corporation or brcm in which avago shareholders exchanged their shares on a oneforone basis for newly issued broadcom shares or the broadcom merger brcm shareholders received in aggregate approximately 168 billion  in cash 112 million  broadcom shares and 23 million  partnership units in exchange for all shares of brcm common stock par value 00001 per share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the broadcom merger in addition we also paid 137 million  in cash for vested brcm equity awards broadcom also assumed unvested rsus originally granted by brcm and converted them into 6 million  broadcom rsus 

the aggregate consideration for the broadcom merger was approximately 357 billion  we funded the cash portion of the broadcom merger with net proceeds from the issuance of 156 billion in term loans under a guaranteed collateralized credit agreement or the 2016 credit agreement that we entered into at the time of closing of the broadcom merger as well as cash on hand of the combined companies 

during fiscal year 2016 we completed the sales of certain noncore brcm businesses for aggregate cash proceeds of 830 million and recognized an aggregate gain of 36 million from the sales 

net revenue 

substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products as well as from modules switches and subsystems we have four reportable segments wired infrastructure wireless communications enterprise storage and industrial  other which align with our target markets 

our overall net revenue as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments has varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuations in endmarket demand including the effects of seasonality which are discussed in detail below under “seasonality” 

oems or their contract manufacturers and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales we sell products directly to oems and other end customers many of whom also purchase products from our distributors and who direct contract manufacturers to purchase products from us we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems distributors also account for a significant portion of our business and we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 

costs and expenses 

total cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations which include stockbased compensation expense related occupancy computer services equipment costs manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty adjustments inventory adjustments including writedowns for inventory obsolescence and acquisition costs which include direct transaction costs and integrationrelated costs total costs of products sold also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges 

although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies including stockbased compensation expense these expenses also include project material costs thirdparty fees paid to consultants prototype development expense allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 

selling  general and administrative selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel including stockbased compensation expense sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives advertising costs trade shows corporate marketing promotion travel related to our sales and marketing operations related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management finance human resources and other 

administrative personnel including stockbased compensation expense outside professional fees allocated facilities costs acquisitionrelated costs and other corporate expenses 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions we recognize intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year  to 25 years  we also recognize goodwill which is not amortized and inprocess research and development or iprd which is initially capitalized as an indefinitelived intangible asset in connection with acquisitions upon completion of each underlying project iprd assets are reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over their estimated useful lives 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges restructuring impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs alignment of our global manufacturing operations rationalizing product development program costs inprocess research and development impairment fixed asset impairment facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs including curtailment of service or supply agreements 

interest expense interest expense includes coupon interest commitment fees accretion of original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs and expenses related to debt modification 

other income net other income net includes interest income gains losses on foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 

provision for income taxes the 2017 tax reform act made significant changes to the us internal revenue code including 1 a decrease in the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 2 the accrual of us income tax on foreign earnings when earned allowing certain foreign dividends to then be taxexempt rather than deferring such income tax payments until the foreign earnings are repatriated into the us and 3 the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated nonus earnings of us controlled foreign corporations or the transition tax following the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act the securities and exchange commission or sec issued guidance for situations when there is insufficient information to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax reform act based on our interpretation of the 2017 tax reform act and the sec’s guidance we recognized an income tax benefit of 7278 million  during fiscal year 2018 we also recognized an income tax benefit of 1162 million  primarily as a result of the redomiciliation transaction 

we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment one of the tax incentives from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore provides that any qualifying income earned in singapore is subject to a tax incentive or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in this incentive and legislative developments this singapore tax incentive is presently expected to expire in fiscal year 2020 subject in certain cases to potential extensions which we may or may not be able to obtain absent this tax incentive the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17  we also have a tax holiday on our qualifying income in malaysia which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028 

the tax incentives and tax holiday that we have obtained are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements for fiscal year 2018  the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately 590 million  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately 237 million  and 169 million  respectively 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and 

various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies include revenue recognition business combinations valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill inventory valuation income taxes retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions stockbased compensation and employee bonus programs see note 2  “ summary of significant accounting policies ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates however because of the inherent nature of estimates there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results we also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue 100 of potential rebates at the time of sale we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 

certain of our product sales are sold in multipleelement arrangements including networking hardware with embedded software products and support which are considered separate units of accounting for certain of our products software and nonsoftware components function together to deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality 

we allocate revenue to each element in a multipleelement arrangement based upon the relative selling price when applying the relative selling price method we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe of selling price if it exists or thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element revenue related to support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period 

we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range for support we consider stated renewal rates in determining vsoe 

in most instances we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements when vsoe cannot be established we attempt to establish the selling price for each element based on tpe when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe we use best estimated selling price or besp in our allocation of the arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 

we determine besp for a product by considering multiple factors including but not limited to geographies market conditions competitive landscape internal costs gross margin objectives and pricing practices taking into consideration our gotomarket strategy 

business combinations   accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed restructuring liabilities preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on histor ical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is morelikelythannot 

that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances considers various macroeconomic industryspecific and companyspecific factors those factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends ii significant companyspecific actions including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of events and circumstances if we determine that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses and taxes as well as working capital and capital asset requirements these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows the market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash and debt 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including purchased inprocess research and development assets property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trends the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business that the longlived asset relates to we also consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the longlived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand additionally our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 

income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances if we determine that a valuation allowance is required such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made conversely if we determine that a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing 

positions we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the morelikelythannot threshold for recognition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes interest and penalties will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed a further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to us based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap one critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs other important assumptions include the expected longterm return on plan assets expected future salary increases the health care cost trend rate expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates — november 4 2018  and october 29 2017  for both us and nonus plans in fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively the us discount rates are based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields the discount rate for nonus plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yields depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense 

the u s expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fullymatched liabilitydriven investment strategy 

actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating us pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of november 4 2018  each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated 33 million impact on the benefit obligations as of november 4 2018  each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption and expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated change of 1 million and 3 million respectively on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2019  

stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense consists of expense for stock options and rsus granted to employees and nonemployees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with broadcom employee stock purchase plan or espp we recognize compensation expense for timebased stock options and espp rights based on the estimated grantdate fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the blackscholes valuation model 

 certain equity awards include both timebased and marketbased conditions and are accounted for as marketbased awards the fair value of these marketbased awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model 

employee bonus programs our employee bonus programs which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics in the first fiscal quarter of the year if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated a variable proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100 achievement of the targets and metrics the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100 and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved in subsequent quarters we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter

results of operations 

fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017 



net revenue 

historically a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue sales to distributors accounted for 34  and 28  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively during fiscal year 2018 no  direct customer represented more than 10 of our net revenue direct sales to foxconn technology group companies including hon hai precision industries accounted for 14  of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017  we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 40  of our net revenue for each of fiscal years 2018  and 2017  we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for approximately 25  of our net revenue for fiscal year 2018  and more than 20  for fiscal year 2017  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time some of our key customers place large orders or delay orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true in our wireless communications segment as fluctuations may be magnified by the launches of and seasonal variations in sales of mobile handsets 

in recent years approximately 50 of our net revenue has come from sales to distributors oems or contract manufacturers located in china however the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated are frequently located in countries other than china as a result we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product to end customers located in china 

the following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented 





our total net revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of brocade in fiscal year 2018  as well as strong organic yearoveryear growth 

net revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased slightly primarily due to an increase in demand for our networking applicationspecific integrated circuit or asic products that was largely offset by a decrease in demand for our set top box and optical products net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets and a later than typical new handset ramp with a major customer which resulted in product shipments that typically would have occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 occurring in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to contributions from the brocade fibre channel storage area network or fc san business net revenue from our industrial  other segment increased primarily due to an increase in demand for our industrial products 

gross margin 

gross margin was 10733 million  for fiscal year 2018  compared to 8509 million  for fiscal year 2017 gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 52  in fiscal year 2018  from 48  for fiscal year 2017  the fiscal year 2018 increases were primarily due to the addition of brocade products as well as a more favorable product mix partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets we expect to incur additional amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in future periods as a result of the ca merger and any further acquisitions we may make 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 476 million  or 14  in fiscal year 2018  research and development expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenue at 18  and 19  for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in research and development expense dollars for fiscal year 2018  was primarily due to the acquisition of brocade higher stockbased compensation expense and higher variable employee compensation expense due to fiscal year 2018 operating performance stockbased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2018  primarily due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values we expect to incur additional research and development expense in future periods as a result of the ca merger and any future acquisitions we may make 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 269 million  or 34  in fiscal year 2018  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat at 5  and 4  for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in selling general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2018  was primarily due to the acquisition of brocade and associated acquisitionrelated costs as well as higher stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2018  primarily due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased 1223 million  or 69  in fiscal year 2018  the decrease was primarily due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the broadcom merger partially offset by the addition of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the brocade merger we expect to report additional amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in future periods as a result of the ca merger and any further acquisitions we may make 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses increased 58 million  or 36  in fiscal year 2018  the increase was primarily due to   an increase in restructuring activities resulting from the brocade merger partially offset by a decrease in brcm restructuring activities we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of the ca merger and any further acquisitions we may make 

litigation settlements 

during fiscal years 2018  and 2017  we incurred 14 million  and 122 million  of litigation charges respectively associated with certain legal settlement agreements 

segment operating results 



operating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to an increase in demand for our networking asic products primarily offset by a decrease in demand for our settop box and optical products operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets as well as a later than typical new handset ramp with a major customer which resulted in higher shipments in fiscal year 2018 operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to contributions from the brocade fc san business products operating income from our industrial  other segment increased primarily due to increases in demand for our industrial products 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets stockbased compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charges acquisitionrelated costs charges for litigation settlements and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses decreased 6  in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to decreases in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and charges for litigation settlements substantially offset by increases in stockbased compensation expense acquisitionrelated costs purchase accounting effect on inventory and restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense   interest expense was 628 million  and 454 million  for fiscal years 2018  and 2017  respectively interest expense was higher in fiscal year 2018 primarily due to the issuance of our october 2017 senior notes as well as debt commitment fees paid in connection with the brocade merger we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal year 2019 associated with term loan indebtedness we incurred to finance the ca merger 

impairment on investment   we recognized 106 million  in fiscal year 2018 for an other than temporary impairment of one of our cost method investments 

loss on extinguishment of debt   loss on extinguishment of debt was 166 million  for fiscal year 2017 we issued senior unsecured notes in january 2017 or january 2017 senior notes to repay all of the term loans outstanding under our guaranteed collateralized credit agreement dated february 1 2016 as a result we wroteoff 166 million  of debt issuance costs 

other income net other income net includes interest income gains losses on foreign currency remeasurement and 

other miscellaneous items other income net was 144 million  and 62 million  in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase was primarily due to increases in interest income and gains on foreign currency remeasurement 

provision for income taxes   our benefit from income taxes was 8084 million  for fiscal year 2018 compared to a provision for income taxes of 35 million  for fiscal year 2017 the benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the income tax benefits recognized from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and the redomiciliation transaction the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax and a discrete expense of 76 million  resulting from entity reorganizations partially offset by the recognition of 273 million  of excess tax benefits from stockbased equity awards that vested or were exercised during fiscal year 2017 and to a lesser extent the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits primarily as a result of audit settlements 

fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016   



net revenue 





our total net revenue increased primarily due to the full year contribution from acquired brcm products in fiscal year 2017  compared to only three quarters in fiscal year 2016  as well as due to strong organic yearoveryear growth 

net revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to the full year contribution from acquired brcm products as well as strong organic yearoveryear growth net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets as well as the full year contribution from acquired brcm products net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to strength in demand for our hard disk drive or hdd products   as well as increased demand for our custom solid state drive or ssd controller and server storage and connectivity products the demand for our hdd products was higher in fiscal year 2017 than in fiscal year 2016 due to shortages in the ssd supply chain during fiscal year 2017 

gross margin   

gross margin increased by 2569 million  in fiscal year 2017  gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 48  in fiscal year 2017  from 45  for fiscal year 2016  these increases were primarily attributable to a 1181 million  reduction in acquisition purchase accounting effect on inventory as well as a more favorable product mix partially offset by a 1748 million  increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets resulting from the broadcom merger the 33  increase in net revenue was the primary reason for the increase in gross margin dollars 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 618 million  or 23  in fiscal year 2017  research and development expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenue at 19  and 20  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in research and development expense dollars for fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to a full year of expense resulting from the acquired brcm businesses and higher stockbased compensation expense partially offset by benefits from restructuring actions that we initiated following the broadcom merger stockbased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2017  due to equity awards granted to employees from the acquired brcm businesses as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense decreased 19 million  or 2  in fiscal year 2017  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 4  and 6  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in selling general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs   and benefits from restructuring actions that we initiated following the broadcom merger partially offset by higher stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2017  due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased 109 million  or 6  in fiscal year 2017  due to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets acquired in the broadcom merger 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses decreased 835 million  or 84  in fiscal year 2017  primarily due to a decrease in the impairment of inprocess research and development projects  the decrease was also due to lower employee termination costs as the majority of restructuring activities resulting from the broadcom merger were undertaken in fiscal year 2016 

litigation settlements 

during fiscal year 2017 we incurred 122 million  of litigation charges associated with certain legal settlement agreements 

segment operating results 



operating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to a full year of revenue contributions from acquired brcm products as well as strong organic yearoveryear growth partially offset by a full year of research and development expense related to the acquired brcm businesses operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets as well as the full year contribution from acquired brcm products these increases were partially offset by a full year of research and development expense related to the acquired brcm businesses operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to strength in demand for our hdd products as well as increased demand for our custom ssd controller and server storage connectivity products operating income for the wired infrastructure wireless communications and enterprise storage segments also benefited from lower operating expenses following our restructuring actions operating income from our industrial  other segment increased primarily due to an increase in revenue dollars from our optocoupler products and licensing of intellectual property or ip partially offset by an increase in legal expense 

unallocated expenses decreased 1  in fiscal year 2017  primarily due to significant reductions in the purchase accounting effect on inventory and restructuring impairment and disposal charges partially offset by increases in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and charges for litigation settlements additionally stockbased compensation was higher in fiscal year 2017  due to equity awards granted to employees from the acquired brcm businesses as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense  interest expense was 454 million  and 585 million  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively interest expense was higher in fiscal year 2016 due primarily to onetime debtrelated expenses associated with the financing of the broadcom merger 

loss on extinguishment of debt   during january 2017  we issued senior unsecured notes to refinance all of the term loans outstanding under the 2016 credit agreement we terminated the 2016 credit agreement and the revolving credit facility thereunder in connection with the issuance of the october 2017 senior notes the proceeds of which were used to finance the brocade merger as a result we wrote off 166 million  of outstanding debt issuance costs which were included in loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2016  we made prepayments on our term loan borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement and as a result recognized 123 million  of losses on extinguishment of debt 

other income net other income net was 62 million  and 10 million  in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively other income net for fiscal year 2017  was primarily comprised of a gain on disposal of assets and interest income 

provision for income taxes   our provisions for income taxes were 35 million  and 642 million  in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax and a discrete expense of 76 million  resulting from entity reorganizations partially offset by the recognition of 273 million  of excess tax benefits from stockbased equity awards that vested or were exercised during fiscal year 2017  and to a lesser extent the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits primarily as a result of audit settlements 

the income tax provision for fiscal year 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in tax associated with our undistributed earnings partially offset by income tax benefits from losses from continuing operations and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment this segment has historically experienced seasonality due to 

launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly in the wireless communications segment we have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of this diversification 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 

our primary sources of liquidity as of november 4 2018  consisted of i 4292 million  in cash and cash equivalents and ii cash we expect to generate from operations in addition we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt financing from time to time 

our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from i business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time ii working capital requirements iii research and development and capital expenditure needs iv stock repurchases if any v cash dividend payments if and when declared by the board of directors vi interest and principal payments related to outstanding indebtedness and vii payment of income taxes including taxes resulting from intercompany transfers of ip beginning april 2018 we settle withholding tax amounts due upon vesting of compensatory equity awards using cash on hand and withhold from the grant recipient that number of shares having a value equivalent to the withholding tax amount referred to as the tax shares this net settlement method reduces the dilutive effects of such awards as they vest previously the tax shares were issued and mandatorily sold into the market and the cash proceeds were used to pay such withholding tax amounts this change results in an increased use of our cash particularly in the second quarter of each fiscal year when the majority of our outstanding equity awards vest our ability to fund these requirements will depend in part on our future cash flows which are determined by our future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018  were lower than fiscal year 2017  due primarily to completion of construction at our irvine and san jose campuses we expect capital expenditures to be lower in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  

our debt and liquidity needs increased as a result of completing the ca merger we funded 188 billion  of cash consideration needed for that transaction with debt financing as well as cash on hand of the combined companies 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows from operations and the revolving credit facility that we established in connection with the debt funding of the ca merger will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months 

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction or evaluation of potential transactions could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities including acquisitions or unanticipated capital expenditures our business and financial condition could suffer in such circumstances we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing however we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to service our senior unsecured notes the term loan a facilities we entered into to fund the ca merger and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above 

working capital 

working capital decreased to 6769 million at november 4 2018 from 13294 million at october 29 2017 the decrease was attributable to the following 



 these decreases in working capital were offset in part by the following 

 working capital increased to 13294 million  at october 29 2017 from 4047 million  at october 30 2016 the increase was attributable to the following 



capital returns 

in april 2018 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 12 billion of our common stock from time to time on or prior to november 3 2019 the end of our fiscal year 2019 during fiscal year 2018  we repurchased and retired approximately 32 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 22760  under this stock repurchase program as of november 4 2018  4742 million  of the current authorization remained available under our stock repurchase program on december 5 2018 subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2018 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 6 billion  of our common stock on or prior to the end of our fiscal year 2019 

repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be effected through a variety of methods including open market or privately negotiated purchases the timing and number of shares of common stock repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and alternative investment opportunities we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares of common stock and we may suspend or discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time 



cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income loss adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the 2329 million  increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to the impact of net income partially offset by adjustments to net income for noncash items net income for fiscal year 2018  reflected an income tax benefit of 8084 million  principally resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax reform act and the impact from the redomiciliation transaction and related internal reorganizations this benefit was primarily noncash resulting in a significant adjustment to net income and was included in the deferred taxes and other noncash taxes line in the consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal year 2018  other noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal year 2018  as compared to fiscal year 2017  primarily included decreases in amortization of intangible assets and the noncash portion of the debt extinguishment loss partially offset by increases in stockbased compensation and impairment of investment 

the 3140 million  increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was due to the impact of net income and adjustments to net income for noncash items partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities the noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal year 2017  as compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily included increases in amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation partially offset by decreases in noncash restructuring impairment and disposal charges and deferred taxes and other noncash taxes 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions capital expenditures and investments partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and assets the 4000 million  increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily related to 4780 million paid for the brocade merger in fiscal year 2018 partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses as well as lower capital expenditures 

the 9166 million  decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to 10055 million paid primarily for the broadcom merger in fiscal year 2016 and cash receipts of 441 million from the sale of our irvine campus in fiscal year 2017 partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of businesses and an increase in capital expenditures and investments 

financing activities 

cash provided by used in financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds and payments related to our longterm debt dividend and distribution payments stock repurchases and the issuances of common stock pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans the 13348 million  increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to 7258 million  of stock repurchases an increase in dividend and distribution payments and the repayment of debt 

the 5474 million  decrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds and payments related to our longterm debt and an increase in dividend and distribution payments 

indebtedness 

see note 8  “ borrowings ” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

contractual commitments 



debt principal and interest represents principal and interest on borrowings under the 2017 senior notes and outstanding senior unsecured notes that we assumed as a result of the broadcom merger and brocade merger 

purchase commitments represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services primarily inventory that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with the internal fabrication facility expansion and construction of our new campuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and therefore cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above 

other contractual commitments represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to information technology human resources financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other service agreements 

operating lease obligations represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under noncancelable operating leases 

due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at november 4 2018  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 3088 million  of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of november 4 2018 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements at november 4 2018  as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk under the exchange act

we store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in malaysia however for selected customers we maintain finished goods inventory near or at customer manufacturing sites to support their justintime production 

materials and suppliers 

our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis these supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for redesign or qualification our longterm relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans and to monitor our suppliers financial health some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times limit supplies increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products if these are unique or highly specialized components we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all to address the potential disruption in our supply chain we may use a number of techniques including in some cases qualifying more than one source of supply redesigning products for alternative components and incremental or in some cases lifetime purchases of affected parts for supply buffer 

competition 

the global semiconductor market is highly competitive our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets we compete with integrated device manufacturers or idms and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market additionally our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors including quality technical performance price product features product system compatibility systemlevel design capability engineering expertise responsiveness to customers new product innovation product availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support

our primary competitors in the industrial  other segment are analog devices inc cree inc hamamatsu photonics kk heidenhain corporation renesas electronics corporation and toshiba corporation we compete based on our design expertise broad product portfolio reputation for quality products and large customer base 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade secrets and similar ip as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants and through security measures to protect our trade secrets we believe our current product expertise key engineering talent and ip portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 

as of october 29 2017  we had 24250  us and other patents and 2061  us and other pending patent applications our research and development efforts are presently resulting in approximately 150  new patent applications per year relating to a wide range of asic isolation encoder led rf and optoelectronic components enterprise storage products hdd silicon pcie usb and other standard io devices ethernet and fibrechannel connectivity and controllers settop box socs cable modem socs broadband access socs wireless connectivity socs switchingrouting socs high performance processor socs and associated applications the expiration dates of our patents range from 2018 to 2036  with a small number of patents expiring in the near future none of which are expected to be material to our ip portfolio we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 

we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research however we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 

we and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of ip licensing and crosslicensing arrangements that have both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors a portion of our revenue comes from ip licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to such ip we also license in thirdparty technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities products and manufacturing processes historically licenses of the thirdparty technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for thirdparty ip infringement claims claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us with respect to any ip rights claims against us or our customers or distributors we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product pay damages expend resources to develop noninfringing technology seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or relinquish patents or other ip rights 

employees 

as of october 29 2017  we had approximately 14000 employees worldwide by geography approximately 55  of our employees are located in north america 38  in asia and 7  in europe the middle east and africa in the united states none of our employees are represented by a labor union in singapore approximately 270  of our 829 employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement a small number of our employees in other countries is represented by workers councils or labor unions 

environmental and other regulation 

our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international federal state and local laws governing health safety and the environment these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air water and soil remediation requirements product chemical content limitations manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions pollution control requirements waste minimization considerations and treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we are also subject to regulation by the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws however the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 

we are also regulated under a number of international federal state and local laws regarding recycling product packaging and product content requirements including legislation enacted in the united states european union and china among a growing number of jurisdictions which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging these laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 

backlog 

our sales are generally made pursuant to shortterm purchase orders these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be and often are rescheduled canceled or modified on relatively short notice without substantial penalty therefore we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment this segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly in the wireless communications segment we have a diversified business portfolio and our wired infrastructure segment represents the largest portion of our net revenue we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of the diversification of our business portfolio

risk factors 

tableend as noted above broadcom is the successor to avago following the acquisition of brcm on february 1 2016 broadcom became the ultimate parent company of avago and brcm financial information and results of operations presented in this annual report on form 10k for periods prior to february 1 2016 relate to avago and relate to us for the periods after february 1 2016 

our business operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our ordinary shares the following important factors among others could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec press releases communications with investors and oral statements 

risks related to our business 

the majority of our sales comes from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 

we are dependent on a small number of end customers oems their respective contract manufacturers and certain distributors for a majority of our business revenue and results of operations sales to distributors accounted for 28  and 30  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively direct sales to foxconn accounted for 14  of our net revenue for both fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 40  of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017 and more than 30  for fiscal year 2016 we believe aggregates sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for more than 20  of our net revenue for fiscal year  2017 and approximately 15  for fiscal year 2016 this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant customers 

in addition our top customers’ purchasing power has in some cases given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general we expect this trend to continue which may adversely affect our gross margin on certain products and should we fail to comply with such terms might also result in substantial liability that could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover the terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our customers generally do not include commitments by those customers to purchase any specific quantities of products from us even in those instances where we enter into an arrangement under which a customer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us provided that we are able to meet specified development supply and quality commitments the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of volume of products purchased and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect as a result we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect under such arrangements if we do not perform under these arrangements we could also be liable for significant monetary damages 

the loss of or any substantial reduction in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply   chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market damage our   reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes thirdparty wafer foundry and module assembly and test capabilities referred to as contract manufacturers our products require semiconductor wafer manufacturers with stateoftheart fabrication equipment and techniques and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process typically at one particular fab or foundry either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer 

we depend on our contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptable yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis although we often have longterm contracts with our contract manufacturers we do not generally have longterm capacity commitments we obtain substantially all of our manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and our contract manufacturers have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product further from time to time our contract manufacturers will cease to or will become unable to manufacture a component for us as the lead time needed to identify qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields with a new contract manufacturer is typically lengthy there is often no readily available alternative source for the wafers or other contract manufacturing services we require and there may be other constraints on our ability to change contract manufacturers in addition qualifying such manufacturers is often expensive and they may not produce products as costeffectively as our current suppliers which would reduce our margins in any such circumstances we may be unable to meet our customer demand and may fail to meet our contractual obligations 

this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers and our net revenue could decline adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

we utilize tsmc to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers tsmc manufactured approximately threequarters of the wafers manufactured by our contract manufacturers during the fiscal year  ended october 29 2017  our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc however tsmc also fabricates wafers for other companies including certain of our competitors and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice or raise their prices to us all of which could harm our business results of operations and gross margin 

any substantial disruption in tsmc’s supply of wafers to us or in the other contract manufacturing services that we utilize as a result of a natural disaster political unrest economic instability equipment failure or other cause could materially harm our business customer relationships and results of operations 

we also depend on our thirdparty contract manufacturers to timely develop new advanced manufacturing processes including in the case of wafer fabrication transitions to smaller geometry process technologies if these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or deliver products to our customers which could result in loss of revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers 

we purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers 

our manufacturing processes rely on many materials including silicon gaas and inp wafers copper lead frames precious and rare earth metals mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers some of which are single source suppliers during the fiscal year  ended october 29 2017  we purchased approximately twothirds of the materials for our manufacturing processes from five materials providers substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis and we do not generally have longterm contracts with our materials providers suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases capacity constraints or other factors which may lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry in the event that we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials or at reasonable prices the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we may pursue acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth strategy includes the acquisition of and investment in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities such as our acquisition of brocade we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities or to consummate any such transactions in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction that we make may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction including our acquisition of brocade 

any acquisitions we may undertake involve risks and uncertainties such as unexpected delays challenges and related expenses and diversion of management’s attention for example regulatory approvals required in connection with an acquisition such as those from the us department of justice or the federal trade commission may take longer than anticipated to obtain may not be obtained at all or may contain materially burdensome conditions if any conditions or changes to the structure of an acquisition are required to obtain these regulatory approvals they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of such acquisition or reducing our anticipated benefits of the transaction if we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any such approvals or if we fail to comply with any such conditions our business and results of operations may be adversely affected for example if we do not complete our redomiciliation within one year from the closing we agreed to initiate a process to separate and divest the brocade san business if we fail to complete an acquisition our share price could fall to the extent the price reflects an assumption that such acquisition will be completed and we may have incurred significant unrecoverable costs further the failure to consummate an acquisition may result in negative publicity and adversely impact our relationships with our customers vendors and employees we may become subject to legal proceedings relating to the acquisition and the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful the integration of an acquired business involves significant challenges including among others minimizing the disruption of our business diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and integrating the personnel of acquired businesses incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense assuming liabilities and ongoing lawsuits potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and increasing our expenses and working capital requirements and implementing our management information systems operating systems and internal controls over the acquired operations these difficulties may be complicated by factors such as the size of the business or entity acquired geographic 

distances and cultural differences lack of experience operating in the geographic markets or industry sectors of the acquired business potential loss of key employees and customers the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business performance problems with the acquired business’ technology exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition adverse tax consequences and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects or synergies expected from any such acquisition 

failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business operating results and margins 

any future acquisitions we make may require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings and in the case of an equity or equitylinked financing would be dilutive to our existing shareholders any downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs as a result we may be unable to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past or at all these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability of acquired businesses or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we recently made an offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of qualcomm we do not yet know the outcome of this proposed acquisition however any such transaction will be subject to all of the risks discussed above and we will need to incur a significant amount of indebtedness to fund the transaction 

from time to time we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business that are not strategically important both acquired or otherwise such as the brocade ip networking business or we may exit minority investments each of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations any future dispositions we may make could involve risks and uncertainties including our ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition any such dispositions could result in disruption to other parts of our business potential loss of employees or customers exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such dispositions for example in connection with such dispositions we often enter into transition services agreements or other strategic relationships including longterm research and development arrangements sales arrangements or agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction which may result in additional expense and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition dispositions may include the transfer of technology andor the licensing of certain ip rights to thirdparty purchasers which could limit our ability to assert our ip rights against such thirdparty purchasers 

failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could adversely affect our   results of operations 

we make significant decisions including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept production schedules levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements based on our estimates of customer requirements factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the shortterm nature of many customers’ commitments our customers’ ability to reschedule cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty the accuracy of our customers’ forecasts and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for our customers’ products as well as seasonal or cyclical trends in their industries or the semiconductor industry 

to ensure availability of our products particularly for our largest customers we typically start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers’ forecasts which are not binding as a result we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected if actual demand for our products is lower than forecast we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence because certain of our sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income 

conversely customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice we may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand this could damage our customer relationships reduce revenue growth and margins subject us to additional liabilities harm our reputation and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities 

we are dependent on a limited number of markets and dynamics in these markets could negatively impact our business or results of operations   

we operate in a limited number of markets if demand in these markets declines or grows at a significantly slower pace than expected our results may be adversely affected the success of our wired infrastructure segment is primarily dependent on information technology or it and data center spending which can vary dramatically from quarter to quarter consumer 

demand for traditional paytv services capital expenditures on the installation of broadband capacity and our ability to transition our products to increasingly smaller line width geometries our wireless communications segment is primarily dependent on the mobile handset market which is characterized by intense competition rapidly evolving technologies and changing consumer preferences and our success is dependent on the overall demand for mobile handsets and macroeconomic conditions in general as well as the relative success of the mobile handsets into which our products are incorporated 

similar to our wired infrastructure segment our enterprise storage segment is dependent on data center spending as well as hddrelated sales in addition the shift to cloudbased it solutions and services such as hyperscale computing may adversely affect both our wired infrastructure and enterprise storage segments we currently sell a substantial portion of our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers as cloudbased it solutions become more prevalent our results of operations will suffer if we are unable to increase sales of our products to cloudbased data center providers 

we are subject to risks associated with our distributors including product inventory levels and   product sellthrough 

we sell many of our products through distributors who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end customers sales to distributors accounted for 28  of our net revenue in the fiscal year  ended october 29 2017  if our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any reason our sales to these distributors and our revenue may decline we also face the risk that our distributors may increase inventory levels of our products in any particular quarter in excess of future anticipated sales if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these distributors for any reason these distributors may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand which would harm our business and could adversely affect our revenue in such subsequent periods we have streamlined the number of distributors we use making us increasingly dependent on our remaining distributors which may exacerbate the foregoing risks and increase our related credit risk 

we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products sold through distributors as a result our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested including for example medical devices and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications in such event failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 

our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our   senior management team 

our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our senior management team and in particular the services of mr hock e tan our president and chief executive officer none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts in addition we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 

our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 

our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 



 the foregoing factors are often difficult to predict and these as well as other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results in addition a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations as a result we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares may occur 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel especially our   design and technical personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy   effectively 

our future success depends on our ability to retain attract and motivate qualified personnel we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel through acquisitions we may make from time to time or otherwise we have historically encountered some difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers particularly in silicon valley and southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand in addition our employees including employees whom we have retained as a result of an acquisition may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little or no notice as the source of our technological and product innovations our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset any inability to retain attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 

adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally as well as in our target markets which have adversely affected our business and results of operations in recent periods investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook have adversely affected market and business conditions in general macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue gross margin and expenses sustained uncertainty about or worsening of current global economic conditions may cause our customers and consumers to reduce or delay spending could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers and customers and could intensify pricing pressures any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business financial condition and result of operations 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion evolving technical standards frequent new product introductions short product life cycles for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand from time to time these factors together with changes in general economic conditions cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for enduser products high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices resulting in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even 

when overall economic conditions are relatively stable if we cannot offset industry or market downturns our net revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

our proposed redomiciliation may adversely impact our overall cash tax costs if we do not complete the redomiciliation within one year of the brocade merger we may be required to divest our brocade san business 

on november 2 2017 we announced our intention to initiate a process to change the ultimate parent company of the broadcom group from a singapore company to a us corporation the final form and the timing of the redomiciliation has not yet been finalized and may be affected by the 2017 tax reform act in addition the redomiciliation is subject to the approval of our shareholders we presently expect our overall cash tax costs will approximately double as compared to our fiscal year 2017 results due to the redomiciliation and taking in account the expected effects of the 2017 tax reform act 

furthermore in connection with the completion of the brocade merger we agreed to initiate a process to separate and divest the brocade san business if we do not complete this redomiciliation within one year after the brocade merger any such divestiture could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

winning business is subject to lengthy competitive bid selection processes that often require us to incur significant expense from which we may ultimately generate no revenue 

our business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product this can result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes 

winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any a delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it in addition the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins occurring at the same time may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional unanticipated costs and expenses often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units from us until they qualify the products andor the manufacturing line for those products the qualification process can take significant time and resources and we may not always be able to satisfy customers’ qualification requirements delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue finally customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or may fail to successfully market and sell their products which could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory materially adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products and the end products into which our products are incorporated often have very short life cycles 

competition in our industry could prevent us from growing our revenue 

the global semiconductor market is highly competitive we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings competition may further increase as companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future in addition the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry as some of our direct competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other we expect this consolidation trend to continue 

some of our competitors may have greater resources for manufacturing distribution financial research and development or marketing resources than us in addition some of our competitors may also have a greater presence in key markets a larger customer base or more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection than us we compete with idms and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large integrated oems because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics as well as customers that may develop their own ic products our competitors in these markets range from large international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products and devices to smaller companies specializing in niche markets and new technologies 

if we are unable to compete successfully we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities research and development facilities or other significant operations or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse   effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities in particular in fort collins colorado singapore and breinigsville pennsylvania we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes to protect our ip to accelerate time to market of our products and to ensure supply of certain components our fort collins and breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for our fbar components used in many of our wireless devices and for the inpbased wafers used in our fibre optics products respectively many of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers and suppliers are located in california and the pacific rim region which has above average seismic activity and severe weather activity in addition our research and development personnel are primarily concentrated in china india israel malaysia singapore south korea taiwan fort collins colorado san jose california southern california and breinigsville and allentown pennsylvania with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas 

a prolonged disruption at one or more of our manufacturing or research facilities for any reason especially our fort collins singapore and breinigsville facilities or those of our contract manufacturers or suppliers due to natural or manmade disasters or other events outside of our control such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness at one or more of these facilities would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment if necessary were found any such event would likely disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand expose us to claims by our customers resulting in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market as a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities all of which could materially and adversely affect our business although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and any such uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results in addition even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affected products if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity at our own manufacturing facilities which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must maintain appropriate capacity at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand for our proprietary products from time to time this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities which often involves substantial cost and other risks such as delays in completion such expanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient or may not come online soon enough to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation forgo sales or lose customers as a result conversely if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities all of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

any failure of our it systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide   necessary services could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on various it systems including networks applications internal it systems and personnel and outsourced services for among other things financial reporting and product orders and shipments we rely on thirdparty vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services including certain services related to accounting billing shipping human resources benefit plan administration it network development and network monitoring while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us we may be unable to collect on any award of damages and any award may be insufficient to cover the actual costs we may incur as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform under its agreement with us upon expiration or termination of any of our thirdparty vendor agreements we may not be able to timely replace the vendor on terms and conditions including service levels and cost that are favorable to us in addition a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete 

any failure of these internal or thirdparty systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand manage our supply chain and production facilities fulfill customer orders and report financial and other information on a timely and accurate basis 

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our product mix price erosion acquisitions we may make level of capacity utilization and commodity prices 

our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products as well as the timing and amount of our nonproduct and 

iprelated revenue could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages although our nonproduct revenue is generally high margin it fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter in addition increased competition and the existence of product alternatives more complex engineering requirements lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenue and lower margin for us in the future 

our gross margin may also be adversely affected by expenses related to the acquisitions of businesses such as amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and impairment charges furthermore businesses or companies that we acquire may have different gross margin profiles than us and could therefore also affect our overall gross margin 

in addition semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities such as depreciation expense will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin furthermore fluctuations in commodity prices either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy or as a result of price increases passed on to us by our suppliers could negatively impact our margins we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices some of which including gold and fuel prices are very volatile and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 

the enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

corporate tax reform baseerosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where we have business operations as a result policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions for example the 2017 tax reform act adopting broad us corporate income tax reform will among other things reduce the us corporate income tax rate but will impose baseerosion prevention measures on nonus earnings of us entities as well as a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated nonus earnings of us entities the 2017 tax reform act will affect the tax position reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and our obligations for cash taxes of our us entities and will have a corresponding impact on our consolidated financial results starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 

in addition many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the organisation for economic cooperation’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy including changes to crossborder tax transferpricing documentation rules and nexusbased tax incentive practices as a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities and legislative investigation and inquiry which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change 

due to the large scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results of operations generally 

if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and   other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable in part or in whole for any reason or if our   assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday   arrangements prove to be incorrect the amount of corporate income taxes we have to   pay could significantly increase 

our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example we have obtained tax incentives from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore which provide that qualifying income we earn in singapore is subject to tax holiday or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments the singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire at various dates generally between 2020 and 2021 subject in certain cases to potential extensions which we may or may not be able to obtain and any subsequent changes in incentive scope absent these tax incentives the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our singapore taxable income would be 17 we also have tax holidays on our qualifying income in malaysia which are scheduled to expire between 2018 and 2028 the tax incentives and tax holidays that we have obtained are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may in some instances be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive we could in some instances be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as 

beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present arrangements the effect of all these tax incentives and tax holidays in the aggregate was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately 237 million 169 million and 207 million for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively to increase diluted net income per share by 056 and 074 in fiscal years 2017 and 2015 respectively and to reduce diluted net loss per share by 044 for fiscal year 2016 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 

our overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors including reorganizations or restructurings of our businesses or assets jurisdictional revenue mix and changes in tax regulations or policy and may be further impacted if our ultimate parent company redomiciles from singapore to the us all of which could materially adversely affect financial results 

we are currently a singaporebased multinational company subject to tax in various tax jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain additionally our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 at the time we completed our acquisition of brcm or the broadcom merger in connection with the preliminary allocation of the purchase price we established a deferred tax liability on our balance sheet this liability is associated with our potential tax liability arising from our planned integration of brcm’s ip which was completed in november 2016 this deferred tax liability was established using an assumed effective us corporate income tax rate of 35 however the 2017 tax reform act lowers this rate to 21 which will result in a material reduction in the amount of other longterm liabilities on our balance sheet in addition prior to the adoption of the 2017 tax reform act this tax liability would have become payable in the us as earnings resulting from this integration of ip were distributed over time however under the 2017 tax reform act we will be required to recognize all of these earnings in our fiscal year 2018 as a deemed repatriation of foreign earnings subject to a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax this repatriation tax which we preliminarily estimate to be approximately 13 billion to 25 billion in the aggregate will be payable over eight years starting in fiscal year 2018 this repatriation tax will increase the amount of our cash taxes payable by an initial amount of at least 100 million to 200 million per year starting in fiscal year 2018 our initial estimates of the financial impact of the 2017 tax reform act may change as we refine our analysis and as additional guidance becomes available 

we have also adopted transfer pricing policies between our affiliated entities our policies call for the provision of services the sale of products the advance of financing and grant of licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful result in adjustments for prior or future years as a result of these adjustments we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings and results of operations would be adversely affected in any period in which such determination is made 

although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement of tax liabilities prescribed in the relevant accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions which if resolved unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes and our payment obligation with respect to any such taxes 

in addition we are subject to and are under tax audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax positions are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals the ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we may be involved in legal proceedings including ip anticompetition and securities litigation employeerelated claims and governmental investigations which could among other things divert efforts of management and result in   significant expense and loss of our ip rights 

we are often involved in legal proceedings including cases involving our ip rights and those of others anticompetition and commercial matters mergerrelated suits securities class action suits employeerelated claims and other actions some of these actions may seek injunctive relief including injunctions or exclusion orders against the sale of our products and substantial monetary damages which if granted or awarded could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we may also be involved or required to participate in governmental investigations litigation or settlement of such actions regardless of their merit or involvement in governmental investigations can be complex can extend for a protracted period of time may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel is frequently costly and the related expenditures unpredictable an unfavorable resolution of a governmental investigation may include among others fines or other orders to pay money andor the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct andor modify our business practices 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit protection and enforcement of ip rights including actions by patentholding companies that do not make or sell products from time to time third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent copyright trademark trade secret and other ip rights to technologies that are important to our business 

many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for thirdparty ip infringement claims including costs to defend those claims and payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in ip litigation if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome we could be required to 

 any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired in connection with litigation or regulatory investigations these liabilities 

could be substantial and may include among other things the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals as well as stockholder derivative suits the cost of government law enforcement or regulatory investigations civil or criminal fines and penalties legal and other expenses and expenses associated with the remedial measure if any which may be imposed 

we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business if we are   unable or fail to protect our ip our business could be adversely   affected 

our success depends in part upon protecting our ip to accomplish this we rely on a combination of ip rights including patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets as well as customary contractual protections with our customers suppliers employees and consultants we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our ip rights that are valuable to our business we are unable to predict or assure that 

 in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the united states may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions we may elect to abandon or divest patents or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications due to strategic concerns or other factors in addition when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 

we also generate some of our revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our ip licensing of our ip rights particularly exclusive licenses may limit our ability to assert those ip rights against third parties including the licensee of those rights in addition we may acquire companies with ip that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties these licensing obligations may extend to our own ip following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our ip rights from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights including in some cases against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships such as customers and suppliers claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us conversely third parties may pursue ip litigation against us including as a result of our ip licensing business an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our ip against others in addition such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 

we are subject to warranty claims product recalls and product liability 

from time to time we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may in the future lead to significant expense our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions relating to product quality issues the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant and in some cases including in agreements with some of our largest customers are potentially unlimited any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products costs payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future 

product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims or we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our devices in such an event we may incur significant costs and expenses including among others replacement costs contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims conversely in some cases amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 

the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or   undetected defects or bugs which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new   products damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and   materially and adversely affect our operating costs 

highly complex products such as those we offer may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development if any of our products including products of companies we have acquired or thirdparty components used in our products contain defects or bugs or have reliability quality or compatibility problems we may not be able to successfully design workarounds furthermore if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall repair or replacement costs consequently our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers to resolve these problems we may have to invest significant capital and other resources these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others for example if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s endproduct delivery we may be required under the terms of our agreement with that customer to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays in addition these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and we would likely lose or experience a delay in market acceptance of the affected product or products as a result our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

we make substantial investments in research and development to enhance existing and develop new technologies to keep pace with technological advances and to remain competitive in our business and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements short product cycles and evolving industry standards and requires substantial investment in our research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products in addition semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries this requires us to adapt our products and manufacturing processes to these new technologies which requires expertise in new procedures our failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position in order to remain competitive we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development we expect the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted demand for our products may be reduced significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products which would have a negative impact on our financial results 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely   affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we   conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 

a majority of our products are produced and sourced in asia including china india malaysia the philippines singapore south korea taiwan and thailand and we sell our products throughout the world in addition as of october 29 2017  approximately 38  of our employees are located in asia multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 



 a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations including anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws and export regulations in addition the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may in some cases conflict with each other although our code of ethics and business conduct and other policies prohibit us our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anticorruption policies and procedures any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to various governmental regulations and compliance with   these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense if we fail to maintain   compliance with applicable regulations we may be forced to cease   the manufacture and distribution of certain products and we could be subject to civil or criminal   penalties 

our business is subject to various international laws and other legal requirements including packaging product content labor and importexport regulations such as the us export administration regulations and many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have generally become more stringent over time and may intensify under the current us administration we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violations of these regulations in addition if our customers fail to comply with these regulations we may be required to suspend sales to these customers which could negatively impact our results of operations 

in addition the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatory requirements as they occur for example if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widely shared it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt crossborder manufacturing relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to comply with these requirements we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution in addition it is expected that the current us administration’s trade policy will promote us manufacturing and manufacturers it is unclear what effect this will have on us as a multinational company that conducts business worldwide or on our suppliers customers contract manufacturers and oems 

our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies like the international standards organization as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations our business could be harmed 

we are subject to environmental health and safety laws which could increase our   costs restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material   adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of international laws and regulations relating to the use disposal cleanup of and human exposure to hazardous materials compliance with environmental health and safety requirements could among other things require us to modify our manufacturing processes restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire pollution control equipment all of which can be very costly any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigation against us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment in addition complying with any cleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our products including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in various countries including the united states china japan and in the european union increase the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to reengineer our products such reengineering may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we may also experience claims 

from employees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims 

social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer demand may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers 

there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with or they seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions an increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the un global compact a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop implement and disclose sustainability policies and practices these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply with such policies or provisions a customer may stop purchasing products from us and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

in addition as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products since our supply chain is complex we are not currently able to definitively ascertain the origins of all of these minerals and metals used in our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

the average selling prices of products in our markets have often decreased   rapidly and may do so in the future which could harm our revenue and gross   profit 

the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications as a result the prices of those products have often decreased rapidly gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by among other things pricing pressures from our customers in the past we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors in addition some of our customer agreements provide for volumebased pricing and product pricing roadmaps which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes reducing manufacturing costs or developing new and higher valueadded products on a timely basis 

a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business   

our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers’ suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information as well as our own proprietary information however we are also dependent on a number of thirdparty cloudbased and other service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to among other things human resources electronic communication services and certain finance functions and we are of necessity dependent on the security systems of these providers accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties or our employees or contractors of our facilities our information systems or the systems of our cloudbased or other service providers or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information including information relating to our products or customers and the personal information of our employees in addition we have from time to time also been subject to unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own it networks any theft or misuse of confidential personal or proprietary information as a result of such activities could result in among other things unfavorable publicity damage to our reputation loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information difficulty in marketing our products allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business profitability and financial condition since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 

we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual   basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of   investor confidence in our financial reports significant expense to remediate any   internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our share   price 

we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act even though as of october 29 2017 we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes including to reflect our integration of brocade as well as any future acquisitions we may undertake this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive time consuming and requires significant management attention we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404 furthermore as we grow our business or acquire other businesses our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls either in our existing business or in businesses that we acquire could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls the disclosure of that fact even if quickly remedied may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline 

remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to remedy any material weakness our financial statements may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statements our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital markets may be restricted the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities including the sec or the nasdaq global select market 

our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employeebenefit related costs and expense 

we sponsor several defined benefit plans and postretirement medical benefit plans we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans the difference between the obligations and assets of these plans or the funded status of these plans is a significant factor in determining our pension expense and the ongoing funding requirements of these plans the projected benefit obligations under these pension plans exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately 82 million at the end of fiscal year 2017  we expect to have additional funding requirements in future years and we may make additional voluntary contributions to the plans depending on our cash position at the time any such funding or contributions to our pension plans could impact our operating flexibility and financial position including adversely affecting our cash flow for the quarter in which they are made 

furthermore in order to reduce the expenses associated with these programs where practicable we are seeking to move defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans or to cash out future retirees not yet receiving benefits and to replace existing pension obligations with annuities any such changes may adversely affect our results of operations including our profitability and cash flows weak economic conditions and related underperformance of asset markets could also lead to an increase in postretirement benefit expense 

the internal revenue service may not agree that broadcom limited should be treated as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes 

a corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes because broadcom is currently a singapore entity it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation and therefore not a us tax resident under these rules even so the internal revenue service or irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code 

under section 7874 of the code if the former shareholders of brcm hold 80 or more of the vote or value of the ordinary shares of broadcom by reason of their former holding of brcm common shares the percentage by vote and value of our ordinary shares considered to be held for purposes of section 7874 of the code by former brcm shareholders immediately after the broadcom merger by reason of holding brcm common shares is referred to in this disclosure as the “section 7874 percentage” and our expanded affiliated group after the broadcom transaction does not have substantial business activities in singapore relative to our worldwide business activities broadcom would be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes if the section 7874 percentage were determined to be at least 60 but less than 80 section 7874 of the code would cause broadcom to be treated as a “surrogate foreign corporation” if we did not have substantial business activities in singapore relative to our worldwide business activities 

under current law broadcom should not be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes however determining the section 7874 percentage is complex and is subject to factual and legal uncertainties including that such determination takes into account several factors other than the ratio of ownership of our ordinary shares by former brcm shareholders following the broadcom merger while we believe the section 7874 percentage to be significantly less than 60 and therefore that section 7874 should not apply to broadcom or brcm there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with the position that the section 7874 percentage is less than 60 

if the section 7874 percentage were determined to be at least 60 but less than 80 several limitations could apply to brcm for example brcm would be prohibited from using its net operating losses foreign tax credits or other tax attributes to offset the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer of property to a foreign related person during the 10year period following the broadcom merger or any income received or accrued during such period by reason of a license of any property by brcm to a foreign related person in addition the irs has announced that it will promulgate new rules which in that situation may limit the ability to restructure the nonus members of the brcm tax group or access cash earned in its nonus subsidiaries moreover in such case section 4985 of the code and rules related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectly by certain brcm “disqualified individuals” including former officers and directors of brcm at a rate equal to 15 but only if a gain is otherwise recognized by brcm shareholders as a result of the broadcom merger 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

as of october 29 2017  our total consolidated indebtedness under our senior unsecured notes that were issued and sold in january 2017 or the january 2017 senior notes and our senior unsecured notes that were issued and sold in october 2017 or the october 2017 senior note collectively the senior notes was 17689 million  subject to restrictions in the indentures governing our senior notes or the indentures we have the ability to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including 

  the indentures also place limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate merge sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets in addition the indentures contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which after any applicable grace period the noteholders would have the ability to immediately declare the debt due and payable in such event we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states credit rating agencies regularly revise their ratings for companies they follow including us factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels planned asset purchases or sales and nearterm and longterm production growth opportunities liquidity asset quality cost structure reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of our senior notes or the trading market for our senior notes any credit rating downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or to refinance our outstanding indebtedness at similar rates or at all increase the cost of current or future debt and significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt 

our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on and to refinance our debt depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the senior notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed which could result in a default on our indebtedness 

the trading prices of the senior notes may be volatile 

the trading prices of the senior notes could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to among other factors changes in our operating results interest rates the market for debt securities general economic conditions and securities analysts’ recommendations if any regarding our securities 

risks relating to investments in singapore companies 

it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of us courts for civil liabilities under   us federal securities laws against us or our directors in singapore 

broadcom is incorporated under the laws of the republic of singapore and certain of our directors are resident outside the united states moreover a majority of our consolidated assets are located outside the united states although broadcom is incorporated outside the united states we have agreed to accept service of process in the united states through our agent designated for certain purposes nevertheless since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us are located outside the united states any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states 

there is no ratified treaty between the united states and singapore providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws would therefore not be automatically enforceable in singapore there is doubt whether a singapore court may impose civil liability on broadcom or our directors and officers who reside in singapore in a suit brought in the singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal securities laws of the united states consequently there can be no assurance as to whether singapore courts will enter judgments in actions brought in singapore courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 

broadcom is incorporated in singapore and our shareholders may have more difficulty in   protecting their interest than they would as shareholders of a corporation   incorporated in the united states and we may have more difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executives 

broadcom’s corporate affairs are governed by its constitution and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in singapore the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of the members of our board under singapore law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states therefore our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest in connection with actions taken by our management or members of our board than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 

in addition being a public company incorporated in singapore may make it more expensive for broadcom to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board particularly to serve on committees of our board 

for a limited period of time our directors have general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares on such terms and conditions as may be determined by our board in its sole discretion 

under singapore law we may only allot and issue new ordinary shares with the prior approval of broadcom’s shareholders in a general meeting at our 2017 annual general meeting broadcom’s shareholders provided our directors with the general authority to allot and issue any number of new ordinary shares which will continue in force until the earlier of i the conclusion of our annual general meeting in 2018 ii the expiration of the period within which the next annual general meeting is required by law to be held ie within 15 months after the conclusion of the last general meeting or iii the subsequent revocation or modification of such general authority by our shareholders at a duly convened general meeting subject to the general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares provided by our shareholders the provisions of the 

singapore companies act and broadcom’s constitution our board may allot and issue new ordinary shares on such terms and conditions as they may think fit to impose any additional issuances of new ordinary shares by our directors may adversely impact the market price of our ordinary shares and dilute your share ownership

at times broadcom’s share price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the   future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources 

the trading price of broadcom ordinary shares has at times fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and others including 

 these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or currency fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future we are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions of plx technology inc or plx emulex and brocade securities litigation against us including the lawsuits related to such transactions could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

a substantial amount of our shares is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our ordinary shares in the public market by one or more of these holders could cause our share price to fall 

as of september 30 2017 we believe that our two largest shareholders capital world investors and capital research global investors held approximately 17 of broadcom outstanding ordinary shares in the aggregate these investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depress the market price of our ordinary shares in addition any such sales of our ordinary shares by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 

our board has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on broadcom ordinary shares on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all furthermore we may declare dividends as interim dividends which are wholly provisional under singapore law and may be revoked by our board at any time prior to the payment thereof 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors management’s views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions earnings levels contractual restrictions cash position and overall financial condition and changes to our business model the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law contractual restrictions and our corporate structure pursuant to singapore law and broadcom’s constitution no dividends may be paid except out of our profits or expected profits based on singapore accounting standards because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends on broadcom ordinary shares is also limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries 

singapore corporate law may impede a takeover of our company by a thirdparty which   could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 

the singapore code on takeovers and mergers contains provisions that may delay deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of our company for so long as we remain a public company with more than 50 shareholders and net tangible assets of s5 million or more any person acquiring an interest whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person in 30 or more of our voting shares or if such person holds either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person between 30 and 50 both inclusive of our voting shares and such person or parties acting in concert with such person acquires additional voting shares representing more than 1 of our voting shares in any sixmonth period must except with the consent of the securities industry council in singapore extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the singapore code on takeovers and mergers while the singapore code on takeovers and mergers seeks to ensure equality of treatment among shareholders its provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control of our company these legal requirements may impede or delay a takeover of our company by a thirdparty which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 

our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 

from time to time we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release this guidance which consists of forwardlooking statements is prepared by our management and is qualified by and subject to the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles examines or reviews the guidance and accordingly no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 

guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that while presented with numerical specificity is inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions some of which will change we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of these ranges the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 

guidance is necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies as our management will necessarily be less familiar with their business procedures and operations accordingly our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data are forecast in light of the foregoing investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 

any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form 10k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance and such differences may be adverse and material 

risks relating to restricted exchangeable units 

the exchange of the partnership reus into broadcom ordinary shares is subject to significant restrictions including the right of broadcom in its sole discretion to cause the partnership to repurchase such partnership reus for cash instead of broadcom ordinary shares 

holders of partnership reus or limited partners may subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in the partnership’s amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement as amended from time to time or the partnership agreement require the partnership to repurchase all or any portion of such limited partner’s partnership reus in exchange for broadcom ordinary shares at a ratio of one broadcom ordinary share for each partnership reu or the exchange right however broadcom in its sole discretion as general partner has the right to cause the partnership to repurchase the partnership reus for cash in an amount determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement based on the market price of broadcom ordinary shares in lieu of broadcom ordinary shares although we are currently issuing broadcom ordinary shares upon exchange of partnership reus broadcom in its sole discretion as general partner may choose to cause the partnership to repurchase the partnership reus for cash at any time and without notice the payment of cash upon exchange of partnership reus could result in among other things tax consequences that differ from those that would have resulted if the holder of such partnership reus had received broadcom ordinary shares 

in addition prior to february 1 2019 following the effective time of the broadcom merger it is a condition precedent to the obligation of the partnership to repurchase such partnership reus and the holder of such partnership reus shall not be permitted to exercise the exchange right unless i broadcom has received a written opinion from an independent nationally recognized law or accounting firm that the exchange right should not cause broadcom to be treated as a a “surrogate foreign corporation” within the meaning of section 7874a2b of the code or b a “domestic corporation” within the meaning of section 7874b of the code and ii broadcom’s independent auditor has determined that no reserve shall be required for financial accounting purposes relating to section 7874 of the code as a result of the exercise of such exchange right although limited partners are currently permitted to exercise their exchange rights no assurance can be provided as to whether the above conditions precedent will be satisfied in the future 

the exchange of partnership reus is a us taxable event 

the exchange of partnership reus will be treated for us tax purposes as a taxable sale of the partnership reus by the limited partner making the exchange a limited partner will recognize gain or loss for us income tax purposes in an amount equal to the fair market value of our ordinary shares or the cash amount received in the exchange plus the amount of the partnership’s liabilities allocable to the partnership reus being exchanged less the limited partner’s adjusted tax basis in the partnership reus exchanged the recognition of any loss resulting from an exchange of partnership reus is subject to a number of limitations set forth in the code it is possible that the amount of gain recognized or even the tax liability resulting from the gain could exceed the value of our ordinary shares or cash amount received upon the exchange in addition a limited partner may have difficulty finding buyers for a substantial number of ordinary shares in order to raise cash to pay tax liabilities associated with the exchange of their partnership reus and may not receive a price for the ordinary shares equal to the value of the partnership reus at the time of the exchange 

an active trading market for partnership reus is not expected to develop 

the partnership reus are not listed on a national exchange in the united states or on a foreign exchange an active trading market for the partnership reus is not expected to develop in addition although the partnership reus are registered under the exchange act broadcom as general partner is under no obligation to continue such registration and is authorized to deregister the partnership reus at any time such registration is not legally required as a result it will be very difficult to sell the partnership reus at a price that is attractive or at all 

future sales of broadcom ordinary shares in the public market could cause the value of partnership reus to fall 

sales of a substantial number of broadcom ordinary shares in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the value of the partnership reus because the value of the partnership reus is derivative of the value of broadcom ordinary shares 

the value of the broadcom ordinary shares received in any exchange of the partnership reus or the cash amount to be paid by us in lieu thereof may fluctuate 

the value of the broadcom ordinary shares into which the partnership reus may be exchanged or the cash amount to be paid by the partnership in lieu thereof may be subject to significant fluctuations for many reasons 

consequently due to these potential fluctuations in value of broadcom ordinary shares at the time that the exchange right is exercised the broadcom ordinary shares into which partnership reus may be exchanged or the cash amount to be paid in lieu thereof may have a value that differs from the value of broadcom ordinary shares as of the effective time of the broadcom merger also see “at times broadcom’s share price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the   future which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources” regarding fluctuations in the value of broadcom ordinary shares 

there can be no assurance that the partnership will continue to declare cash distributions 

pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement broadcom as general partner and our limited partners are entitled to receive distributions from the partnership if and when broadcom pays dividends to holders of its ordinary shares there can be no assurance that broadcom will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all also see “ there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends ” regarding factors that may affect the timing and amount of dividends paid by broadcom 

in certain circumstances a limited partner may lose its limited liability status 

the exempted limited partnership law 2014 of the cayman islands as amended and any successor to such statute or the cayman islands limited partnerships act provides a limited partner with the benefits of limited liability unless in addition to exercising rights and powers as a limited partner such limited partner takes part in the control or conduct of the business of the limited partnership subject to certain qualifications and exceptions subject to the provisions of the cayman islands 

limited partnerships act and of similar legislation in other jurisdictions the liability of each limited partner for the debts liabilities and obligations of the partnership will be limited to the limited partner’s capital contribution plus the limited partner’s share of any undistributed income of the partnership however pursuant to the cayman islands limited partnerships act where a limited partner has received a payment representing the return of all or part of that limited partner’s capital contribution or is released from any outstanding obligation in respect of his commitment and at the time that payment was made or release effected i the limited partnership is insolvent and ii the limited partner had actual knowledge of the insolvency of the limited partnership then for a period of six months but not thereafter such limited partner would be liable to the partnership or where the partnership is dissolved to its creditors to repay such payment or perform the released obligation with interest to the extent that such contribution or part thereof is necessary to discharge the liabilities of the partnership to all creditors who extended credit or whose claims otherwise arose before the return of the capital contribution 

the limitation of liability conferred under the cayman islands limited partnerships act may be ineffective outside the cayman islands except to the extent it is given extraterritorial recognition or effect by the laws of other jurisdictions there may also be requirements to be satisfied in each jurisdiction to maintain limited liability if limited liability is lost limited partners may be considered to be general partners and therefore be subject to unlimited liability in such jurisdiction by creditors and others having claims against the partnership 

under certain circumstances the voting rights of the partnership reus will be limited 

each holder of partnership reus has the benefit of a voting trust agreement dated february 1 2016 among the partnership broadcom and the voting trustee or the voting trust agreement pursuant to the terms of the voting trust agreement the voting trustee holds noneconomic voting preference shares of broadcom or special voting shares that entitle the voting trustee to a number of votes equal to the number of votes that would attach to the broadcom ordinary shares receivable upon the exchange of the partnership reus as of the record date of a broadcom shareholder meeting holders of partnership reus are entitled to direct the voting trustee under the voting trust agreement to vote the number of special voting shares equal to the number of partnership reus held by such holder in substantially all votes that are presented to the holders of broadcom ordinary shares however in the event that under applicable law any matter requires the approval of the holder of record of a special voting share voting separately as a class the voting trust agreement restricts the ability of holders of partnership reus to exercise such voting rights

dividends and distributions 

in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  broadcom declared and paid the following quarterly cash dividends on a per share basis 

pursuant to the partnership agreement starting in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and onwards a cash distribution per partnership reu was declared and paid equal to and simultaneously with that of the broadcom quarterly cash dividend per ordinary share 

on december 4 2017  the board declared an interim cash dividend of 175  per broadcom ordinary share payable on december 29 2017  to shareholders of record at the close of business eastern time on december 19 2017  or the broadcom dividend broadcom paid aggregate cash dividends and distributions of 1745 million  and 750 million  in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively

interests future dividend payments will also depend upon factors such as our earnings level capital requirements contractual restrictions cash position overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevant by our board 

the payment of cash dividends on broadcom ordinary shares is restricted under applicable law and our corporate structure pursuant to singapore law and broadcom’s constitution no cash dividends may be paid except out of our profits or expected profits also because we are a holding company our ability to pay cash dividends on broadcom ordinary shares and cash distributions on our partnership reus may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries including restrictions under the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k this discussion may contain forwardlooking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the caption “risk factors” or in other parts of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

broadcom limited or broadcom is the successor to avago technologies limited or avago as a result of its acquisition of broadcom corporation or brcm we are a leading designer developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog iiiv based products we have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment mobile handsets and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays we have four reportable segments wired infrastructure wireless communications enterprise storage and industrial  other which align with our principal target markets 

broadcom cayman lp or the partnership is an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the cayman islands pursuant to the amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement or the partnership agreement it authorized its common partnership units and restricted exchangeable limited partnership units or partnership reus the partnership reus are deemed to be registered under section 12b of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act and the partnership is subject to the informational requirements of the exchange act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder broadcom its general partner has the exclusive right power and authority to manage control administer and operate the business and affairs and to make decisions regarding the undertaking and business of the partnership in accordance with the partnership agreement and applicable laws there is no board of directors of the partnership 

original equipment manufacturers or oems or their contract manufacturers and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems we also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors including avnet inc 

the demand for our products has been affected in the past and is likely to continue to be affected in the future by various factors including the following 

 uncertainty in global economic conditions poses significant risks to our business for example customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news which would in turn adversely affect product demand and our results of operations 

fiscal year highlights 

highlights during fiscal year 2017  include the following 



 recent developments

proposed acquisition of qualcomm incorporated 

on november 6 2017 we announced a proposal to acquire qualcomm incorporated or qualcomm for 7000 per share consisting of 6000 in cash and 1000 in broadcom ordinary shares we stated that the proposal stands whether qualcomm’s pending acquisition of nxp semiconductors nv or nxp is consummated on the thendisclosed terms of 11000 per nxp share or is terminated including the assumption of net debt and giving effect to the pending nxp acquisition the enterprise value of the proposed transaction is approximately 130 billion

on november 2 2017 we announced our intention to initiate a process to change the ultimate parent company of the broadcom group from a singapore company to a us corporation the final form and timing of the redomiciliation has not yet been finalized and may be affected by the implementation of the 2017 tax reform act in addition the redomiciliation is subject to the approval of our shareholders we presently expect that our overall cash tax costs will approximately double as compared to our fiscal year 2017 results due to the redomiciliation and taking in account our initial estimates of the expected effects of the 2017 tax reform act 

acquisitions and divestitures 

the discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 

broadcom corporation 

on february 1 2016 broadcom became the successor to avago and acquired brcm or the broadcom merger in which avago shareholders exchanged their shares on a oneforone basis for newly issued broadcom ordinary shares and brcm shareholders received in aggregate approximately 168 billion  in cash 112 million  broadcom ordinary shares and 23 million  partnership reus in exchange for all shares of brcm common stock par value 00001 per share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the broadcom merger in addition we also paid 137 million  in cash for vested brcm equity awards broadcom also assumed unvested rsus originally granted by brcm and converted them into 6 million  broadcom rsus 

the aggregate consideration for the broadcom merger was approximately 357 billion  we funded the cash portion of the broadcom merger with net proceeds from the issuance of 156 billion in term loans under the 2016 credit agreement that we entered into at the time of closing of the broadcom merger as well as cash on hand of the combined companies the financial results provided in this annual report on form 10k include the results of operations of brcm commencing as of february 1 2016 or the acquisition date 

during fiscal year 2016 we completed the sales of certain noncore brcm businesses for aggregate cash proceeds of 830 million and recognized an aggregate gain of 36 million from the sales 

emulex corporation 

in fiscal year 2015 we acquired emulex corporation or emulex a leader in network connectivity monitoring and management for a purchase price of 587 million  

net revenue 

substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products as well as from modules switches and subsystems our four reportable segments are wired infrastructure wireless communications enterprise storage and industrial  other which align with our target markets applications for our products in these segments include enterprise and data center networking home connectivity settop boxes broadband access telecommunication equipment mobile handsets and base stations data center servers and storage systems factory automation power generation and alternative energy systems and electronic displays 

our overall net revenue as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments has varied from quarter to quarter due largely to fluctuations in endmarket demand including the effects of seasonality which are discussed in detail below under “seasonality” 

we use distributors for a significant portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances we also sell products directly to oems and other end customers many of which also purchase product from our distributors and who direct contract manufacturers to purchase product from us historically a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue sales to distributors accounted for 28  and 30  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively direct sales to foxconn technology group companies including hon hai precision industries together referred to as foxconn accounted for 14  of our net 

revenue for both fiscal years 2017  and 2016  we believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers through all channels accounted for more than 40  of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017  and more than 30  for fiscal year 2016  we believe aggregate sales to apple inc through all channels accounted for more than 20  of our net revenue for fiscal year 2017  and approximately 15  for fiscal year 2016  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods the loss of or significant decrease in demand from any of our top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time some of our key customers place large orders or delay orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly this is particularly true in our wireless communications segment as fluctuations may be magnified by the launches of and seasonal variations in sales of mobile handsets as well as changes in the overall economic environment 

in recent years approximately 50 of our net revenue has come from sales to distributors oems or contract manufacturers located in china however the end customers for our products or for the end products into which our products are incorporated are frequently located in countries other than china as a result we believe that a substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product to end customers located in china 

costs and expenses 

total cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials and the cost of assembly and testing of those products cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations including sharebased compensation expense and related occupancy computer services and equipment costs manufacturing quality order fulfillment warranty and inventory adjustments including writedowns for inventory obsolescence energy costs other manufacturing expenses and acquisitionrelated costs acquisitionrelated costs include direct transaction costs and integrationrelated costs total cost of products sold also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges 

although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 

research and development research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies including sharebased compensation expense these expenses also include project material costs thirdparty fees paid to consultants prototype development expense allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process

provision for income taxes we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment for example we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board an agency of the government of singapore which provide that qualifying 

income we earn in singapore is subject to tax holiday or reduced rates of singapore income tax subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments the singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire at various dates generally between 2020 and 2021  subject in certain cases to potential extensions which we may or may not be able to obtain absent such tax incentives the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17  we also have tax holidays on our qualifying income in malaysia which are scheduled to expire between 2018 and 2028 the tax incentives that we have negotiated are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits depending on the incentive at issue we could also be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  the effect of all these tax incentives was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately 237 million  169 million  and 207 million  respectively 

our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences which would increase our expenses reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows in addition taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’s length basis due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities as well as lack of adequate treatybased protection transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could if successful substantially increase our income tax expense 

on november 2 2017 we announced our intention to initiate a process to change the ultimate parent company of the broadcom group from a singapore company to a us corporation we would expect our overall cash tax costs to approximately double as compared to our fiscal year 2017 results due to the redomiciliation and taking in account our initial estimates of the effects of the 2017 tax reform act 

going forward our overall cash tax costs will vary based on a variety of factors in addition to the impact caused by the redomiciliation of our ultimate parent company from singapore to the us including reorganizations or restructurings of our businesses or assets overall profitability the jurisdictional mix of income before income taxes and changes in tax regulations or policy and discrete events such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time our actual effective tax costs and overall effective rate may vary from our expectations and that variance may be material in particular we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside our country of domicile during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods our historical provision for income taxes is not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult subjective or complex judgments by management those policies include revenue recognition business combinations valuation of longlived assets intangible assets and goodwill inventory valuation income taxes retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions sharebased compensation and employee bonus programs see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms to date actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates however because of the inherent nature of estimates there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results we also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded we accrue 100 of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and 

will not be paid thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net revenue and net income in subsequent periods 

business combinations  accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed restructuring liabilities preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on histor ical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales customer contracts and acquired technologies expected costs to develop inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

valuation of goodwill and longlived assets we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment to review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances considers various macroeconomic industryspecific and companyspecific factors those factors include i severe adverse industry or economic trends ii significant companyspecific actions including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations iii current historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance or iv a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value after assessing the totality of events and circumstances if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no further assessment is performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues operating expenses and taxes as well as working capital and capital asset requirements these estimates are developed as part of our longterm planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weightedaverage cost of capital as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows the market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash and debt 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including purchased inprocess research and development assets property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or iii significant negative industry or economic trends the process of evaluating the potential impairment of longlived assets under the accounting guidance on property plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment in order to estimate the fair value of longlived assets we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the longlived asset relates to consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years based on these assumptions and estimates we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the longlived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as the real estate market industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 

inventory valuation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand in addition our industry is characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand additionally our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold therefore although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 

income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances if we determine in the future that a valuation allowance is required such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made conversely if we determine in the future a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the morelikelythannot threshold for recognition 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes and interest will be due if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed a further charge to tax expense would be required if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 

retirement and postretirement benefit plan assumptions retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and postretirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to us based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap one critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs other important assumptions include the expected longterm return on plan assets the health care cost trend rate expected future salary increases expected future increases to benefit payments expected retirement dates employee turnover retiree mortality rates and portfolio composition we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 

the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates — october 29 2017  and october 30 2016  for both us and nonus plans in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with highquality corporate bond yields the discount rate for nonus plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yields depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense 

we base our salary increase assumptions on historical experience and future expectations in developing the expected rate of return we consider longterm compound annualized returns based on historical market data historical and expected returns on the various categories of plan assets and the target investment portfolio allocation among debt equity securities and other investments 

actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is the key assumption in calculating us pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of october 29 2017  each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated 41 million impact on the benefit obligations as of october 29 2017  each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption and expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated change of 1 million and 4 million respectively on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2018  

sharebased compensation expense sharebased compensation expense consists of expense for share options and rsus granted to employees and nonemployees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with broadcom employee share purchase plan or espp we recognize compensation expense for timebased options and espp rights based on the estimated grantdate fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using the blackscholes valuation model 

 certain equity awards include both timebased and marketbased conditions and are accounted for as marketbased awards the fair value of these marketbased awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model assumptions utilized in the monte carlo simulation model follow the same methodology as our timebased option awards 

employee bonus programs our employee bonus programs which are overseen by our compensation committee or our board in the case of our chief executive officer provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics in the first fiscal quarter of the year if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated a variable proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100 achievement of the targets and metrics the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100 and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved in subsequent quarters we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year which is subject to approval by our compensation committee may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter

results of operations 

fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016   



net revenue 





our total net revenue increased primarily due to the full year contribution from acquired brcm products in fiscal year 2017  compared to only three quarters in fiscal year 2016  as well as due to strong organic yearoveryear growth 

net revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to the full year contribution from acquired brcm products as well as strong organic yearoveryear growth net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets as well as the full year contribution from acquired brcm products net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to strength in demand for our hard 

disk drive or hdd products   as well as increased demand for our custom solid state drive or ssd controller and server storage and connectivity products the demand for our hdd products was higher in fiscal year 2017 than in fiscal year 2016 due to shortages in the ssd supply chain during fiscal year 2017 

gross margin   

gross margin increased by 2569 million  in fiscal year 2017  gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 48  in fiscal year 2017  from 45  for fiscal year 2016  these increases were primarily attributable to a 1181 million  reduction in acquisition purchase accounting effect on inventory as well as a more favorable product mix partially offset by a 1748 million  increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets resulting from the broadcom merger the 33  increase in net revenue was the primary reason for the increase in gross margin dollars we expect to incur additional amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in future periods as a result of the brocade merger which closed on november 17 2017  and any further acquisitions 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 618 million  or 23  in fiscal year 2017  research and development expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net revenue at 19  and 20  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in research and development expense dollars for fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to a full year of expense resulting from the acquired brcm businesses and higher sharebased compensation expense partially offset by benefits from restructuring actions that we initiated following the broadcom merger sharebased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2017  due to equity awards granted to employees from the acquired brcm businesses as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense decreased 19 million  or 2  in fiscal year 2017  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 4  and 6  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in selling general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2017  was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs   and benefits from restructuring actions that we initiated following the broadcom merger partially offset by higher sharebased compensation expense sharebased compensation expense was higher in fiscal year 2017  due to annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets recognized in operating expenses decreased 109 million  or 6  in fiscal year 2017  due to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets acquired in the broadcom merger we expect to incur additional amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets in future periods as a result of the brocade merger 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses decreased 835 million  or 84  in fiscal year 2017  compared to   fiscal year 2016   primarily due to a decrease in the impairment of inprocess research and development projects  the decrease was also due to lower employee termination costs as the majority of restructuring activities resulting from the broadcom merger were undertaken in fiscal year 2016 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of the brocade merger 

litigation settlements 

 during fiscal year 2017 we incurred 122 million  of litigation charges associated with certain legal settlement agreements 

segment operating results 



operating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to a full year of revenue contributions from acquired brcm products as well as due to strong organic yearoveryear growth partially offset by a full year of research and development expense related to the acquired brcm businesses operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to an increase in our wireless content in handsets as well as the full year contribution from acquired brcm products these increases were partially offset by a full year of research and development expense related to the acquired brcm businesses operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to strength in demand for our hdd products as well as increased demand for our custom ssd controller and server storage connectivity products we expect contributions from the brocade san business to increase operating income in the enterprise storage segment in future periods operating income for the wired infrastructure wireless communications and enterprise storage segments also benefited from lower operating expenses following our restructuring actions operating income from our industrial  other segment increased primarily due to an increase in revenue dollars from our optocoupler products and licensing of intellectual property or ip partially offset by an increase in legal expense 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charges acquisitionrelated costs charges for litigation settlement and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses decreased 1  in fiscal year 2017  primarily due to significant reductions in the purchase accounting effect on inventory and restructuring impairment and disposal charges partially offset by increases in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets and charges for litigation settlement additionally sharebased compensation was higher in fiscal year 2017  due to equity awards granted to employees from the acquired brcm businesses as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values we expect the factors noted above to increase as a result of the brocade merger 

overall operating income also benefited from reductions in operating expenses related to our restructuring actions following the broadcom merger 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense  interest expense was 454 million  and 585 million  for fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively interest expense was higher in fiscal year 2016 due primarily to onetime debtrelated expenses associated with the financing of the broadcom merger we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal year 2018 due to the issuance of the october 2017 senior notes 

loss on extinguishment of debt  during fiscal year 2017  we issued the january 2017 senior notes to refinance all of the term loans outstanding under the 2016 credit agreement we terminated the 2016 credit agreement and the revolving credit facility thereunder in connection with the issuance of the october 2017 senior notes the proceeds of which were used to finance the brocade merger as a result we wrote off 166 million  of outstanding debt issuance costs which were included in loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2016  we made prepayments on our term loan borrowings under the 2016 credit agreement and as a result recognized 123 million  of losses on extinguishment of debt 

other income net other income net was 62 million  and 10 million  in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively other income net for fiscal year 2017 primarily comprised a gain on disposal of assets and interest income 

provision for income taxes  our provisions for income taxes were 35 million  and 642 million  in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax and a discrete expense of 76 million  resulting from entity reorganizations partially offset by the recognition of 273 million  of excess tax benefits from sharebased equity awards that vested or were exercised during fiscal year 2017 and to a lesser extent the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits primarily as a result of audit settlements 

the income tax provision for fiscal year 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in tax associated with our undistributed earnings partially offset by income tax benefits from losses from continuing operations and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements 

at the time we completed the broadcom merger in connection with the allocation of the purchase price we established a deferred tax liability associated with our potential tax liability arising from our planned integration of brcm’s ip which was completed in november 2016 prior to the adoption of the 2017 tax reform act this tax liability will become payable as earnings resulting from this integration of ip are distributed over time however under the 2017 tax reform act we will be required to recognize all of these earnings in our fiscal year 2018 as a deemed repatriation of foreign earnings subject to a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax 

as a result of these events the amount of our income taxes payable could vary materially and consume an increasing amount of our cash in addition our provision for income taxes in future periods is likely to change as a result of the impact of internal restructurings and reorganizations which could also affect our overall effective tax rate 

fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015   



net revenue 





our overall net revenue increased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the contributions from acquired brcm products since the acquisition date as a result of the broadcom merger our wired infrastructure segment constituted our largest segment 

net revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to the contributions since the acquisition date from acquired brcm products included in this segment net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to revenue contributions of approximately 18 billion from sales of acquired brcm wireless connectivity and related products since the acquisition date partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately 525 million in sales of our radio frequency or rf components due to reduced demand from a key north american mobile handset customer net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to the additional revenue resulting from a full year of contributions from the emulex business that we acquired in may 2015 as well as strength in demand for our hdd products partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products net revenue from our industrial  other segment remained essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2015  our net revenue in fiscal year 2016 also included 450 million from development arrangements and sales and licensing of ip compared to 313 million in fiscal year 2015 which primarily benefited our wired infrastructure and industrial  other segments 

gross margin   

gross margin was 59 billion  for fiscal year 2016 compared to 36 billion  for fiscal year 2015 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to contributions to our wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments from the brcm businesses acquired in february 2016 as a percentage of net revenue gross margin was 45  and 52  for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively the 7  decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was largely due to 12 billion  of costs resulting from the stepup of inventory to fair value and the increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets associated with the broadcom merger 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 16 billion  or 155  in fiscal year 2016  research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was 20  and 15  for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively the overall increase in research and development expense dollars and as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to the acquisition of brcm sharebased compensation included in research and development expense increased due to rsus assumed in connection with and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in the broadcom merger as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

selling general and administrative expense 

selling general and administrative expense increased 320 million  or 66  in fiscal year 2016  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 6  and 7  for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively the overall increase in selling general and administrative expense dollars for fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to the impact of the acquired brcm businesses and the acquisitionrelated costs the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due to the realization of synergies resulting from the integration of brcm sharebased compensation included in selling general and administrative expense increased due to rsus assumed in connection with and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in the broadcom merger as well as annual employee equity awards granted at higher grantdate fair values 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

total amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 26 billion  for fiscal year 2016  compared to 733 million  for fiscal year 2015 the increase in amortization expense in fiscal year 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in amortizable intangible assets resulting from the broadcom merger 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges 

restructuring impairment and disposal charges recognized primarily in operating expenses were 11 billion  for fiscal year 2016  compared to 144 million  in fiscal year 2015  the increase was due primarily to the broadcom merger including   impairment charges of 417 million for termination of inprocess research and development projects and 173 million for property plant and equipment restructuring charges were due primarily to employee termination costs of approximately 418 million and lease termination and other exit costs of 29 million primarily resulting from the broadcom merger 

segment operating results 



operating income from our wired infrastructure segment increased primarily due to contributions from the acquired brcm wired products operating income from our wireless communications segment increased primarily due to contributions from the acquired brcm wireless connectivity products partially offset by a decrease in demand for our rf components from a key north american mobile handset customer operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to a full year of contributions from the emulex business that we acquired in may 2015 as well as strength in demand for our hdd products partially offset by a decrease in demand for our server and storage connectivity products operating income from our industrial  other segment was flat 

unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense restructuring impairment and disposal charges acquisitionrelated costs including charges related to the stepup of acquired inventory to fair value and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments unallocated expenses increased 368  in fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to increases in charges related to the stepup of inventory to fair value amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets restructuring impairment and disposal charges and costs incurred in connection with the broadcom merger additionally sharebased compensation increased due to rsus assumed in and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in the broadcom merger 

nonoperating income and expenses 

interest expense  interest expense was 585 million  and 191 million  for fiscal years 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to interest on higher outstanding debt balances and expenses related to debt modification and ticking fees in each case associated with the term loan indebtedness we incurred to finance the broadcom merger 

loss on extinguishment of debt  during fiscal year 2016 in connection with the closing of the broadcom merger we repaid in full our term loan borrowings under a collateralized credit agreement with lenders named therein entered into in fiscal year 2014 or the 2014 credit agreement we subsequently repaid our €900 million term b1 euro loan defined below partially funded by the sale of certain acquired brcm assets that were held for sale we also repaid our 500 million term b2 loan defined below partially funded with 325 million  of additional term a loan defined below borrowings these payments and the august 2016 amendments to the 2016 credit agreement resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 123 million for fiscal year 2016 in fiscal year 2015 we made a 593 million principal prepayment on term loan borrowings under the 2014 credit agreement and settled the 20 convertible senior notes due 2021 which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of 10 million for fiscal year 2015 

in connection with the completion of the broadcom merger three broadcom subsidiaries entered into the 2016 credit agreement which originally provided for a term a loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 44 billion or the term a loan a term b1 dollar loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 98 billion or the term b1 loan a term b1 euro loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of €900 million equivalent to 978 million as of february 1 2016 or the term b1 euro loan a term b2 loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 500 million or the term b2 loan and together 

with the term a loan term b1 loan and term b1 euro loan the 2016 credit agreement also provides for a revolving credit facility or the 2016 revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow from time to time in an aggregate principal amount of up to 500 million for working capital and other corporate purposes including swingline loans of up to 150 million in the aggregate and for the issuance of letters of credit of up to 100 million in the aggregate which in the case of swingline loans and letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the 2016 revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis 

provision for income taxes  for fiscal year 2016  we had a provision for income taxes of 642 million  compared to 76 million  for fiscal year 2015  the income tax provision for fiscal year 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in tax associated with our undistributed earnings partially offset by income tax benefits from losses from continuing operations and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements 

during fiscal year 2016 we determined that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated and current foreign earnings in our operations outside of singapore as a result we made a provision for taxes on 19 billion of our undistributed earnings as of november 1 2015 including projected withholding taxes that would become payable upon the distribution of those earnings and recognized 93 million of expense in fiscal year 2016 related to the undistributed earnings of foreign operations that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested 

at the time we completed the broadcom merger in connection with the preliminary allocation of the purchase price we established a deferred tax liability that was associated with our potential tax liability arising from our planned integration of brcm’s ip which was completed in november 2016 this tax liability will become payable as earnings resulting from this integration of ip are distributed over time 

seasonality 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half primarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications segment this segment has historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufactured by our oem customers however from time to time typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems particularly in the wireless communications segment we have a diversified business portfolio and our wired infrastructure segment represents the largest portion of our net revenue we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of the diversification of our business portfolio 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 

our primary sources of liquidity as of october 29 2017  consisted of i 11204 million  in cash and cash equivalents which included 3980 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the october 2017 senior notes all of which was used to fund the brocade merger on november 17 2017 and ii cash we expect to generate from operations in addition we may also generate cash from the sale of assets from time to time 

during fiscal year 2017 we completed the issuances and sales of the january 2017 senior notes and october 2017 senior notes collectively the senior notes in aggregate principal amounts of 13550 million  and 4000 million  respectively 

during fiscal year 2017 we also entered into a trade accounts receivable factoring facility with a thirdparty financial institution to sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis for amounts of up to 100 million from time to time total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreement were 178 million  during fiscal year 2017  

our shortterm and longterm liquidity requirements primarily arise from i business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time ii working capital requirements iii research and development and capital expenditure needs iv interim cash dividend payments by broadcom if and when declared by the board v cash distributions by the partnership if and when declared by the partnership’s general partner vi interest and principal payments related to outstanding indebtedness vii payment of income taxes including taxes resulting from intercompany transfers of ip and viii funding employee benefit plan obligations our ability to fund these requirements will depend in part on our future cash flows which are determined by our future operating performance and therefore subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial business and other factors some of which are beyond our control 

our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 were higher than fiscal year 2016 due primarily to expenditures for construction at our irvine and san jose campuses purchases of test manufacturing equipment and spending on equipment to support various research and development projects we expect capital expenditures to be somewhat lower in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 

our liquidity needs also increased as a result of completing the brocade merger we financed 4000 million  of the purchase consideration with the issuance of the october 2017 senior notes we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient liquidity after giving effect to the brocade merger to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months excluding the impact of any future mergers acquisitions and divestiture activity 

from time to time we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of or investments in businesses technologies and product lines any such transaction or evaluation of potential transactions could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions we could also reduce certain expenditures such as payment of our cash dividend if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities including acquisitions or unanticipated capital expenditures our business and financial condition could suffer in such circumstances we may also seek to obtain new debt or equity financing however we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to service the senior notes and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 

we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above 

summary and highlights 

our cash and cash equivalents increased 8107 million  to 11204 million  at october 29 2017  from 3097 million  at october 30 2016  

the increase was largely due to the following 

 the increase was partially offset by the following 

 dividendsdistributions 

dividends paid by broadcom 



distributions made by the partnership 



cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities represents net income loss adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities the 3140 million  increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was due to the impact of net income and adjustments to net income for noncash items partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities the adjustments to net income for noncash items were higher compared to fiscal year 2016  primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization increased sharebased compensation and an increase in the noncash portion of the debt extinguishment loss partially offset by a decrease in noncash restructuring impairment and disposal charges and a decrease in deferred taxes and other noncash taxes 

the 1093 million  increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  was due to the adjustments to net loss for noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities partially offset by the impact of a net loss during fiscal year 2016  the adjustments to net loss for noncash items were higher compared to fiscal year 2015  primarily due to depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation noncash restructuring impairment and disposal charges and deferred taxes and other noncash taxes 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash used for capital expenditures acquisitions and investments partially offset by proceeds from disposals of property plant and equipment divestitures and maturities of investments the 9166 million  change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due to 10055 million  paid primarily for the broadcom merger in fiscal year 2016 and cash receipts of 441 million  from the sale of our irvine campus in fiscal year 2017 offset in part by a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses and an increase in capital expenditures and investments 

the 9599 million  change in investing cash flows for fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily due to 10055 million  paid primarily for the broadcom merger and an increase in capital expenditures and investments partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses and an increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 

financing activities 

broadcom 

cash provided by used in financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds and payments related to our longterm debt payment of assumed debt dividend payments by broadcom cash distributions by the partnership proceeds received from the issuances of ordinary shares pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans and payments of debt issuance costs the 5474 million  decrease in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016  was primarily due a decrease in net proceeds and payments related to our longterm debt and an increase in dividend and distribution payments offset in part by the repayment of assumed debt in fiscal year 2016 

the 9563 million  increase in financing cash flows for fiscal year 2016  compared to fiscal year 2015  was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds and payments related to our longterm debt partially offset by an increase in dividend and distribution payments 

the partnership 

cash provided by used in financing activities for the partnership is materially the same as for broadcom discussed above the differences are due to capital transactions with the general partner which result from capital contributions and distributions between broadcom and the partnership 

indebtedness 

see note 8 “borrowings” included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

senior notes 

on january 19 2017 we completed the issuance and sale of the january 2017 senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 13550 million  the net proceeds together with cash on hand were used to repay all of the outstanding term loans under the 2016 credit agreement in the aggregate amount of 13555 million  

on october 17 2017 we completed the issuance and sale of the october 2017 senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of 4000 million  the net proceeds together with cash on hand were used to finance the brocade merger which closed on november 17 2017 in connection with the issuance of the october 2017 senior notes we terminated the commitments and satisfied all outstanding obligations under the 2016 credit agreement 

as a result during fiscal year   2017  we wroteoff 166 million  of debt issuance costs which were included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations 

contractual commitments 



debt principal and interest represents principal and interest on borrowings under the senior notes and outstanding senior unsecured notes that we assumed as a result of the broadcom merger or the assumed senior notes 

purchase commitments represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services primarily inventory that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with the internal fabrication facility expansion and construction of our new campuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and therefore cancelable purchase orders for these capital expenditures are included in the table above 

other contractual commitments represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to it human resources financial infrastructure outsourcing services and other service agreements 

operating lease obligations represents real property and equipment leased from third parties under noncancelable operating leases 

capital lease obligations  represents equipment leased from third parties under noncancelable capital leases 

pension plan contributions  represents our planned minimum contributions to our pension plans although additional future contributions will be required the amount and timing of these contributions will be affected by actuarial assumptions the actual rate of returns on plan assets the level of market interest rates legislative changes and the amount of voluntary contributions to the plans the amount shown in the table represents our planned contributions to our pension plans within a year because any contributions for fiscal year 2019  and later will depend on the value of the plan assets in the future and thus are uncertain we have not included any amounts for fiscal year 2019  and beyond in the above table 

due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at october 29 2017  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 1011 million  of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of october 29 2017 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements at october 29 2017  as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk under the exchange act
