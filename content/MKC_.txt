our flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach other competitors include large publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature but which also tend to focus on providing integrated solutions extending beyond flavor through the use of other functional and nutritional ingredients 

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products pepper capsicums red peppers and paprika onion vanilla garlic and salt pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced locally either within the united states or from our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program 

in addition we rely on thirdparty transportation providers to deliver raw materials as well as our product to our customers reduced availability of transportation capacity due to labor shortages primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers 

customers 

our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers wholesalers and distributors in the consumer segment products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels including grocery mass merchandise warehouse clubs discount and drug stores and ecommerce in the flavor solutions segment products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items as well as provided to their own customers for use in dinein and takeout eating occasions all to enhance the flavor of their foods customers for the flavor solutions segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied through a variety of channels including directly and indirectly through distributors wholesale foodservice suppliers and ecommerce

risks related to our company business and operations 

a pandemic including covid19 could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our industry as a result of changes in consumer behavior retailer inventory levels cost inflation manufacturing and supply chain disruption and overall macroeconomic conditions the extent and nature of government actions including limitations on crowd size closures of dinein restaurants and bars and significant restrictions on travel as well as work restrictions that prohibited many employees from going to work varied during fiscal 2020 and 2021 based upon the thencurrent extent and severity of the covid19 pandemic within the respective countries and localities although our consumer business has benefited from increased athome consumption due to restrictions related to covid19 our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on consumer purchasing behavior the covid19 mitigation measures impacting certain of our flavor solutions customers have included the following i with respect to dinein restaurants closures limitations on dinein capacity or restrictions on the operations of those restaurants to carryout or delivery only and ii with respect to quick service restaurants limitations on operations to drivethrough pickup or delivery the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of covid19 however with the spread of the covid19 variants the ongoing implications of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to 

• significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products which may be caused by among other things the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness quarantine or other travel restrictions or financial hardship shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products or stockpiling or similar activity if prolonged such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

• inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components transportation enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols or other manufacturing and distribution capability 

• failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors commercial banks joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to the company or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations or 

• significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture sell or distribute our products including quarantines importexport restrictions price controls or governmental or regulatory actions closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our thirdparty partners suppliers or customers from sufficiently staffing operations including operations necessary for the production distribution sale and support of our products which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus the emergence and spread of variants infection rates in areas where we operate the extent and effectiveness of containment actions including the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where we operate the impact of actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers and suppliers should these conditions persist for a prolonged period including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors  any of which could have a material effect on us 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers reevaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products in the event that we are unable to supply our products to customers in the time frame and quantities that they desire whether due to increased demand or other factors our customers may discontinue all or a portion of their purchases from us and source competitive brands if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged additionally certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to governmentimposed actions we have and may continue to become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation consumer behaviors and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may impact our financial condition or results of operations 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing such as the emergence of new sales channels like ecommerce and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business the trend towards ecommerce and its impact of consumer habits and preferences has accelerated since the onset of the covid19 pandemic in many of the markets we serve and our financial results may be impacted if we are unable to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics in addition our flavor solutions segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our flavor solutions segment declines these factors could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 22 of our consolidated sales in 2021 the loss of either of these large customers due to events beyond our control or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions climate change market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control including the covid19 pandemic the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper capsicums red peppers and paprika onion vanilla garlic and salt while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our cci program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business 

our ability to make move and sell products is critical to our success damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather climate change natural disaster fire terrorism cyberattack pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic governmental restrictions or mandates strikes importexport restrictions or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location the failure of third parties on which we rely including those third parties who supply our ingredients packaging capital equipment and other necessary operating materials contract manufacturers commercial transport distributors contractors and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so may negatively impact our operations our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is manufactured from a single location could adversely affect our business and results of operations as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain 

moreover short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages turnover and labor cost increases 

labor is a primary component of operating our business a number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs including high unemployment levels federal unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic and other government regulations we are also experiencing and may continue to experience additional pressure in our supply chain due to labor shortages and absenteeism associated with covid19 together with the impact of the continued elevated demand a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a highlevel or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability such as overtime and thirdparty outsourcing have negative effects our business could be adversely affected in addition we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers an overall labor shortage 

lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor inflation caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

we may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs such as raw and packaging materials labor and distribution costs which may impact our financial condition or results of operations 

as a manufacturer and distributor of flavor products we rely on raw materials packaging materials plant labor distribution resources and transportation providers in 2021 and the early part of 2022 the costs of raw materials packaging materials labor energy fuel transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased in addition many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to market conditions demand for raw materials weather growing and harvesting conditions climate change energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmental actions import and export requirements including tariffs and other factors beyond our control although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022 we also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022 

our attempts to offset these cost pressures such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products may not be successful higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn to the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected furthermore we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic or pandemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we 

may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our results 

as of november 30 2021 we had approximately 53 billion of goodwill and approximately 35 billion of other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of those assets to their carrying values if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to their implied fair value or fair value respectively factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions higher income tax rates or assumed royalty rates the impairment of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 

because indefinitelived intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition of the related business indefinitelived intangible assets associated with recent business acquisitions particularly those acquired in recent low interest rate environments such as cholula and fona are more susceptible to impairment in periods of rising interest rates than indefinitelived intangible assets related to businesses acquired in periods of higher interest rates 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions and exit certain businesses or lines of business these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty and mexican peso as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling and australian dollar and finally the canadian dollar versus british pound sterling we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the ongoing effects of the decision by british voters to exit the european union may negatively impact our operations 

on january 1 2021 the euuk trade and cooperation agreement the euuk trade deal took effect the euuk trade deal was formally approved by the european union legislature on april 28 2021 while the euuk trade deal has removed uncertainty and a significant amount of financial risk associated with the uk’s exit from the european union we are still assessing its details and related impact on our uk business and other operations we believe that the new trading relationship between the uk and the european union will result in increased costs of goods imported into the uk from the european union and exported from the uk into the european union the movement of goods between the uk and the european union will continue to be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure also there will be additional costs related to goods that are deemed to originate outside of the uk or european union and for which the originating country has no trade agreement with the uk our ability to increase pricing of our products in light of increased costs is uncertain and to the extent we are unable to fully do so our profitability will decline 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials scientific consensus shows that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products as a result of climate change we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

esg issues including those related to climate change and sustainability may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their esg policies if we are unable to meet our esg goals or evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and standards or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor and our reputation business or financial condition may be adversely affected increased focus and activism on esg topics may hinder our access to capital as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our esg practices in particular these constituencies are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change water use deforestation plastic waste and other sustainability concerns changing consumer preferences may result in increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse and nonrecyclable plastic packaging and other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients or increased consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products these demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands 

in addition to environmental issues these constituencies are also focused on social and other governance issues including matters such as but not limited to human capital and social issues we also have established diversity equity and inclusion goals as part of our esg initiative our initiatives also extend from individuals to entire communities including those we serve and just as importantly those from which we source 

concern over climate change including plastics and packaging materials in particular may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements increased regulatory requirements related to environmental causes and related esg disclosure rules may result in increased compliance costs or increased costs of energy raw materials or compliance with emissions standards which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products 

or an increase in operating costs any failure to achieve our esg goals or a perception whether or not valid of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environmental human capital or social issues or to effectively respond to new or changes in legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other esg matters or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase risk of litigation 

risks relating to credit and capital markets our credit rating borrowings and dividends 

increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us 

on november 30 2021 we had total outstanding variable rate debt of approximately 613 million including 539 million of shortterm borrowings at a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 02 the interest rates under our revolving credit facility can vary based on our credit ratings our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital 

our credit ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

we may incur additional indebtedness to finance our acquisitions that may limit our ability to among other matters issue additional indebtedness meet our debt service requirements react to rising interest rates comply with certain covenants and compete with less highly leveraged competitors 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as of november 30 2021 the indebtedness of mccormick and its subsidiaries is approximately 53 billion this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 

• increasing our debt service obligations making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds 

• increasing our exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates 

• subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants the noncompliance with which could result in an event of default 

• increasing our vulnerability to and reducing our flexibility to respond to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes including funding of acquisitions if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facility during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the uncertainty regarding the planned phaseout of libor may negatively impact our operating results 

libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility synthetic lease interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out beginning after december 31 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate without this data libor may no longer be published or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market on march 5 2021 the uk financial conduct authority fca published a statement confirming that all libor settings will either cease to be provided or no longer be representative i immediately after december 31 2021 in the case of all sterling euro swiss franc and japanese yen settings and the 1week and 2month us dollar settings and ii immediately after june 30 2023 in the case of all remaining us dollar settings the international swaps and derivative association isda or alternative reference rates committee arrc fallback spread adjustments were fixed as of the fca announcement date and are expected to be implemented at the point each relevant reference rate ceases or becomes nonrepresentative 

there continue to be many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the referenced rate and how this will impact the company’s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments the company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the arrc the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results 

the declaration payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors 

the declaration payment and amount of any dividends is made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant including our financial position results of operations available cash resources cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders our dividend payments are subject to solvency conditions established by the maryland general corporation law accordingly there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our board of directors will not decide to reduce suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future 

risks related to intellectual property information technology and cybersecurity 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and 

the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business we rely on our information technology systems some of which are or may be managed or hosted by or outsourced to third party service providers to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems and infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades or oversee third party service providers our business or financial results could be negatively impacted the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction or reporting errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems and the systems of our customers vendors suppliers and other thirdparty service providers are subject to cyberattacks or other security incidents including computer viruses or other malicious codes phishing attacks ransomware or other service disruptions or other system or process failures such incidents could result in unauthorized access to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data as well as disruptions to operations we and the thirdparties we do business with have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and attacks although to date none has been material to address the risks to our information technology systems and data we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology developing security policies and procedures implementing and assessing the effectiveness of controls monitoring and routine testing of our information systems conducting risk assessments of third party service providers and designing business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however cyberthreats are constantly evolving are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes and functions which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident it may have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and we may experience other adverse consequences such as loss of assets remediation costs litigation regulatory investigations and the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event 

if we are not able to successfully implement our business transformation initiative or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted 

we continue to implement our multiyear business transformation initiative to execute significant change to our global processes capabilities and operating model including in our global enablement ge organization in order to provide a scalable platform for future growth while reducing costs as technology provides the backbone for greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we are also making investments in our information systems including the multiyear program to replace our enterprise resource planning erp system currently underway which includes the transformation of our financial processing systems to enterprisewide systems solutions these systems implementations are part of our ongoing business transformation initiative and we plan to implement these systems throughout all parts of our businesses if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of our business which could result in the loss of customers and revenue in 

addition failure to either deliver the applications on time due to operational limitations caused by covid19 or otherwise or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue in connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls including our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting 

we utilize cloudbased services and systems and networks managed by thirdparty vendors to process transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees customers vendors and other third parties our utilization of these cloudbased services and systems will increase as we implement our business transformation initiatives if any of these thirdparty service providers or vendors do not perform effectively or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance including compliance with servicelevel agreements or regulatory or legal requirements we may not be able to achieve expected cost savings we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation which could have a negative impact on employee morale in addition the management of multiple thirdparty service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control 

risks related to our global business litigation laws and regulations 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacturing storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment consumer protection competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification customs and trade laws including the import and export of products and product ingredients employment and health and safety enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

in addition there are various compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals including such obligations required by the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr which came into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act ccpa which came into effect in january 2020 these types of data privacy laws create a range of compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals and increases financial penalties for noncompliance for example the ccpa imposes requirements on companies that do business in california and collect personal information from customers including notice consent and service provider requirements the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements as well as a private right of action for data breaches further in november 2020 the california privacy rights act “cpra” was passed into law and goes into full effect on january 1 2023 with a ‘lookback’ to january 1 2022 the cpra builds on the ccpa and among other things requires the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate privacy issues in 2021 virginia and colorado adopted laws which will take effect on january 1 2023 and july 1 2023 respectively introducing new privacy obligations which may require us to develop additional compliance mechanisms and processes as a company that is subject to data privacy laws we bear the costs of compliance with them including the gdpr and us state laws and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of these laws which continue to evolve these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

our international and crossborder operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2021 approximately 40 of our sales were generated in countries other than the us our international operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties several countries within the european union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union and the uk additionally sales in countries other than the us together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the us are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

the global nature of our business changes in tax legislation and the resolution of tax uncertainties create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of international subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment from the perspective of management mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information — more fully described below under the caption nongaap financial measures — that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data on november 30 2020 the company effected a twoforone stock split in the form of a stock dividend on all shares of the company’s two classes of common stock on november 30 2020 one like share was issued for each share outstanding to shareholders of record as of november 20 2020 all common stock and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor we manufacture market and distribute spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food and beverage industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and flavor solutions as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 and increase adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 

covid19 – as a result of the covid19 pandemic governments around the world either recommended or mandated actions to slow the transmission of the virus that included shelterinplace orders quarantines limitations on crowd size closures of dinein restaurants and bars and significant restrictions on travel as well as work restrictions that prohibited many employees from going to work uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has significantly impacted not only our operating results but also the global economy the extent and nature of government actions varied during the years ended november 30 2021 and 2020 based upon the thencurrent extent and severity of the covid19 pandemic within their respective countries and localities 

we continue to actively monitor the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business the effects of covid19 on consumer behavior have impacted the relative balance of athome versus awayfromhome food demand the impact of covid19 on our consumer segment since the beginning of the pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in athome consumption and related demand for our products in 2021 our flavor solutions segment benefited from a recovery in awayfromhome eating that more than offset the net sales declines experienced in 2020 as a result of restrictions imposed to reduce the spread of covid19 the covid19 mitigation measures in 2020 impacting certain of our flavor solutions customers included the following i with respect to dinein restaurants closures limitations on dinein capacity or restrictions on the operations of those restaurants to carryout or delivery only and ii with respect to quick service restaurants limitations on operations to drivethrough pickup or delivery although certain restrictive measures were reinstated during certain periods of 2021 the prevalence and scale of closures and operating limitations were less severe as compared to 2020 for comparative purposes the following provides a summary of growth in net sales as reported and on a constant currency basis for the year ended 2021 as compared to 2019 

 the percentage change in reported net sales and the percentage change on a constant currency basis were 

favorably impacted by the acquisitions of cholula and fona which in aggregate contributed 26 71 and 43 to the consumer segment flavor solutions segment and total net sales growth rates respectively in the preceding table on both a reported and constant currency basis 

in early fiscal 2021 vaccines effective in combating covid19 were approved by health agencies in certain countriesregions in which we operate including the us uk european union canada and mexico and began to be administered the availability of covid19 vaccines and their acceptance by individuals is difficult to predict and vaccination levels vary across jurisdictions the pace and shape of the covid19 recovery as well as the impact and extent of covid19 variants or potential resurgences is not presently known these and other uncertainties with respect to covid19 could result in changes to our current expectations in addition to a number of adverse impacts to our business including but not limited to additional disruption to the economy and consumers’ willingness and ability to spend temporary or permanent closures by businesses that consume our products such as restaurants additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable or in the case of significant increased demand for our product we may be unable to fulfill that increased demand as a result it may be challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support our business needs and individuals could become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions also governments may impose other laws regulations or taxes related to covid19 which could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us the potential effects of covid19 also could impact us in a number of other ways including but not limited to variations in the level of our profitability laws and regulations affecting our business fluctuations in foreign currency markets the availability of future borrowings the cost of borrowings valuation of our pension assets and obligations credit risks of our customers and counterparties and potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets 

inflationary cost environment and supply chain disruption – during fiscal 2021 we experienced inflationary cost increases in our commodities packaging materials and transportation costs we expect that these inflationary cost increases will continue but we expect they will be partially mitigated by pricing actions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 those that we plan to implement in fiscal 2022 and by our comprehensive continuous improvement cci programled cost savings during fiscal 2021 we also experienced additional pressure in our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity as well as due to labor shortages and absenteeism associated with covid19 together with the impact of the continued elevated demand in response to these supply chain pressures we have taken actions build capacity as well as increase our supply chain related resources we expect these pressures to continue in 2022 

sales growth  over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business – driven by brand marketing support category management and differentiated customer engagement 2 new products and 3 acquisitions 

base business – we expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed quality and effectiveness we measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support through digital marketing we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes provide cooking advice and help them discover new products 

new products – for our consumer segment we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition including private label we are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion from gourmet premium items to convenient and valuepriced flavors 

for flavor solutions customers we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products as well as flavors for new menu items we have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions products aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans many of which include cleanlabel organic natural and “betterforyou” innovation with over 20 product innovation centers around the world we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers 

acquisitions – acquisitions are expected to approximate onethird of our sales growth over time since the beginning of 2017 we have completed four acquisitions which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments we focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health geographically our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets information with respect to our three most recent acquisitions is provided below 

• on december 30 2020 we acquired fona international llc and certain of its affiliates fona a privately owned company for approximately 708 million net of cash acquired we financed this fiscal 2021 acquisition with cash and shortterm borrowings fona is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food beverage and nutritional markets which expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories as well as extends our technology platform strengthens our capabilities and accelerates the strategic migration of our portfolio to more valueadded and technically insulated products 

• on november 30 2020 we acquired the parent company of cholula hot sauce® cholula from l catterton for approximately 801 million net of cash acquired cholula is a strong addition to mccormick’s global branded flavor portfolio which broadens the company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic mexican flavor hot sauce in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments 

• on august 17 2017 we acquired reckitt benckisers food division rb foods for approximately 42 billion the acquired iconic brands of rb foods included french’s® frank’s redhot® and cattlemen’s® which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio we believe that these additions moved us to a leading position in the attractive us condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments 

the fona and cholula acquisitions contributed approximately onethird of our sales growth in 2021 

cost savings and business transformation  we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

we are making investments to build the mccormick of the future including in our global enablement ge organization to transform mccormick through globally aligned innovative services to enable growth as more fully described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements we expect to incur special charges of approximately 60 million to 65 million associated with our ge initiative of which approximately 407 million have been recognized through november 30 2021 as technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we are also making investments in our information systems from late 2018 through early 2020 we progressed in implementing our global enterprise resource planning erp replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we elected to pause activity related to our erp for the balance of fiscal 2020 due in part to covid19 restrictions that restricted necessary travel by internal and external erp team members and made it difficult for local mccormick personnel to actively participate in the erp development data cleansing and testing prior to then scheduled pilots later in fiscal 2020 during fiscal 2021 we resumed activities related to our erp replacement program 

we expect that in total over the course of the erp replacement program from late 2018 through 2025 we will invest approximately 400 million including expenses related to the golive activities in our operations to enable the anticipated completion of the global roll out of our new information technology platform in 2024 of that projected 400 million we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 50 and program expenses to account for approximately 50 of the approximately 200 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending related to our erp replacement program approximately 85 million has been recognized through november 30 2021 of the approximately 200 million of capitalized software included in our projected total spending related to our erp program approximately 115 million has been recognized through november 30 2021 

the ge initiative is expected to generate annual savings ranging from approximately 45 million to 55 million once all actions are implemented including those that are dependent on the replacement of our global erp platform 

cash flow  we continue to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was 8283 million 10413 million and 9468 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2021 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 36 years and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2021 the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was 3719 million 

operating results  on a longterm basis we expect a combination of acquisitions share repurchases and debt repayments and the resulting impact on interest expense to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2021 we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 128 over the 2020 level due to the following factors 

• we grew volume and product mix which added 55 of sales growth exclusive of acquisitions this growth was driven by increases in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments increased net sales within our consumer segment was driven by strong demand due to a sustained shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation which was first seen in 2020 as a response to actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid19 increased net sales within our flavor solutions segment was principally driven by sales of awayfromhome products as compared to 2020 when actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid19 significantly impacted demand 

• pricing actions contributed 08 of the increase in net sales 

• acquisitions contributed 41 of the increase in net sales 

• net sales growth was positively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that increased sales growth by 24 excluding this impact we grew sales by 104 over the prior year on a constant currency basis 

operating income was 10151 million in 2021 and 9995 million in 2020 we recorded 511 million and 69 million of special charges in 2021 and 2020 respectively related to organization and streamlining actions special charges in 2021 included 47 million in cost of goods sold related the exit of a low margin business in 2021 and 2020 we also recorded 353 million and 124 million of transaction and integration expenses respectively related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona that reduced operating income in 2021 compared to the yearago period the favorable impact of higher sales 1170 million of cost savings from our cci program including organization and streamlining actions and lower incentivebased compensation more than offset the impact of increased commodity packaging materials and transportation costs higher conversion costs which include costs associated with covid19 and increased brand marketing costs excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona adjusted operating income was 11015 million in 2021 an increase of 81 compared to 10188 million in the yearago period in constant currency adjusted operating income rose 62 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see the subsequent discussion under the heading nongaap financial measures 

diluted earnings per share was 280 in 2021 and 278 in 2020 the yearonyear increase in earnings per share was primarily driven by higher operating income special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by 030 and 005 in 2021 and 2020 respectively a gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation increased earnings per share by 005 in 2021 excluding the effects of special charges transaction and integration expenses and the gain realized from the sale of an unconsolidated operation adjusted diluted earnings per share was 305 in 2021 and 283 in 2020 or an increase of 78 

2022 outlook 

in 2022 we expect to grow net sales over the 2021 level by 3 to 5 which includes an estimated 1 unfavorable impact from currency rates or 4 to 6 on a constant currency basis that anticipated 2022 sales growth includes the impact of pricing actions including those taken in 2021 to partially offset cost increases we expect the impact of pricing to be a significant driver of our sales growth we expect volume and product mix to be impacted by pricing elasticities although at a lower level than we have experienced historically we anticipate that our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the exit of a lower margin product line in late 2021 

we expect our 2022 gross profit margin to range from an increase of 20 basis points to a decline of 30 basis points from our gross profit margin of 395 in 2021 the projected 2022 change in gross profit margin is principally due to the net effect of i a midteen percentage impact of inflation in 2022 compared to 2021 ii the favorable impact of pricing actions in response to increased commodity packaging materials and transportation costs iii anticipated unfavorable sales mix in 2022 between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2021 iv the favorable impact of anticipated cci cost savings and v the lack of 110 million of transaction and integration expenses and special charges reflected in cost of goods sold in 2021 we expect our 2022 gross profit margin excluding the 110 million of transaction and integration expenses and special charges in 2021 to range from comparable to a decline of 50 basis points from our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin of 397 

in 2022 we expect an increase in operating income of 13 to 15 which includes an estimated 1 unfavorable impact from currency rates over the 2021 level our cciled cost savings target in 2022 is approximately 85 million we anticipate integration expenses related to the fona acquisition of approximately 3 million to favorably impact operating income in 2022 as compared to 353 million of transaction and integration expenses in 2021 we also expect approximately 30 million of special charges in 2022 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions in 2021 special charges were 511 million excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses we expect 2022’s adjusted operating income to increase by 7 to 9 which includes an estimated 1 unfavorable impact from currency rates or to increase by 8 to 10 on a constant currency basis over the 2021 level 

our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2022 than in 2021 we estimate that our 2022 effective tax rate including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items will be 22 to 23 as compared to 215 in 2021 excluding projected taxes associated with special charges and transaction and integration expenses we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will be 22 to 23 in 2022 as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 201 in 2021 

diluted earnings per share was 280 in 2021 diluted earnings per share for 2022 is projected to range from 307 to 312 excluding the per share impact of i special charges of 016 ii transaction and integration expenses including the unfavorable impact of a discrete tax item of 004 related to our acquisition of fona of 014 and iii the gain realized upon our sale of an unconsolidated operation of 005 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 305 in 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of 009 and from integration expenses of 001 is projected to range from 317 to 322 in 2022 we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow by 4 to 6 which includes a 1 unfavorable impact from currency rates or to grow by 5 to 7 on a constant currency basis over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 305 in 2021 

results of operations—2021 compared to 2020 

sales for 2021 increased by 128 from 2020 and by 104 on a constant currency basis that 128 sales increase was driven by higher sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments on a consolidated basis higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 55 while pricing actions which were primarily taken in the fourth quarter added 08 to sales that net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by continued levels of strong demand within our consumer segment as the shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation first seen in 2020 as a response to actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid19 has persisted in addition our flavor solutions segment volume increased principally due to a recovery in demand for awayfromhome products including higher sales to our branded food service customers as compared to 2020 sales were also impacted by favorable foreign currency rates that increased net sales 24 compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 104 on a constant currency basis 

in 2021 our gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 395 from 411 in 2020 the decline was driven by the impact of increased commodity packaging materials and transportation costs higher conversion costs which includes costs associated with covid19 and a less favorable mix in sales between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2020 these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by savings from our cci program pricing actions improved product mix and the accretive impact of the cholula and fona acquisitions each as compared to the prior year period in addition our 2021 gross profit margin was burdened by i 63 million of transaction expense representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of cholula and fona upon our sale of those acquired inventories and ii a noncash special charge of 47 million 

associated with the exit of a low margin business in our asiapacific region excluding the transaction expense and special charges adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 140 basis points from 411 in 2020 to 397 for the year ended november 30 2021 

selling general and administrative sga expense was 14041 million in 2021 compared to 12816 million in 2020 an increase of 1225 million that increase in sga expense was primarily a result of i sga associated with the cholula and fona acquisitions ii greater selling and distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume and iii increased brand marketing costs all as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 those increases were partially offset by lower performancebased employee incentive expenses as compared to the prior year period sga as a percent of net sales for 2021 decreased by 60 basis points from the prior year level driven by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semifixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2021 period 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizational structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our management committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements 

during 2021 we recorded 511 million of special charges consisting principally of i 195 million associated with our exit of our rice product line in india as more fully described below ii 62 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in emea iii streamlining actions of 103 million in the americas region and 48 million in the emea region and iv a noncash asset impairment charge of 60 million associated with an administrative site that was sold in conjunction with our decision to employ a hybrid work environment as more fully described in note 3 of our notes of consolidated financial statements the 195 million special charge associated with the exit of our rice product line in india consisted of an 112 million noncash impairment charge associated with the impairment of certain intangible assets 36 million of employee severance and other related exit costs and a 47 million charge in cost of goods sold which represents a provision for the excess of the carrying value of rice inventories over the estimated net realizable value and a contractual obligation associated with terminating a rice supply agreement 

during 2020 we recorded 69 million of special charges consisting of 53 million related to streamlining actions in our emea region and 16 million related to our ge initiative 



during 2021 we recorded transaction and integration expenses of 353 million related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona these costs consisted of i 63 million of amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in cost of goods sold ii 138 million of other transaction expenses primarily related to outside advisory service and consulting costs and iii 152 million of integration expenses transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona of 112 million and 12 million respectively were incurred late in fiscal 2020 



operating income increased by 156 million or 16 from 9995 million in 2020 to 10151 million in 2021 special charges and transaction and integration expenses increased by 671 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 and negatively impacted operating income operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 170 basis points in 2021 to 161 in 2021 from 178 in 2020 as a result of the factors previously described excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described adjusted operating income was 11015 million in 2021 as compared to 10188 million in 2020 an increase of 827 million or 81 over the 2020 level adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 80 basis points in 2021 to 174 in 2021 from 182 in 2020 



interest expense was 10 million higher for 2021 as compared to the prior year as an increase in average total borrowings was largely offset by a decrease in interest rates other income net for 2021 decreased by 03 million as lower nonservice cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans was partially offset by higher interest income as compared to 2020 the decrease was also impacted by nonoperating foreign currency transaction gains in 2021 as compared to nonoperating foreign currency transaction losses in the prior period 



the provision for income taxes is based on the estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period we record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of us gaap examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income include but are not limited to excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations provisiontoreturn adjustments the settlement of tax audits changes in enacted tax rates changes in the assessment of deferred tax valuation allowances and the tax effects of certain intraentity asset transfers other than inventory 

the effective tax rate was 215 in 2021 as compared to 198 in 2020 the increase in our effective tax rate was principally attributable to the lower level of net discrete tax benefits in 2021 as compared to 2020 net discrete tax benefits were 266 million in 2021 a decrease of 168 million from 434 million in 2020 discrete tax benefits in both the 2021 and 2020 periods included excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 43 million and 142 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits 225 million and 49 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively due to in 2021 the partial release of certain reserves for an unrecognized tax benefit and related interest in a nonus jurisdiction based on a change in our assessment of the technical merits of that position associated with the availability of new information and in both years due to the expiration of the statues of limitations the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets 44 million and 119 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively and other discrete items in 2021 discrete tax items included 40 million of tax benefits related to the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from enacted legislation and 104 million of deferred state tax expense directly related to our december 2020 acquisition of fona in 2020 discrete tax items included 99 million of tax benefits associated with intraentity asset transfers that occurred see note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 114 million in 2021 from the prior year driven by an aftertax gain of 134 million on the sale of our 26 interest in eastern condiments private ltd eastern an unconsolidated operation during our second quarter of 2021 as more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including our largest joint venture 

mccormick de mexico that comprised 62 and 75 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2021 and 2020 respectively the relative impact of mccormick de mexico on income from unconsolidated operations in 2021 was impacted by the gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 280 in 2021 compared to 278 in 2020 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2020 to 2021 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from favorable currency exchange rates in 2021

sales for 2020 increased by 47 from 2019 and by 53 on a constant currency basis that 47 sales increase was driven by higher sales in our consumer segment which increased by 100 over the 2019 level partially offset by lower sales in our flavor solutions segment which declined by 35 from the prior year level on a consolidated basis higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 37 while pricing actions added 16 to sales that net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by higher demand within our consumer segment as measures imposed to mitigate the spread of covid19 and the related change in consumer behavior resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation that more than offset lower demand within our flavor solutions segment principally associated with our restaurant and branded food service customers sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency rates that decreased net sales 06 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 53 on a constant currency basis 



in 2020 our gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 411 from 401 in 2019 this improvement was driven by the favorable impact of cciled cost savings favorable pricing actions and the mix of consumer and flavor solutions sales partially offset by unfavorable conversion costs and increased material costs higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with covid19 including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity and the impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories 



sga expense was 12816 million in 2020 compared to 11668 million in 2019 an increase of 1148 million that increase in sga expense was primarily a result of i higher performancebased employee incentive expense accruals ii higher distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume iii increased brand marketing costs and iv a onetime fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that did not recur in 2020 all as compared to 2019 sga expense as a percent of net sales increased by 110 basis points from the prior year level primarily as a result of the previously mentioned factors partially offset by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semifixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2020 period 



during 2020 we recorded 69 million of special charges consisting of 53 million related to streamlining actions in our emea region and 16 million related to our ge initiative

interest expense was 296 million lower for 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in average total borrowings and a lower interest rate environment other income net for 2020 decreased by 91 million from the 2019 level due principally to lower nonservice cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans that declined by 76 million in 2020 from the prior year level 



the effective tax rate was 198 in 2020 as compared to 192 in 2019 the effective tax rate of 192 in 2019 includes a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 15 million associated with the us tax act net discrete tax benefits were 434 million in 2020 which is a decrease of 03 million from 437 million in 2019 including the 15 million 

nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act in 2019 discrete tax benefits in both the 2020 and 2019 periods include excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 142 million and 224 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the tax benefits associated with intraentity asset transfers that occurred 99 million and 152 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and other discrete items in 2020 discrete tax benefits included 119 million associated with the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets see note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate

we reported diluted earnings per share of 278 in 2020 compared to 262 in 2019 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2019 to 2020 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2020 



results of operations—segments 

consumer segment 

  

sales of our consumer segment in 2020 grew by 100 as compared to 2019 and grew by 103 on a constant currency basis this increase was driven by sharply higher sales of our consumer business in the americas and in emea with a partial offset from a sales decline in the asiapacific region asiapacific region sales declines were driven by lower sales in china which includes the impact of awayfromhome products included in its consumer portfolio higher volume and product mix added 88 to sales as measures imposed to mitigate the spread of covid19 resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation pricing actions added 15 to sales as compared to the prior year period the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased consumer segment sales by 03 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 103 on a constant currency basis

we grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by 1046 million or 155 in 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase in segment operating income was driven by the impact of higher sales as previously described and cciled cost savings partially offset by higher conversion costs increased material costs increased brand marketing costs and higher performancebased employee incentive expense accruals higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with covid19 including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees as well as measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity segment operating margin for our consumer segment rose by 100 basis points in 2020 to 217 driven by an increase in consumer gross profit margin that was partially offset by an increase in sga expense as a percentage of net sales as compared to the 2019 period segment operating margin in 2020 benefited from the leverage of fixed and semifixed expenses over a higher sales base than compared to the 2019 level on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our consumer segment rose by 157 in 2020 in comparison to the same period in 2019 

flavor solutions segment 

sales of our flavor solutions segment decreased 35 in 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased by 24 on a constant currency basis driving that decrease in sales was lower demand due to the impact of the covid19 disruption on our restaurant and branded food service customers particularly in the americas and emea regions unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales by 42 as compared to 2019 while pricing actions taken in response to increased costs during the period increased sales by 18 the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates decreased flavor solutions segment sales by 11 as compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 24 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas flavor solutions sales decreased by 35 in 2020 as compared to the prior year level and decreased by 25 on a constant currency basis unfavorable volume and product mix decreased flavor solutions sales in the americas by 44 during 2020 driven by lower sales to branded foodservice and quick service restaurant customers but was partially offset by higher sales to packaged food companies pricing actions increased sales by 19 as compared to the prior year period an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 10 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 25 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region flavor solutions sales in 2020 decreased by 55 from the prior year level and decreased by 42 on a constant currency basis unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales by 70 as compared to 2019 the decline was primarily attributable to lower sales to branded foodservice and quick service restaurant customers partially offset by higher demand from packaged food companies pricing actions increased sales by 28 in 2020 as compared the prior year level an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 13 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 42 on a constant currency basis

segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 643 million or 213 in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease in segment operating income was driven by lower sales increased conversion costs the impact of lower production volumes increased material costs and higher performancebased employee incentive expense accruals that were partially offset by cciled cost savings higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with covid19 including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees as well as measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity and the impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 260 basis points from the prior year level to 119 in 2020 driven by lower flavor solutions segment gross profit margin and an increase in sga expense as a percent of net sales segment operating margin in 2020 also declined due to the deleveraging impact of fixed and semifixed expenses over a lower sales base as compared to the 2019 period on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment declined by 197 in 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 

nongaap financial measures 

the following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit adjusted gross profit margin adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted income tax expense adjusted income tax rate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles these financial measures exclude the impact as applicable of the following 

• special charges – special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizationalstructural impact to require advance approval by our management committee upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a noncash component or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold impacted employees or operations expected timing and expected savings to the management committee and the committee’s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion 

• transaction and integration expenses associated with the cholula and fona acquisitions – we exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions of cholula and fona in november and december 2020 respectively and their subsequent integration into the company such costs which we refer to as “transaction and integration expenses” include transaction costs associated with each acquisition as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory together with the impact of discrete tax items if any directly related to each acquisition 

• income from sale of unconsolidated operations – we exclude the gain realized upon our sale of an unconsolidated operation in march 2021 as more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements the sale of our 26 interest in eastern resulted in a gain of 134 

million net of tax of 57 million the gain is included in income from unconsolidated operations in our consolidated income statement 

• income taxes associated with the us tax act – we recorded a net income tax benefit of 15 million during the year ended november 30 2019 associated with the us tax act enacted in december 2017 related provision to return adjustment 

details with respect to the composition of transaction and integration expenses special charges and income from the sale of unconsolidated operations recorded for the years and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2 3 and 5 respectively of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that these nongaap financial measures are important the exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

these nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting 

a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to gaap financial results is provided below 







because we are a multinational company we are subject to variability of our reported us dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis” is a nongaap measure we believe that this nongaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the us it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows 1 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2021 on a constant currency basis net sales and adjusted operating income for 2021 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2020 and compared to the reported results for 2020 and 2 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2020 on a constant currency basis net sales and operating income for 2020 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2019 and compared to the reported results for 2019 





to present the percentage change in projected 2022 net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share — diluted on a constant currency basis 2022 projected local currency net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted net income for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at currently prevailing exchange rates and are compared to those 2022 local currency projected results translated into us dollars at the average actual exchange rates in effect during the corresponding months in fiscal year 2021 to determine what the 2022 consolidated us dollar net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share — diluted would have been if the relevant currency exchange rates had not changed from those of the comparable 2021 periods 

liquidity and financial condition 

the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives we use a combination of equity and short and longterm debt we use shortterm debt comprised primarily of commercial paper principally to finance ongoing operations including our requirements for working capital accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories less accounts payable accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings 

our cash flows from operations enable us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives service our debt fund or increase our quarterly dividends fund capital projects and other investments and make share repurchases when appropriate due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business our cash flow from operations has historically been the strongest during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to the timing of the interest payments on our debt interest payments are higher in the first and third quarter of our fiscal year 

we believe that our sources of liquidity which include existing cash balances cash flows from operations existing credit facilities our commercial paper program and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt working capital needs planned capital expenditures and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows in addition in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effect of acquired operating assets and liabilities as the cash flows associated with acquisition of businesses is presented as an investing activity accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2021 the exchange rates for the canadian dollar and chinese renminbi were higher versus the us dollar than at november 30 2020 at november 30 2021 the exchange rates for the euro british pound sterling australian dollar and polish zloty were lower versus the us dollar than at november 30 2020 

operating cash flow – operating cash flow was 8283 million in 2021 10413 million in 2020 and 9468 million in 2019 net income as well as our working capital management as more fully described below impacted operating cash flow in 2021 the reduction in operating cash flow was the result of increased inventory levels to protect against supply disruption employee incentive payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions in 2020 the increases to operating cash flow were the result of a significantly lower use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities including the timing of certain employee incentive and customer related payments which was partially offset by the use of cash associated with working capital driven by the increased level of inventory to meet demand in 2019 our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow in 2019 those increases were partially offset by a use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities totaling 815 million 

our working capital management – principally related to inventory trade accounts receivable and accounts payable – impacts our operating cash flow the change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations it was a significant use of cash in 2021 and 2020 and a moderate use of cash in 2019 the change in trade accounts receivable was a use of cash in 2021 but a source of cash in 2020 and 2019 the change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in 2020 and 2019 and a more moderate source of cash in 2021 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 

the increase in ccc in 2021 from 2020 was due primarily to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of efforts to protect against supply chain disruption and to meet increased demand this was partially offset by an increase in our days payable outstanding the decrease in ccc in 2020 from 2019 was due to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers as more fully described below which was partially offset by an increase in our days in inventory due to maintaining higher levels of inventory 

prior to fiscal 2019 in response to evolving market practices we began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers we also initiated a supply chain finance program scf with several global financial institutions scf banks under the scf qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us to an scf bank these participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective scf bank while we are not party to those agreements the scf banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs this generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the scf and reaches an agreement with a scf bank the supplier elects which of our individual invoices they sell to the scf bank however all of our payments to participating suppliers are paid to the scf bank on the invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the scf bank 

the terms of our payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the scf our payment terms with our suppliers for similar materials within individual markets are consistent between those suppliers that elect to participate in the scf and those suppliers that do not participate accordingly our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the scf for our participating suppliers we believe substantially all of their receivables with us are sold to the scf banks accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to scf banks all outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the scf are recorded within the line entitled trade accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows as of november 30 2021 and 2020 the amount due to suppliers participating in the scf and included in trade accounts payable were approximately 2743 million and 2736 million respectively 

future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments such as changes in interest rates general market liquidity or our creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact those suppliers’ participation in the scf andor our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers however any such impacts are difficult to predict 

investing cash flow – net cash used in investing activities was 9086 million in 2021 10256 million in 2020 and 1710 million in 2019 our primary investing cash flows include the usage of cash associated with acquisition of businesses and capital expenditures cash usage related to our acquisition of businesses was 7064 million in 2021 and 8030 million in 2020 capital expenditures including expenditures for capitalized software were 2780 million in 2021 2253 million in 2020 and 1737 million in 2019 we expect 2022 capital expenditures to approximate 320 million to support our planned growth including the multiyear program to replace our erp system and other initiatives our primary investing cash inflow in 2021 was the 654 million of proceeds received from the sale of an unconsolidated operation as more fully discussed in note 5 of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

financing cash flow – net cash associated with financing activities was a source of cash of 220 million in 2021 and 2209 million in 2020 net cash used in financing activities was 7258 million in 2019 the variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings share repurchase activity and dividends all as described below 

the following table outlines our net borrowing activities 

in 2021 we borrowed 10015 million under longterm borrowing arrangements including net proceeds of 4957 million of 09 notes due february 2026 and net proceeds of 4928 million of 185 notes due february 2031 the net proceeds from these issuances were used to pay down shortterm borrowings including a portion of the 14430 million of commercial paper issued to fund our acquisitions of cholula and fona and for general corporate purposes we also repaid 2571 million of longterm debt including the 250 million 390 notes that matured in july 2021 

in 2020 we borrowed 5270 million under longterm borrowing arrangements including net proceeds of 4950 million of 25 notes due april 2030 we also repaid 2577 million of longterm debt including 2500 million associated with our term loans due in august 2022 

in 2019 we repaid 4477 million of longterm debt including 4363 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 

as of november 30 2021 576 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in november 2019 the timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors our share repurchase activity in 2021 2020 and 2019 has principally been executed in order to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 we received proceeds of 135 million 566 million and 909 million respectively from exercised stock options we repurchased 154 million 130 million and 127 million of common stock during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in conjunction with employee tax withholding requirements associated with our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 

in november 2021 the board of directors approved an 88 increase in the quarterly dividend from 034 to 037 per share 

most of our cash is in our subsidiaries outside of the us we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed prior to the enactment of the us tax act on december 22 2017 the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our nonus subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions as of november 30 2021 we have 13 billion of earnings from our nonus subsidiaries and joint ventures that are considered indefinitely reinvested while federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the us tax act we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes state income taxes or foreign exchange gains or losses it is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings 

at november 30 2021 we temporarily used 3348 million of cash from our nonus subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us during the year our shortterm borrowings vary but are lower at the end of a year or 

quarter the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2021 and 2020 were 10299 million and 5181 million respectively those average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the year ended november 30 2021 included average commercial paper borrowings of 9750 million the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2021 and 2020 was 55745 million and 43274 million respectively 

credit and capital markets – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in june 2021 we entered into a fiveyear 15 billion revolving credit facility which will expire in june 2026 the current pricing for the credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 125 the pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to libor plus 175 the provisions of this revolving credit facility restrict subsidiary indebtedness and require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio we do not expect that this covenant would limit our access to this revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future this facility replaced the following prior revolving credit facilities i a fiveyear 10 billion revolving credit facility that was due to expire in august 2022 and ii a 364day 10 billion revolving facility which we entered into in the first quarter of 2021 that was due to expire in december 2021 the terms of those revolving credit facilities are more fully described in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we generally use our revolving credit facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility this facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital we engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facility during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted facilities of 3084 million as of november 30 2021 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders discretion see note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements 

we will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest to service debt and to fund acquisitions as part of our ongoing operations we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments our primary obligations include principal and interest payments on our outstanding shortterm borrowings and longterm debt in the next year our most significant debt service obligation is the maturity of our 7500 million 270 notes due in august 2022 detail on these contractual obligations follows 

material cash requirements 

the following table reflects a summary of our future material cash requirements as of november 30 2021 



a interest payments include interest payments on shortterm borrowings and longterm debt see notes 6 and 7 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our other cash requirements at year end include raw material purchases lease payments income taxes and pension and postretirement benefits we acquire various raw materials to satisfy our obligations to our customers and these outstanding purchase obligations can fluctuate throughout the year based on our response to varying raw material cycles however these commitments generally do not extend past one year in addition we also have a series of commercial commitments largely consisting of standby letters of credit our standby letters of credit leases and pension and other post retirement obligations are more fully described in notes 6 7 and 11 respectively of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

these obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs to meet those cash requirements we intend to use our existing cash cash equivalents and internally generated funds to borrow under our existing credit facility or under other shortterm borrowing facilities and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular debt maturity or acquisition to our thenavailable sources of funds to obtain additional short and longterm financing we believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future cash requirements 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash contributions to pension plans including unfunded plans were 150 million in 2021 119 million in 2020 and 114 million in 2019 it is expected that the 2022 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 15 million future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent upon changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 55 of assets are invested in equities 34 in fixed income investments and 11 in other investments assets associated with our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 55 in equities and 45 in fixed income investments see note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements which provides details on our pension funding

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits 

in early fiscal 2021 we purchased fona the purchase price was approximately 708 million net of cash acquired fona is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food beverage and nutritional markets our acquisition of fona on december 30 2020 expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories as well as extends our technology platform and strengthens our capabilities the acquisition was funded with cash and shortterm borrowings the results of fonas operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our flavor solutions segment from the date of acquisition 

on november 30 2020 we purchased cholula for approximately 801 million net of cash acquired the acquisition was funded with cash and shortterm borrowings cholula a premium mexican hot sauce brand is a strong addition to mccormick’s global branded flavor portfolio which broadens the company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic mexican flavor hot sauce the results of cholula’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition 

we did not have any acquisitions in fiscal 2019 

see note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange risk – we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling chinese renminbi canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty singapore dollar mexican peso swiss franc and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling and australian dollar and finally the canadian dollar versus british pound sterling we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2021 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling euro polish zloty chinese reminbi australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso 

we also utilize cross currency interest rate swap contracts which are designated as net investment hedges to manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling and euro gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2021 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2021 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2021 

we had a number of smaller contracts at november 30 2021 with an aggregate notional value of 160 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the romanian leu and russian ruble the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 02 million at november 30 2021 

at november 30 2020 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty swiss franc and other currencies with a notional value of 3838 million the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 68 million at november 30 2020 

we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are considered net investment hedges as of november 30 2021 we had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of i 250 million notional value to receive 250 million at threemonth us libor plus 0685 and pay £1941 million at threemonth gbp libor plus 0740 and ii £1941 million notional value to receive £1941 million at threemonth gbp libor plus 0740 and pay €2218 million at threemonth euro euribor plus 0808 these crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts expire in august 2027 for more information refer to note 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk – our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we are exposed to interest rate volatility with primary exposures related to movements in us treasury rates london interbank offered rates libor and commercial paper rates libor will be subject to a transition or phase out that will commence on january 1 2022 with the phase out expected to be completed by june 30 2023 while libor is the current interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility synthetic lease interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of libor given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt 

we also use interest rate swaps to minimize financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2021 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

years of maturity at november 30 2021 

the table above displays the debt including finance leases by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects 

• we issued 250 million of 350 notes due in 2023 in august 2013 forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 330 

• we issued 250 million of 325 notes due in 2025 in november 2015 forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 345 the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 325 notes due in december 2025 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025 net interest payments are based on 3month libor plus 122 

• we issued 750 million of 340 notes due august 15 2027 and 300 million due in august 2027 in august 2017 forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these 750 million notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 344 the fixed interest rate on 250 million of the 340 notes due in 2027 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2027 net interest payments are based on 3month libor plus 0685 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2021 our most significant raw materials were dairy products pepper capsicums red peppers and paprika onion vanilla garlic and salt while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer arrangements known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments such as trade discounts rebates or returns are estimated at the time of sale where applicable future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding these programs key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a oneyear or shorter duration estimates that affect revenue such as trade incentives and product returns are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized certain 

of our customer arrangements are annual arrangements such that the degree of estimates that affects revenue reduces as a year progresses we do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of customer consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers 

business combinations goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses under the acquisition method our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets we generally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future considering the perspective of marketplace participants while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires judgment certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands while other acquired intangible assets eg customer relationships are expected to have determinable useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of definitelived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience the competitive and macroeconomic environment and our operating plans the costs of definitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions as more fully described in note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements while we believe those estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill impairment our reporting units are the same as our operating segments determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions as more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using a marketbased discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount as of november 30 2021 we had 53358 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 36747 million in the consumer segment and 16611 million in the flavor solutions segment our fiscal year 2021 impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill however variances between the actual performance of the businesses and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimates of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we estimate fair values through the use of the relieffromroyalty method and then compare those fair values to the related carrying amounts of the indefinitelived intangible asset in the event that the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks are less than their related carrying amounts a noncash impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 

the estimation of fair values of our brand names and trademarks requires us to make significant assumptions including expectations with respect to sales and profits of the respective brands and trademarks related royalty rates income tax rates and appropriate discount rates which are based in part upon current interest rates 

adjusted for our view of reasonable country and brand  specific risks based upon the past and anticipated future performance of the related brand names and trademarks  the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends macroeconomic conditions and projections consistent with our operating strategy changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses 

as of november 30 2021 we had 30674 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date of the 30674 million of brand names assets and trademarks as of november 30 2021 i 23200 million relates to the french’s frank’s redhot and cattlemen’s brand names and trademarks recognized as part of our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 that we group for purposes of our impairment analysis ii 3800 million relates to the cholula brand names and trademarks associated with the acquisition of cholula in november 2020 iii 490 million relates to the fona brand names and trademarks associated with the acquisition of fona in december 2020 and iv the remaining 3184 million represents a number of other brand name assets and trademarks with individual carrying values ranging from 02 million to 1064 million except for our recent acquisitions of cholula and fona the percentage excess of estimated fair value over respective book values for each of our brand names and trademarks including the 23200 million related to our french’s franks redhot and cattlemen’s brands was 20 or more as of november 30 2021 

the brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions including our recent acquisitions of cholula and fona may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values a change in assumptions with respect to recently acquired businesses including those affected by rising interest rates or a deterioration in expectations of future sales profitability or royalty rates as well as future economic and market conditions or higher income tax rates could result in noncash impairment losses in the future 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities can challenge certain of our tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits the tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest and penalties is adequate as of november 30 2021 the company had 310 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties recorded in other longterm liabilities the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates as more fully described in note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

pension benefits 

pension plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate changes in various assumptions and differences between the actual returns on plan assets and the expected returns on plan assets and changes to projected future rates of return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2022 pension benefit expense by approximately 1 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2022 pension expense by approximately 10 million 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the measurement of our pension benefit obligations in addition see note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis”

risks related to our company business and operations 

our operations may be adversely impacted as a result of pandemic outbreaks including covid19 

in december 2019 covid19 a strain of novel coronavirus was first reported in wuhan china resulting in thousands of confirmed cases of the disease in china by january 2020 the chinese government implemented a quarantine protocol for wuhan and implemented other restrictions for other major chinese cities including 

mandatory business closures social distancing measures and various travel restrictions in march 2020 as covid19 spread outside of china significantly impacting the rest of the world the world health organization designated the outbreak as a global pandemic the effects of covid19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread significantly impacted not only our operating results but also the global economy covid19 has impacted and continues to impact our customers our operations consumers and the global economy as discussed below however given the evolving health economic social and governmental environments the breadth and duration of such impact remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect our operations major facilities and the health of our employees and consumers the production of certain of our products in our americas emea and asiapacific geographic regions are concentrated in a single manufacturing site within each region to mitigate the spread of covid19 many governments have implemented quarantines and significant restrictions on travel as well as work restrictions that prohibited many employees from going to work as a result we temporarily closed certain manufacturing and other facilities for limited periods in 2020 our results have been and we expect will continue to be adversely impacted by these closures and other actions taken to contain or treat the impact of covid19 and the extent of such impact will depend upon future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted covid19 continues to interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in mid2020 we saw some loosening of governmentmandated covid19 restrictions in certain locales in response to improved covid19 infection levels however upon worsening covid19 infection levels in certain localities in late fiscal 2020 and in early fiscal 2021 local governmental authorities have either reimposed some or all of earlier restrictions or imposed other restrictions all in an effort to prevent the spread of covid19 

in early fiscal 2021 vaccines for combatting covid19 were approved by health agencies in certain countriesregions in which we operate including the us uk european union canada and mexico and began to be administered however initial quantities of vaccines are limited and vaccine distributions controlled by local authorities are being allocated generally first to frontline health care workers and other essential workers and next to those members of individual populations believed most susceptible to severe effects from covid19 full administration of the covid19 vaccines is unlikely to occur in most jurisdictions until mid to late 2021 the impact of covid19 including the impact of restrictions imposed to combat its spread could result in additional businesses being shut down additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable as a result it may be even more challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support our business needs and more individuals could become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions also governments may impose other laws regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations further as some of our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of our business financial condition or results of operations the potential effects of covid19 also could impact many of the other risk factors described herein but given the evolving health economic social and governmental environments such potential impact remains uncertain while we expect the impacts of covid19 to continue to have an effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products in the event that we are unable to supply our products to customers in the time frame and quantities that they desire whether due to increased demand or other factors our customers may discontinue all or a portion of their purchases from us and source competitive brands if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation 

we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to governmentimposed actions we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing such as the emergence of new sales channels like ecommerce and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business our flavor solutions segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our flavor solutions segment declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 23 of our consolidated sales in 2020 the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper vanilla capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice and wheat flour while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our cci program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we 

cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our results 

as of november 30 2020 we had approximately 50 billion of goodwill and approximately 30 billion of other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair 

value of those assets to their carrying values if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to their implied fair value or fair value respectively factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates the impairment of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 

because indefinitelived intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition of the related business indefinitelived intangible assets associated with recent business acquisitions particularly those acquired in recent low interest rate environments such as cholula and fona are more susceptible to impairment in periods of rising interest rates than indefinitelived intangible assets related to businesses acquired in periods of higher interest rates 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions and exit certain businesses or lines of business these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso swiss franc chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling and australian dollar and finally the canadian dollar versus british pound sterling we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the ongoing effects of the decision by british voters to exit the european union may negatively impact our operations 

on december 24 2020 the uk and the european union announced an agreement on the euuk trade and cooperation agreement the euuk trade deal that took effect on january 1 2021the trade deal was formally approved by the uk house of commons on december 30 2020 and is expected to be formally approved by the 

european union legislature in march 2021 while the euuk trade deal has removed uncertainty and a significant amount of financial risk associated with the uk’s exit from the european union we are still assessing its details and related impact on our uk business and other operations we believe that the new trading relationship between the uk and the european union will result in increased costs of goods imported into the uk from the european union and exported from the uk into the european union the movement of goods between the uk and the european union will continue to be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure also there will be additional costs related to goods that are deemed to originate outside of the uk or european union and for which the originating country has no trade agreement with the uk our ability to increase pricing of our products in light of increased costs is uncertain and to the extent we are unable to fully do so our profitability will decline 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials scientific consensus shows that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

risks relating to credit and capital markets our credit rating borrowings and dividends 

increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us 

on november 30 2020 we had total outstanding variable rate debt of approximately 950 million including 887 million of shortterm borrowings at a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 03 the interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on our credit ratings our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital 

our credit ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

we have incurred additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of cholula and fona that may limit our ability to among other matters issue additional indebtedness meet our debt service requirements react to rising interest rates comply with certain covenants and compete with less highly leveraged competitors 

after financing our acquisition of cholula on november 30 2020 we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as of november 30 2020 the indebtedness of mccormick and its subsidiaries is approximately 49 billion subsequent to november 30 2020 we acquired fona for 710 million which we funded with cash and commercial paper borrowings  this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 

• increasing our debt service obligations making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds including an anticipated longterm debt financing in fiscal 2021 of the cholula and fona acquisition indebtedness together with our 39 notes in the amount of 250 million that mature in july 2021 and increasing the cost of any such borrowing 

• increasing our exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates 

• subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants the noncompliance with which could result in an event of default 

• increasing our vulnerability to and reducing our flexibility to respond to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes including funding of acquisitions if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the uncertainty regarding the potential phaseout of libor may negatively impact our operating results 

libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out after calendar year 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate without this data libor may no longer be published or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to libor although the us federal reserve in connection with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the referenced rate and how this will impact the company’s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments the company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the alternative reference rates committee the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results 

the declaration payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors

risks related to intellectual property information technology and cybersecurity 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business we rely on our information technology systems some of which are or may be managed or hosted by or outsourced to third party service providers to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems and infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades or oversee third party service providers our business or financial results could be negatively impacted the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction or reporting errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems are subject to cyberattacks or other security incidents service disruptions or other system or process failures such incidents could result in unauthorized access to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data as well as disruptions to operations we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents although to date none has been material to address the risks to our information technology systems and data we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology developing security policies and procedures implementing and assessing the effectiveness of controls conducting risk assessments of third party service providers and designing business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident it may have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and we may experience other adverse consequences such as loss of assets remediation costs litigation regulatory investigations and the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes and functions which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

if we are not able to successfully implement our business transformation initiative or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted 

we continue to implement our multiyear business transformation initiative to execute significant change to our global processes capabilities and operating model including in our global enablement ge organization in order to provide a scalable platform for future growth while reducing costs as technology provides the backbone for greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we are also making investments in our information systems including the multiyear program to replace our enterprise resource planning erp system currently underway which includes the transformation of our financial processing systems to enterprisewide systems solutions these systems implementations are part of our ongoing business transformation initiative and we plan to implement these systems throughout all parts of our businesses if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of our business which could result in the loss of customers and revenue in addition failure to either deliver the applications on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue in connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls including our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting 

we utilize cloudbased services and systems and networks managed by thirdparty vendors to process transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees customers vendors and other third parties our utilization of these cloudbased services and systems will increase as we implement our business transformation initiatives if any of these thirdparty service providers or vendors do not perform effectively or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance including compliance with servicelevel agreements or regulatory or legal requirements we may not be able to achieve expected cost savings we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation which could have a negative impact on employee morale in addition the management of multiple thirdparty service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control 

risks related to our global business litigation laws and regulations 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacturing storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment consumer protection competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification customs and trade laws including the import and export of products and product ingredients employment and health and safety enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

in addition there are various compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals including such obligations required by the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr which came into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act ccpa which came into effect in january 

2020 these types of data privacy laws create a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals and increases financial penalties for noncompliance for example the ccpa imposes requirements on companies that do business in california and collect personal information from customers including notice consent and service provider requirements the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements as well as a private right of action for data breaches regulations to implement portions of the ccpa have not been finalized and could significantly impact ccpa compliance measures as a company that is subject to data privacy laws we bear the costs of compliance with them including the gdpr and ccpa and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of these laws which continue to evolve these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

our international and crossborder operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2020 approximately 38 of our sales were generated in countries other than the us our international operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties several countries within the european union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union and the uk additionally sales in countries other than the us together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the us are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

the global nature of our business changes in tax legislation and the resolution of tax uncertainties create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of international subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and flavor solutions as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 and increase adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 

impact of global covid19 pandemic –during the year ended november 30 2020 the effects of a new coronavirus covid19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread significantly impacted not only our operating results but also the global economy 

the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on our consolidated operating results in early fiscal 2020 was limited in all material respects to our operations in china where the chinese government mandated numerous measures including closures of businesses limitations on movements of individuals and goods and the imposition of other restrictive measures in its efforts to mitigate the spread of covid19 within the country in march 2020 as covid19 spread outside of china significantly impacting the rest of the world the world health organization designated the outbreak as a global pandemic the pandemic spread outside of china in the balance of fiscal year 2020 to impact operations in our americas and europe middle east and africa emea regions in addition to elsewhere in our asiapacific region the effects of covid19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread significantly impacted not only our operating results but also the global economy 

in the us many state and local governments based on local conditions either recommended or mandated actions to slow the transmission of covid19 these measures ranged from limitations on crowd size together with closures of bars and dinein restaurants to mandatory orders for nonessential citizens to shelter in place governments in nonus jurisdictions also implemented shelterinplace orders quarantines significant restrictions on travel as well as restrictions that prohibited many employees from going to work borders between countries have been closed to contain the spread of covid19 contagion the extent and nature of government actions varied during fiscal year 2020 and in early fiscal year 2021 based upon the thencurrent extent and severity of the covid19 pandemic within their respective countries and localities 

we identified three priorities while navigating through the period of volatility and uncertainty associated with various stages of the covid19 pandemic 

▪ first to ensure the health and safety of our employees and the quality and integrity of our products 

▪ second to keep our brands and our customers brands in supply and to maintain the financial strength of our business 

▪ third to ensure mccormick emerges strong from this event the pandemic will come to an end and we believe that we will come out a better company by driving our longterm strategies responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on opportunities from our relative strength 

we implemented numerous measures over the course of fiscal 2020 to ensure that these priorities were achieved including i for our manufacturing and distribution employees who played a critical role in maintaining the supply of our products to our customers and consumers we instituted preshift temperature checks temporarily increased pay and benefits and provided time to enable social distancing and even greater sanitation procedures during shift changes ii for our other employees we instituted workfromhome arrangements iii we maintained close communication with customers and suppliers to enable us to react to changing demand and iv throughout the organization we empowered global regional and local crisis response teams that enabled us to react quickly to the challenging environment 

our sales increased by 47 for the year ended november 30 2020 over the 2019 level that increase was driven by an 100 increase in sales of our consumer segment partially offset by a 35 decline in sales of our flavor solutions segment our operating results have and will continue to be impacted by covid19 including the related recovery and the shift in consumer demand resulting from the pandemic we have partnered with our customers to monitor consumer demand changes and address the shift to athome versus awayfromhome consumption we estimate that awayfromhome consumption has historically represented approximately 20 of our consolidated sales the effects of covid19 on consumer behavior have on a net basis favorably impacted the operating results of our consumer segment and unfavorably impacted the operating results of our flavor solutions segment during the year ended november 30 2020 the impact of covid19 on our consumer segment during fiscal 2020 resulted in a significant increase in athome consumption and related demand for our products the unfavorable impact on our flavor solutions segment during the same periods was principally attributable to decreased demand from certain customers that were affected by government mandates related to covid19 in many of our markets those measures required closures of or capacity limitations on dinein restaurants or restricted operations of those restaurants to carryout or delivery only and also restricted operations of quick service restaurants to drivethrough pickup or delivery the resulting negative demand impacts in our flavor solutions segment were partially offset by increased athome consumption from certain customers in our flavor solutions segment that use our products to flavor their own brands for athome consumption the impact of covid19 on our consumer segment and flavor solutions segment moderated during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 during that quarter our sales increased by 49 over the comparable period in 2019 driven by a 59 increase in sales of our consumer segment and a 31 increase in sales of our flavor solutions segment the 59 fourth quarter growth in sales of our consumer segment was moderated by the lack of availability of certain of our consumer products in the us following the sustained increase in demand earlier in 2020 that caused us to suspend or curtail production of some secondary products in the fourth quarter to protect the supply of our top selling holiday items 

upon worsening covid19 infection levels in certain localities in late fiscal 2020 and in early fiscal 2021 local governmental authorities have either reimposed some or all of earlier restrictions or imposed other restrictions all in an effort to check the spread of covid19 

in early fiscal 2021 vaccines effective in combatting covid19 were approved by health agencies in certain countriesregions in which we operate including the us uk european union canada and mexico and began to be administered however initial quantities of vaccines are limited and vaccine distributions controlled by local authorities are being allocated generally first to frontline health care workers and other essential workers and next to those members of individual populations believed most susceptible to severe effects from covid19 full administration of the covid19 vaccines is unlikely to occur in most jurisdictions until mid to late2021 the pace and shape of the covid19 recovery described above as well as the impact and extent of potential resurgences is not presently known these and other uncertainties with respect to covid19 could result in changes to our current expectations in addition to a number of adverse impacts to our business including but not limited to additional disruption to the economy and consumers’ willingness and ability to spend temporary or permanent closures by businesses that consume our products such as restaurants additional work restrictions and supply chains being interrupted slowed or rendered inoperable or in the case of significant increased demand for our product incapable of fulfilling that increased demand as a result it may be challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support our business needs and individuals could become ill quarantined or otherwise unable to work andor travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions also governments may impose other laws regulations or taxes which could adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations further if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected they might delay or reduce purchases from us the potential effects of covid19 also could impact us in a number of other ways including but not limited to variations in the level of our 

profitability laws and regulations affecting our business fluctuations in foreign currency markets the availability of future borrowings the cost of borrowings valuation of our pension assets and obligations credit risks of our customers and counterparties and potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets 

sales growth  over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business – driven by brand marketing support category management and differentiated customer engagement 2 new products and 3 acquisitions 

base business – we expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed quality and effectiveness we measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support through digital marketing we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes provide cooking advice and discover new products 

new products – for our consumer segment we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition including private label we are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion from gourmet premium items to convenient and valuepriced flavors 

for flavor solutions customers we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products as well as flavors for new menu items we have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans many of which include “betterforyou” innovation with over 20 product innovation centers around the world we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers 

acquisitions – acquisitions are expected to approximate onethird of our sales growth over time since the beginning of 2015 we have completed nine acquisitions which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments we focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health geographically our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets our acquisitions have included bolton opportunities as well as the following recent acquisitions 

• on december 30 2020 we acquired fona international llc and certain of its affiliates fona a privately owned company for approximately 710 million net of cash acquired subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments we financed this fiscal 2021 acquisition with cash and shortterm borrowings fona is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food beverage and nutritional markets which expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories as well as extends our technology platform strengthens our capabilities and accelerates the strategic migration of our portfolio to more valueadded and technically insulated products 

• on november 30 2020 we acquired the parent company of cholula hot sauce® cholula from l catterton for approximately 803 million net of cash acquired subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments cholula is a strong addition to mccormick’s global branded flavor portfolio which broadens the company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic mexican flavor hot sauce in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments 

• on august 17 2017 we acquired reckitt benckisers food division rb foods for approximately 42 billion the acquired marketleading brands of rb foods included french’s® frank’s redhot® and cattlemen’s® which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio we believe that these additions moved us to a leading position in the attractive us condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments 

the fona and cholula acquisitions are expected to contribute more than onethird of our sales growth in 2021 the rb foods acquisition contributed more than onethird of our sales growth in 2018 and 2017 

cost savings and business transformation  we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

we are making investments to build the mccormick of the future including in our global enablement ge organization to transform mccormick through globally aligned innovative services to enable growth as more fully described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements we expect to incur special charges of approximately 60 million to 65 million associated with our ge initiative of which approximately 399 million have been recognized through november 30 2020 as technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we are also making investments in our information systems from late 2018 through early 2020 we progressed in implementing our global enterprise resource planning erp replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we elected to pause activity related to our erp for the balance of fiscal 2020 due in part to covid19 restrictions that restricted necessary travel by internal and external erp team members and made it difficult for local mccormick personnel to actively participate in the erp development data cleansing and testing prior to then scheduled pilots later in fiscal 2020 in addition the pause of this activity enabled all mccormick employees to focus their activities on the three priorities previously described under the heading “impact of covid19 pandemic” for navigating through the period of volatility and uncertainty associated with various stages of the covid19 pandemic 

we expect that in total over the course of the erp replacement program from late 2018 through 2023 we will invest from approximately 350 million to 400 million including expenses related to the golive activities in our operations to enable the anticipated completion of the global roll out of our new information technology platform in 2022 of that projected 350 million to 400 million we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 50 and program expenses to account for approximately 50 of the approximately 175 million to 200 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending related to our erp replacement program approximately 40 million have been recognized through november 30 2020 of the approximately 175 million to 200 million of capitalized software included in our projected total spending related to our erp program approximately 87 million has been recognized through november 30 2020 

the ge initiative is expected to generate annual savings ranging from approximately 45 million to 55 million once all actions are implemented including those that are dependent on the replacement of our global erp platform 

cash flow  we continue to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 10413 million in 2020 an increase of 945 million from the 9468 million realized in 2019 in 2020 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 35 years and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2020 the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was 3774 million 

operating results  on a longterm basis we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2020 we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 47 over the 2019 level due to the following factors 

• we grew volume and product mix which added 37 of sales growth this growth was driven by sharply higher demand within our consumer segment as the continuation of measures imposed to mitigate the spread of covid19 and the related change in consumer behavior resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation that more than offset lower demand within our flavor solutions segment principally associated with our branded food service customers 

• pricing actions contributed 16 of the increase in net sales 

• net sales growth was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that decreased sales growth by 06 excluding this impact we grew sales by 53 over the prior year on a constant currency basis 

operating income was 9995 million in 2020 and 9577 million in 2019 we recorded 69 million and 208 million of special charges in 2020 and 2019 respectively related to organization and streamlining actions in 2020 we also recorded 124 million of transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona that reduced operating income in 2020 compared to the yearago period the favorable impact of higher sales and 1130 million of cost savings from our cci program including organization and streamlining actions more than offset the impact of increased conversion costs covid19 related expenses higher incentive compensation and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates during 2020 covid19 related 

expenses included certain actions taken in response to the pandemic including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity and impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories excluding special charges together with for 2020 transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona adjusted operating income was 10188 million in 2020 an increase of 41 compared to 9785 million in the yearago period in constant currency adjusted operating income rose 48 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see the subsequent discussion under the heading nongaap financial measures 

diluted earnings per share was 278 in 2020 and 262 in 2019 the yearonyear increase in earnings per share was driven mainly by higher operating income and decreased interest expense those favorable impacts in 2020 were partially offset by the impact of a higher effective tax rate a decrease in other income and the impact of higher shares outstanding special charges and in 2020 transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by 005 and 006 in 2020 and 2019 respectively excluding the effects of special charges transaction and integration expenses and the nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act adjusted diluted earnings per share was 283 in 2020 and 268 in 2019 or an increase of 56 

2021 outlook 

in 2021 we expect to grow net sales over the 2020 level by 7 to 9 including an estimated 2 favorable impact from currency rates or 5 to 7 on a constant currency basis that anticipated 2021 sales growth includes the incremental impact of the cholula and fona acquisitions which we expect to comprise 35 to 40 of the expected 7 to 9 sales growth and higher volume and product mix driven by our category management brand marketing new product and differentiated customer engagement growth plans we expect to have organic sales growth in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments 

we expect our 2021 gross profit margin to range from a decline of 10 basis points to an increase of 15 basis points from our gross profit margin of 411 in 2020 the projected 2021 range of change in gross profit margin is principally due to i expected accretion from our acquisitions of cholula and fona net of transaction and integration expenses of 69 million related to the amortization of the stepup of the acquired inventories of cholula and fona to fair value ii anticipated unfavorable sales mix in 2021 between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2020 iii an expected increase in covid19 expenses of approximately 10 million in 2021 over the 2020 level and iv an anticipated lowsingledigit level of inflation in 2021 compared to 2020 excluding the 69 million of transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona included in our projected range of gross profit margin anticipated in 2021 we expect our adjusted gross profit margin to range from comparable to 25 basis points higher than our 2020 gross profit margin of 411 

in 2021 we expect an increase in operating income of 4 to 6 which includes an estimated 2 favorable impact from currency rates over the 2020 level the projected range of change in operating income in 2021 reflects an expected increase of approximately 30 million in expense related to our global erp replacement program over the fiscal 2020 level our cciled cost savings target in 2021 is approximately 110 million and approximates the 113 million of cciled cost savings realized in 2020 we anticipate transaction and integration expenses related to the cholula and fona acquisitions of approximately 50 million to negatively impact operating income in 2021 as compared to 124 million of transaction and integration expenses in 2020 we also expect approximately 8 million of special charges in 2021 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions in 2020 special charges were 69 million excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses we expect 2021’s adjusted operating income to increase by 8 to 10 which includes an estimated 2 favorable impact from currency rates or to increase by 6 to 8 on a constant currency basis over the 2020 level 

our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2021 than in 2020 we estimate our effective tax rate including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items to approximate 24 in 2021 as compared to 198 in 2020 excluding projected taxes associated with special charges and transaction and integration expenses including the unfavorable impact in 2021 of a discrete tax item related to our acquisition of fona we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will approximate 23 in fiscal 2021 as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 199 in 2020 

diluted earnings per share was 278 in 2020 diluted earnings per share for 2021 is projected to range from 271 to 276 excluding the per share impact of special charges and transaction and integration expenses of 001 and 004 respectively adjusted diluted earnings per share was 283 in 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share 

excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of 002 and from transaction and integration expenses of 018 including the unfavorable impact of a discrete tax item of 004 related to our acquisition of fona is projected to range from 291 to 296 in 2021 we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow by 3 to 5 which includes a 2 favorable impact from currency rates or to grow by 1 to 3 on a constant currency basis over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 283 in 2020 

results of operations—2020 compared to 2019 



sales for 2020 increased by 47 from 2019 and by 53 on a constant currency basis that 47 sales increase was driven by higher sales in our consumer segment which increased by 100 over the 2019 level partially offset by lower sales in our flavor solutions segment which declined by 35 from the prior year level on a consolidated basis higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 37 while pricing actions added 16 to sales that net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by higher demand within our consumer segment as measures imposed to mitigate the spread of covid19 and the related change in consumer behavior resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation that more than offset lower demand within our flavor solutions segment principally associated with our restaurant and branded food service customers sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency rates that decreased net sales 06 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 53 on a constant currency basis 



in 2020 our gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 411 from 401 in 2019 this improvement was driven by the favorable impact of cciled cost savings favorable pricing actions and the mix of consumer and flavor solutions sales partially offset by unfavorable conversion costs and increased material costs higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with covid19 including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity and the impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories 



selling general and administrative sga expense was 12816 million in 2020 compared to 11668 million in 2019 an increase of 1148 million that increase in sga expense was primarily a result of i higher performancebased employee incentive expense accruals ii higher distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume iii increased brand marketing costs and iv a onetime fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that did not recur in 2020 all as compared to 2019 sga expense as a percent of net sales increased by 110 basis points from the prior year level primarily as a result of the previously mentioned factors partially offset by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semifixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2020 period 



we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizational structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our management committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements 

during 2020 we recorded 69 million of special charges consisting of 53 million related to streamlining actions in our emea region and 16 million related to our ge initiative 

during 2019 we recorded 208 million of special charges consisting primarily of i 141 million of costs related to our multiyear ge business transformation initiative including 106 million of thirdparty expenses 21 million related to severance and related benefits and 14 million related to other costs ii 23 million of severance and related benefits associated with streamlining actions in the americas and iii 39 million related to streamlining actions in our emea region 



transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of cholula and fona of 112 million and 12 million respectively were incurred late in fiscal 2020 we expect to incur additional transaction and integration expenses related to these acquisitions in fiscal 2021 



operating income increased by 418 million or 44 from 9577 million in 2019 to 9995 million in 2020 operating income as a percent of net sales declined by 10 basis points in 2020 to 178 in 2020 from 179 in 2019 as a result of the factors previously described excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described adjusted operating income was 10188 million in 2020 as compared to 9785 million in 2019 an increase of 403 million or 41 over the 2019 level adjusted operating income as a percent of net sales declined by 10 basis points in 2020 to 182 in 2020 from 183 in 2019 



interest expense was 296 million lower for 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in average total borrowings and a lower interest rate environment other income net for 2020 decreased by 91 million from the 2019 level due principally to lower nonservice cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans that declined by 76 million in 2020 from the prior year level 



the provision for income taxes is based on the current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period we record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of us gaap examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income of the current fiscal year include but are not limited to excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations provisiontoreturn adjustments the settlement of tax audits changes in enacted tax rates changes in the assessment of deferred tax valuation allowances and the tax effects of intraentity asset transfers other than inventory 

the effective tax rate was 198 in 2020 as compared to 192 in 2019 the effective tax rate of 192 in 2019 includes a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 15 million associated with the us tax act as more fully described in note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements net discrete tax benefits were 434 million in 2020 which is a decrease of 03 million from 437 million in 2019 including the 15 million nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act in 2019 discrete tax benefits in both the 2020 and 2019 periods include excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 142 million and 224 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the tax benefits associated with intraentity asset transfers that occurred 99 million and 152 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and other discrete items in 2020 discrete tax benefits included 119 million associated with the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets see note 13 of notes to 

our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 01 million in 2020 from the prior year we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico that comprised 75 and 72 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 278 in 2020 compared to 262 in 2019 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2019 to 2020 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2020 



results of operations—segments 

we measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions see note 16 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment of operating income excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions in the following discussion we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as segment operating income 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment in 2020 grew by 100 as compared to 2019 and grew by 103 on a constant currency basis this increase was driven by sharply higher sales of our consumer business in the americas and in emea with a partial offset from a sales decline in the asiapacific region asiapacific region sales declines were driven by lower sales in china which includes the impact of awayfromhome products included in its consumer portfolio higher volume and product mix added 88 to sales as measures imposed to mitigate the spread of covid19 resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward athome meal preparation pricing actions added 15 to sales as compared to the prior year period the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased consumer segment sales by 03 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 103 on a constant currency basis

in the asiapacific region consumer sales decreased 166 as compared to 2019 and decreased 151 on a constant currency basis lower volume and product mix reduced sales by 150 the decrease was driven by products related to awayfromhome consumption in china partially offsetting this decline was growth in cookingathome products particularly in australia pricing actions reduced sales by 01 as compared to 2019 the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 15 compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 151 on a constant currency basis 

we grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by 1046 million or 155 in 2020 as compared to 2019 the increase in segment operating income was driven by the impact of higher sales as previously described and cciled cost savings partially offset by higher conversion costs increased material costs increased brand marketing costs and higher performancebased employee incentive expense accruals higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with covid19 including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees as well as measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity segment operating margin for our consumer segment rose by 100 basis points in 2020 to 217 driven by an increase in consumer gross profit margin that was partially offset by an increase in sga expense as a percentage of net sales as compared to the 2019 period segment operating margin in 2020 benefited from the leverage of fixed and semifixed expenses over a higher sales base than compared to the 2019 level on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our consumer segment rose by 157 in 2020 in comparison to the same period in 2019 

flavor solutions segment 

  



sales of our flavor solutions segment decreased 35 in 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased by 24 on a constant currency basis driving that decrease in sales was lower demand due to the impact of the covid19 disruption on our restaurant and branded food service customers particularly in the americas and emea regions unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales by 42 as compared to 2019 while pricing actions taken in response to increased costs during the period increased sales by 18 the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates decreased flavor solutions segment sales by 11 as compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 24 on a constant currency basis

segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 643 million or 213 in 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease in segment operating income was driven by lower sales increased conversion costs the impact of lower production volumes increased material costs and higher performancebased employee incentive expense accruals that were partially offset by cciled cost savings higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with covid19 including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees as well as measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity and the impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 260 basis points from the prior year level to 119 in 2020 driven by lower flavor solutions segment gross profit margin and an increase in sga expense as a percent of net sales segment operating margin in 2020 also declined due to the deleveraging impact of fixed and semifixed expenses over a lower sales base as compared to the 2019 period on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment declined by 197 in 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 

results of operations—2019 compared to 2018 



sales for 2019 increased by 08 from 2018 and by 27 on a constant currency basis both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 25 to sales this was driven by product innovation as well as growth in the base business pricing actions added 02 to sales these factors were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 19 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 27 on a constant currency basis 



in 2019 our gross profit margin increased 60 basis points to 401 from 395 in 2018 driven by the favorable impact of cciled cost savings partially offset by unfavorable conversion costs 



sga expense was 11668 million in 2019 compared to 11634 million in 2018 an increase of 34 million that increase in sga expense was driven by increased stockbased compensation expense and higher distribution costs partially offset by cciled cost savings sga expense in 2019 also reflected the impact of two significant 

but largely offsetting items i expenses associated with our investment in a global erp platform in support of our ge business transformation initiative that increased sga expense over the prior year level and ii a onetime fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that decreased sga expense from the prior year level as a result of the above factors over an increased net sales base sga expense as a percent of net sales was 218 a 20basis point improvement from 2018 



during 2019 we recorded 208 million of special charges consisting primarily of i 141 million of costs related to our multiyear ge business transformation initiative including 106 million of thirdparty expenses 21 million related to severance and related benefits and 14 million related to other costs ii 23 million of severance and related benefits associated with streamlining actions in the americas and iii 39 million related to streamlining actions in our emea region

transaction and integration expenses related to the rb foods acquisition totaled 225 million for 2018 these costs primarily consisted of outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition 



operating income increased by 666 million or 75 from 8911 million in 2018 to 9577 million in 2019 an absence of transaction and integration expenses in 2019 compared to 225 million related to our acquisition of rb foods in 2018 more than offset a 45 million increase in special charges in 2019 from 163 million in 2018 to 208 million in 2019 operating income as a percent of net sales rose by 110 basis points in 2019 from 168 in 2018 to 179 in 2019 as a result of the factors previously described our operating income as a percent of net sales in 2019 was impacted by two large but substantially offsetting items i expenses associated with our investment in a global erp platform in support of our ge business transformation initiative that decreased operating income as a percent of sales by approximately 35 basis points in 2019 and ii a onetime fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that increased operating income as a percent of sales by approximately 40 basis points in 2019 excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described adjusted operating income was 9785 million in 2019 as compared to 9299 million in 2018 an increase of 486 million or 52 over the 2018 level adjusted operating income as a percent of sales rose by 80 basis points in 2019 from 175 in 2018 to 183 in 2019 



interest expense was 94 million lower for 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in average total borrowings other income net for 2019 increased by 19 million from the 2018 level due principally to higher nonservice cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans and higher interest income which was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a building which was reflected in our 2018 results and did not recur in 2019 



as more fully described above and in note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements the us tax act was enacted in december 2017 the us tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries under gaap specifically asc topic 740 income taxes the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted we recorded a net benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act during 2018 this amount includes a 3800 million benefit from the revaluation of our net us deferred tax liabilities as of january 1 2018 based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset in part by an estimated net transition tax impact of 785 million that net transition tax impact is comprised of the mandated onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries estimated at 753 million together with additional foreign withholding taxes of 79 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the us tax act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018 less a 47 million reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes directly resulting from the transition tax in addition in 2019 we recorded a benefit of 15 million relating to an adjustment to a prior year tax accrual associated with the us tax act 

the effective tax rate was an expense of 192 in 2019 as compared to a benefit of 212 in 2018 the effective tax rate benefit of 212 in 2018 includes the nonrecurring net tax benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act as more fully described above that had a 407 impact on 2018’s effective tax rate net discrete tax benefits were 437 million in 2019 which is an increase of 156 million from 281 million in 2018 excluding the nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act in 2018 for 2019 the effective tax rate was impacted by 152 million of tax benefits associated with an intraentity asset transfer that occurred during 2019 under the provisions of asu no 201616 which we adopted on december 1 2018 discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 224 million and 217 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions the previously described nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act and other discrete items see note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations increased 61 million in 2019 from the prior year this increase was primarily attributable to the impact of higher earnings from our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico as well as the impact of eliminating a lower level of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2019 as compared to 2018 we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including mccormick de mexico that comprised 72 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2019 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 262 in 2019 compared to 350 in 2018 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2018 to 2019 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2019

• special charges – special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizationalstructural impact to require advance approval by our management committee upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a noncash component or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold impacted employees or operations expected timing and expected savings to the management committee and the committee’s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion in 2018 we also included in special charges as approved by our management committee expense associated with a onetime payment made to eligible us hourly employees to distribute a portion of the nonrecurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the us tax act as that nonrecurring income tax benefit is excluded from our computation of adjusted income taxes adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share each a nongaap measure 

• transaction and integration expenses associated with the cholula fona and rb foods acquisitions – we exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions of cholula and fona in november and december 2020 respectively and rb foods in august 2017 and their subsequent integration into the company such costs which we refer to as “transaction and integration expenses” include transaction costs associated with each acquisition as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory together with the impact of discrete tax items if any directly related to each acquisition 

• income taxes associated with the us tax act – in connection with the enactment of the us tax act in december 2017 we recorded a net nonrecurring income tax benefit of 3015 million during the year ended november 30 2018 which included the estimated impact of the tax benefit from revaluation of net us deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and the tax expense associated with the onetime transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of nonus subsidiaries we recorded an additional net income tax benefit of 15 million during the year ended november 30 2019 associated with a us tax act related provision to return adjustment 

details with respect to the composition of transaction and integration expenses special charges and nonrecurring income tax benefits associated with the us tax act recorded for the years and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2 3 and 13 respectively of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that these nongaap financial measures are important the exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

these nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting 

a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 









because we are a multinational company we are subject to variability of our reported us dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis” is a nongaap measure we believe that this nongaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the us it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows 1 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2020 on a constant currency basis net sales and adjusted operating income for 2020 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2019 and compared to the reported results for 2019 and 2 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2019 on a constant currency basis net sales and operating income for 2019 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2018 and compared to the reported results for 2018 





to present the percentage change in projected 2021 net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share — diluted on a constant currency basis 2021 projected local currency net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted net income for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at currently prevailing exchange rates and are compared to those 2021 local currency projected results translated into us dollars at the average actual exchange rates in effect during the corresponding months in fiscal year 2020 to determine what the 2021 consolidated us dollar net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share — diluted would have been if the relevant currency exchange rates had not changed from those of the comparable 2020 periods 



in addition to the above nongaap financial measures we use a leverage ratio which is determined using nongaap measures a leverage ratio is a widelyused measure of ability to repay outstanding debt obligations and is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating financial leverage we believe that our leverage ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage although our method to calculate our leverage ratio may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate such a leverage ratio we determine our leverage ratio as net debt which we define as total debt net of cash in excess of 750 million to adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses for interest income taxes depreciation and amortization less interest income and as further adjusted for cash and noncash acquisitionrelated expenses which may include the effect of the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory on cost of goods sold special charges stockbased compensation expenses and certain gains or losses which may include third party fees and expenses and integration costs adjusted ebitda and our leverage ratio are both nongaap financial measures our determination of the leverage ratio is consistent with the terms of our revolving credit facilities which require us to maintain our leverage ratio below certain levels under those agreements the applicable leverage ratio is reduced periodically as of november 30 2020 our capacity under the revolving credit facilities was not affected by these covenants in early fiscal 2021 following our acquisition of fona the levels specified in our revolving credit facilities under which we are required to maintain our leverage ratios were amended by the participating banks to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratios we do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facilities for the foreseeable future however the leverage ratio could restrict our ability to utilize these facilities we expect to comply with this financial covenant for the foreseeable future 

the following table reconciles our net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended november 30 





our longterm target for our leverage ratio is 15 to 20 our leverage ratio can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity 

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives service our debt increase our dividend fund capital projects and other investments and make share repurchases when appropriate due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business our cash flow from operations has historically been the strongest during the fourth quarter 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows in addition in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effect of acquired operating assets and liabilities as the cash flows associated with acquisition of businesses is presented as an investing activity accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2020 the exchange rates for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar chinese renminbi and polish zloty were higher versus the us dollar than at november 30 2019 during 2020 we have seen greaterthannormal fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates as a result of increased market volatility driven by the global covid19 pandemic 

operating cash flow – operating cash flow was 10413 million in 2020 9468 million in 2019 and 8212 million in 2018 the increases in cash flow from operations in both 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to higher net income exclusive of the 2018 impact of the noncash nonrecurring net income tax benefit of 3094 million related to the us tax act in addition as more fully described below our working capital management impacted operating cash flow in 2020 the increases to operating cash flow were the result of a significantly lower use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities including the timing of certain employee incentive and customer related payments which was partially offset by the use of cash associated with working capital driven by the increased level of inventory to meet demand in 2019 and 2018 our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow in 2019 those increases were partially offset by a use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities totaling 815 million in 2018 those increases were partially offset by a higher use of cash from other operating assets and liabilities partially related to the timing of our payment of transaction and integration expenses as well as of interest on indebtedness related to our acquisition of rb foods 

our working capital management – principally related to inventory trade accounts receivable and accounts payable – impacts our operating cash flow the change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations it was a use of cash in 2020 2019 and 2018 the change in trade accounts receivable was a source of cash in 2020 2019 and 2018 the change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in all three years 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decreases in ccc in 2020 from 2019 and in 2019 from 2018 were due in both instances to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers as more fully described below and to a lesser extent by a decrease in our days sales outstanding our ccc is also impacted by days in inventory which increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 and also in 2019 as compared to 2018 

prior to fiscal 2018 in response to evolving market practices we began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers we also initiated a supply chain finance program scf with several global financial institutions scf banks under the scf qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us to an scf bank these participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective scf bank while we are not party to those agreements the scf banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs this generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the scf and reaches an agreement with a scf bank the supplier elects which of our individual invoices they sell to the scf bank however all of our payments to participating suppliers are paid to the scf bank on the invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the scf bank 

the terms of our payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the scf our payment terms with our suppliers for similar materials within individual markets are consistent between those suppliers that elect to participate in the scf and those suppliers that do not participate accordingly our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the scf for our participating suppliers we believe substantially all of their receivables with us are sold to the scf banks accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to scf banks all outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the scf are recorded within the line entitled trade accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows as of november 30 2020 and 2019 the amount due to suppliers participating in the scf and included in trade accounts payable were approximately 2736 million and 2065 million respectively 

future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments such as changes in interest rates general market liquidity or our creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact those suppliers’ participation in the scf andor our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers however any such impacts are difficult to predict 

investing cash flow – net cash used in investing activities was 10256 million in 2020 1710 million in 2019 and 1585 million in 2018 our primary investing cash flows include the usage of cash associated with acquisition of businesses and capital expenditures cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses were 8030 million in 2020 and 42 million in 2018 capital expenditures including expenditures for capitalized software were 2253 million in 2020 1737 million in 2019 and 1691 million in 2018 we expect 2021 capital expenditures to approximate 265 million to support our planned growth including the multiyear program to replace our erp system and other initiatives 

financing cash flow – net cash associated with financing activities was a source of cash of 2209 million in 2020 net cash used in financing activities was 7258 million in 2019 and 7511 million in 2018 the variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings share repurchase activity and dividends all as described below 

the following table outlines our net borrowing activities 



in 2020 we borrowed 5270 million under longterm borrowing arrangements including net proceeds of 4950 million of 25 notes due april 2030 we also repaid 2577 million of longterm debt including 2500 million associated with our term loans due in august 2020 

in 2019 we repaid 4477 million of longterm debt including 4363 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 

in 2018 we borrowed 259 million under longterm borrowing arrangements in 2018 we repaid 7979 million of longterm debt including the 250 million 575 notes that matured on december 15 2017 and 5450 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 

through november 30 2020 we have repaid in full the 15000 million term loans issued in connection with our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 with a total of 12750 million of those term loans repaid in advance of their scheduled maturities which were in august 2020 and august 2022 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 



as of november 30 2020 585 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in november 2019 the timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors as a result of the increased level of indebtedness related to the acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 we curtailed our share repurchase activity since that time although we have curtailed our share repurchase activity we repurchased shares in 2020 2019 and 2018 to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options as a result of the additional indebtedness associated with our acquisitions of cholula and fona we expect to continue the curtailment of share repurchase activity in fiscal 2021 while also continuing to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we received proceeds of 566 million 909 million and 782 million respectively from exercised stock options we repurchased 130 million 127 million and 116 million of common stock during 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in conjunction with employee tax withholding requirements associated with our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2020 the board of directors approved an 97 increase in the quarterly dividend from 031 to 034 per share 

the following table presents our leverage ratios for the years ended november 30 2020 2019 and 2018 



1 the leverage ratio covenant in our revolving credit facilities provides that adjusted ebitda under that covenant also include the pro forma impact of acquisitions as applicable as of november 30 2020 our leverage ratio under the terms of those revolving credit facilities including the pro forma impact of acquisitions was 35 

our leverage ratio was 36 as of november 30 2020 as compared to the ratios of 34 and 40 as of november 30 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in our leverage ratio from 34 as of november 30 2019 to 36 as of november 30 2020 is principally due to an increase in total debt associated with the funding of our acquisition of cholula which was partially offset by an increase in adjusted ebitda 

the decrease in the ratio from 40 as of november 30 2018 to 34 as of november 30 2019 is principally due to an increase in our adjusted ebitda which was driven by higher operating income in 2019 as compared to 2018 in addition the ratio was favorably impacted by our lower level of net debt at november 30 2019 as compared to the prior yearend 

in early fiscal 2021 following our acquisition of fona the levels specified in our revolving credit facilities under which we are required to maintain our leverage ratios were amended by the participating banks to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratios as amended the maximum permitted leverage ratios under the terms of those revolving credit facilities including the pro form impact of acquisitions is 45 as of the measurement date at the end of each fiscal quarter in the year ending november 30 2021 that maximum ratio drops to 425 on february 28 2022 and drops to 375 for each fiscal quarter for the remaining term of the facility at the same time in early fiscal 2021 a similar amendment was made to our synthetic lease agreement for a tobeconstructed distribution center which contains covenants consistent with our revolving credit facilities 

most of our cash is in our subsidiaries outside of the us we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed prior to the enactment of the us tax act on december 22 2017 the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our nonus subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions as of november 30 2020 we have 13 billion of earnings from our nonus subsidiaries and joint ventures that are considered indefinitely reinvested while federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the us tax act we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes state income taxes or foreign exchange gains or losses it is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings 

at november 30 2020 we temporarily used 1000 million of cash from our nonus subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us during the year our shortterm borrowings vary but are lower at the end of a year or quarter the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2020 and 2019 were 5181 million and 8486 million respectively those average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the year ended november 30 2020 included average commercial paper outstanding of 4520 million the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2020 and 2019 was 43274 million and 47538 million respectively 

see notes 6 and 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in august 2017 we entered into a fiveyear 10 billion revolving credit facility which will expire in august 2022 the current pricing for the credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 125 the pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to libor plus 175 in december 2020 we entered into a 364day 10 billion revolving credit facility which will expire in december 2021 the current pricing for that 364day credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 125 the pricing of the 364day credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to libor plus 175 in early fiscal 2021 following our acquisition of fona the levels specified in our revolving credit facilities under which we are required to maintain our leverage ratios were amended by the participating banks to increase the permitted maximum leverage ratios our longterm target for our leverage ratio is 15 to 20 our leverage ratio can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity 

we generally use these revolving credit facilities to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facilities these facilities are made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital we engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments in addition to our committed revolving credit facilities we have uncommitted facilities of 3166 million as of november 30 2020 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders discretion see note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements 

we will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest to service debt and to fund acquisitions to meet those cash requirements we intend to use our existing cash cash equivalents and internally generated funds to borrow under our existing credit facilities or under other shortterm borrowing facilities and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular acquisition to our thenavailable sources of funds to obtain additional short and longterm financing we believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months we recently funded the cholula and fona acquisitions with cash and shortterm borrowings principally under commercial paper we will continue to monitor our liquidity and may seek to obtain additional longterm financing to further support our business 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash contributions to pension plans including unfunded plans were 119 million in 2020 114 million in 2019 and 135 million in 2018 it is expected that the 2021 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 100 million future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 59 of assets are invested in equities 31 in fixed income investments and 10 in other investments assets associated with our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60 in equities and 40 in fixed income investments see note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under the heading market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits 

in early fiscal 2021 we purchased fona the purchase price was approximately 710 million net of cash acquired subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments fona is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food beverage and nutritional markets our acquisition of fona on december 30 2020 expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories as well as extends our technology platform and strengthens our capabilities the acquisition was funded with cash and shortterm borrowings 

on november 30 2020 we purchased cholula for approximately 803 million net of cash acquired subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments the acquisition was funded with cash and shortterm borrowings cholula a premium mexican hot sauce brand is a strong addition to mccormick’s global branded flavor portfolio which broadens the company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic mexican flavor hot sauce the results of cholula’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition 

we did not have any acquisitions in fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2018 we purchased the remaining 10 minority ownership interest in our shanghai subsidiary for a cash payment of 127 million 

see notes 2 and 19 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign exchange risk – we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso swiss franc chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling and australian dollar and finally the canadian dollar versus british pound sterling we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2020 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling euro polish zloty chinese yuan australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso 

we also utilize cross currency interest rate swap contracts which are designated as net investment hedges to manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling and euro gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2020 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2020 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2020 



we had a number of smaller contracts at november 30 2020 with an aggregate notional value of 211 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the romanian leu russian ruble and singapore dollar the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 01 million at november 30 2020 

at november 30 2019 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty swiss franc and other currencies with a notional value of 4892 million the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of 03 million at november 30 2019 

we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are considered net investment hedges as of november 30 2020 we had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of i 250 million notional value to receive 250 million at threemonth us libor plus 0685 and pay £1941 million at threemonth gbp libor plus 0740 and ii £1941 million notional value to receive £1941 million at threemonth gbp libor plus 0740 and pay €2218 million at threemonth euro euribor plus 0808 we entered into these crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts which expire in august 2027 in early fiscal 2019 for more information refer to note 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk – our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2020 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

years of maturity at november 30 2020 



the table above displays the debt including capital leases by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects 

• we issued 250 million of 390 notes due in 2021 in july 2011 forward treasury lock agreements settled upon the issuance of these notes in 2011 effectively set the interest rate on the 250 million notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 401 

• we issued 250 million of 350 notes due in 2023 in august 2013 forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 330 

• we issued 250 million of 325 notes due in 2025 in november 2015 forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 345 the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 325 notes due in december 2025 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025 net interest payments are based on 3month libor plus 122 during this period 

• we issued an aggregate amount of 25 billion of senior unsecured notes in august 2017 these notes are due as follows 750 million due august 15 2022 700 million due august 15 2024 750 million due august 15 2027 and 300 million due august 15 2047 with stated fixed interest rates of 270 315 340 and 420 respectively forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of the 750 million notes due august 15 2027 effectively set the interest rate on these 750 million notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 344 the fixed interest rate on 250 million of the 340 notes due in 2027 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2027 net interest payments are based on 3month libor plus 0685 during this period 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2020 our most significant raw materials were dairy products pepper vanilla capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice and wheat flour while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2020 and 2019 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer arrangements known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments such as trade discounts rebates or returns are estimated at the time of sale where applicable future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding these programs key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a oneyear or shorter duration estimates that affect revenue such as trade incentives and product returns are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2020 we had 49863 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 37112 million in the consumer segment and 12751 million in the flavor solutions segment included in those amounts are 4105 million 2737 million in the consumer segment and 1368 million in the flavor solutions segment of goodwill related to our acquisition of cholula that as of november 30 2020 was determined on a preliminary basis the final valuation of the acquired net assets of cholula and the related goodwill balance by segment will be completed in 2021our fiscal year 2020 impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we estimate fair values primarily through the use of the relieffromroyalty method and then compare those fair values to the related carrying amounts of the indefinitelived intangible asset in the event that the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks are less than their related carrying amounts a noncash impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 

the estimation of fair values of our brand names and trademarks requires us to make significant assumptions including expectations with respect to sales and profits of the respective brands and trademarks related royalty rates and appropriate discount rates which are based in part upon current interest rates adjusted for our view of reasonable country and brand  specific risks based upon the past and anticipated future performance of the related brand names and trademarks  

as of november 30 2020 we had 30300 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date of the 30300 million of brand names assets and trademarks as of november 30 2020 i 23200 million relates to the french’s frank’s redhot and cattlemen’s brand names and trademarks recognized as part of our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 that we group for purposes of our impairment analysis ii 3800 million relates to the cholula brand names and trademarks recognized as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition of cholula in november 2020 and iii the remaining 3300 million represents a number of other brand name assets and trademarks with individual carrying values ranging from 02 million to 1064 million the percentage excess of estimated fair value over respective book values for each of our brand names and trademarks including the 23200 million related to our french’s franks redhot and cattlemen’s brands was 20 or more as of november 30 2020 except for i the cholula brand whose preliminary fair value of 3800 million was determined as of its november 30 2020 acquisition date and ii one additional brand with a carrying value of 74 million whose fair value modestly exceeds its carrying value as of yearend 2020 

the brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions including our recent acquisitions of cholula and in early fiscal 2021 fona may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values a change in assumptions with respect to recently acquired businesses including those affected by rising interest rates or a deterioration in expectations of future sales profitability or royalty rates as well as future economic and market conditions or higher income tax rates could result in noncash impairment losses in the future 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have 

recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2021 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 1 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2021 pension expense by approximately 10 million 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in addition see note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products the most significant of which is mccormick de mexico our major sales distribution and production facilities are located in north america europe and china additional facilities are based in australia india central america thailand and south africa mccormick  company incorporated was formed in 1915 under maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889 

in august 2017 we completed the acquisition of reckitt benckisers food division rb foods from reckitt benckiser group plc the purchase price was approximately 421 billion net of acquired cash of 243 million the acquired marketleading brands of rb foods include french’s ®  frank’s redhot ® and cattlemen’s ®  which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio we believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive us condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments at the time of the acquisition annual sales of rb foods were approximately 570 million the results of rb foods’ operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition 

business segments 

we operate in two business segments consumer and flavor solutions demand for flavor is growing globally and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions our products deliver flavor when cooking at home dining out purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack we offer our customers and consumers a range of products to meet the increasing demand for certain product attributes such as organic reduced sodium glutenfree and nongmo genetically modified organisms and that extend from premium to valuepriced 

consistent with market conditions in each segment our consumer segment has a higher overall profit margin than our flavor solutions segment in 2019 the consumer segment contributed approximately 61 of sales and 69 of operating income and the flavor solutions segment contributed approximately 39 of sales and 31 of operating income 

consumer segment from locations around the world our brands reach consumers in approximately 150 countries and territories our leading brands in the americas include mccormick ®  french’s ®  frank’s redhot ®  lawry’s ® and club house ®  as well as brands such as gourmet garden ® and old bay ®  we also market authentic regional and ethnic brands such as zatarain’s ®  stubbs ®  thai kitchen ® and simply asia ®  in the europe middle east and africa emea region our major brands include the ducros ®  schwartz ®  kamis ® and drogheria  alimentari ® brands of spices herbs and seasonings and an extensive line of vahiné ® brand dessert items in china we market our products under the mccormick and daqiao ® brands in australia we market our spices and seasonings under the mccormick brand our dessert products under the aeroplane ® brand and packaged chilled herbs under the gourmet garden brand in india we market our spices and rice products under the kohinoor ® brand elsewhere in the asiapacific region we market our products under the mccormick brand as well as other brands 

our customers span a variety of retailers that include grocery mass merchandise warehouse clubs discount and drug stores and ecommerce retailers served directly and indirectly through distributors or wholesalers in addition to marketing our branded products to these customers we are also a leading supplier of private label items also known as store brands 

approximately half of our consumer segment sales are spices herbs and seasonings for these products we are a category leader in our primary markets there are numerous competitive brands of spices herbs and seasonings in the us and additional brands in international markets some are owned by large food manufacturers while others are supplied by small privatelyowned companies in this competitive environment we are leading with innovation and brand marketing and applying our analytical tools to help customers optimize the profitability of their spice and seasoning sales while simultaneously working to increase our sales and profit 

flavor solutions segment in our flavor solutions segment we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers the foodservice customers are supplied with branded packaged products both directly and indirectly through distributors we supply food manufacturers and foodservice customers with customized flavor solutions and many of these customer relationships have been active for decades our range of flavor solutions remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends spices and herbs condiments coating systems and compound flavors in addition to a broad range of flavor solutions our longstanding customer relationships are evidence of our effectiveness in building customer intimacy our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas including sensory testing culinary research food safety and flavor application 

our flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach other competitors include larger publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature but which also tend to specialize in a narrower range of flavor solutions than mccormick 

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products vanilla pepper capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice and wheat flour  pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced locally either within the united states or from our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program 

customers 

our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers wholesalers and distributors in the consumer segment products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels including grocery mass merchandise warehouse clubs discount and drug stores and ecommerce in the flavor solutions segment products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods customers for the flavor solutions segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors 

we have a large number of customers for our products sales to one of our consumer segment customers walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 11 of consolidated sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 sales to one of our flavor solutions segment customers pepsico inc accounted for approximately 10 in 2019 and 2018 and 11 of consolidated sales in 2017 in 2019 2018 and 2017 the top three customers in our flavor solutions segment represented between 49 and 52 of our global flavor solutions sales 

the dollar amount of backlog orders for our business is not material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we own a number of trademark registrations although in the aggregate these trademarks are material to our business the loss of any one of those trademarks with the exception of our “mccormick” “french’s ” “frank’s redhot” “lawry’s” “zatarain’s” “stubbs” “club house” “ducros” “schwartz” “vahiné” old bay simply asia thai kitchen kitchen basics “kamis” “drogheria  alimentari” daqiao “kohinoor” and gourmet garden trademarks would not have a material adverse effect on our business the “mc – mccormick” trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the us and certain nonus markets the terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful 

we have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and nonaffiliated entities the loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business the term of the license agreements is generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties 

we also own various patents none of which are individually material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis” 

competition 

each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive in this competitive environment our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights additionally in the consumer segment we are building brand recognition and loyalty through advertising and promotions 

governmental regulation

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves risks including the risks described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to governmentimposed actions we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing such as the emergence of new sales channels like ecommerce and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business our flavor solutions segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our flavor solutions segment declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 21 of our consolidated sales in 2019  the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products vanilla pepper capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice and wheat flour  while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our cci program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacturing storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment consumer protection competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors 

and retailers foreign supplier verification customs and trade laws including the import and export of products and product ingredients employment and health and safety enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

in addition there are various compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals including such obligations required by the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which came into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which came into effect in january 2020 these types of data privacy laws create a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals and increases financial penalties for noncompliance for example the ccpa imposes requirements on companies that do business in california and collect personal information from customers including notice consent and service provider requirements the ccpa also provides for civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements as well as a private right of action for data breaches regulations to implement portions of the ccpa have not been finalized and could significantly impact ccpa compliance measures as a company that is subject to data privacy laws we bear the costs of compliance with them including the gdpr and ccpa and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of these laws which continue to evolve these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could adversely affect our results 

as of november 30 2019 we had approximately 45 billion of goodwill and approximately 26 billion of other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise we test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill to the units fair value similarly we test indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values if the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets exceed their fair value the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to their implied fair value or fair value respectively factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates operating margins weighted average cost of capital future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates the impairment of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 

because indefinitelived intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition of the related business indefinitelived intangible assets associated with recent business acquisitions particularly those acquired in recent low interest rate environments such as rb foods are more susceptible to impairment in periods of rising interest rates than indefinitelived intangible assets related to businesses acquired in periods of higher interest rates 

our foreign and crossborder operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2019 approximately 40 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties several countries within the european union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union and the united kingdom uk additionally international sales together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the us are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may negatively impact our operations 

the uk is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the european union “brexit” in november 2018 the uk and the european union agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement that sets out the terms of the uk’s departure including commitments on citizen rights after brexit a financial settlement from the uk and a transition period to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed after the uk parliament failed to approve the withdrawal agreement in october 2019 european union leaders granted the uk a threemonth flexible brexit extension avoiding a nodeal exit on the previous deadline of october 31 2019 on january 23 2020 the withdrawal act after clearing all stages in the uk parliament received royal assent from the queen assuming approval by the european parliament the uk is expected to officially leave the european union on january 31 2020 following its departure the uk will enter a transition period until december 31 2020 during which period of time the uk’s trading relationship with the european union will remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a free trade agreement as well as other aspects of the uk’s relationship with the european union the withdrawal 

agreement allows the ukeuropean union joint committee to extend the transition period by up to two years meaning that the terms and eventual date of the uk’s withdrawal remain highly uncertain 

if the uk leaves the european union with no agreement “hard brexit” it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further shortterm uncertainty and currency volatility in the absence of a future trade deal the uk’s trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization current volatility and tariffs and duties on trade may also occur under any trade agreement negotiated between the uk and the european union depending on the agreements terms additionally under a hard brexit or a negotiated trade agreement the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the european union may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure these changes to the trading relationship between the uk and european union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the uk and may decrease the profitability of our uk and other operations additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound which increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations a weaker british pound versus the us dollar also causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars during a reporting period with a range of outcomes still possible the impact from brexit remains uncertain and will depend in part on the final outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations 

increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us 

on november 30 2019 we had total outstanding variable rate debt of approximately 882 million  including 601 million of shortterm borrowings at a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 26 the interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on our credit ratings our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital 

our credit ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions if our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

we have incurred additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of rb foods and may not be able to meet our debt service requirements 

after financing our acquisition of rb foods we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as of november 30 2019 the indebtedness of mccormick and its subsidiaries is approximately 43 billion this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 



the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the uncertainty regarding the potential phaseout of libor may negatively impact our operating results 

libor the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out after 2021 when privatesector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate without this data libor may no longer be published or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates will become accepted alternatives to libor although the us federal reserve in connection with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” sofr is a more generic measure than libor and considers the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities given the inherent differences between libor and sofr or any other alternative benchmark rate that may be established there are many uncertainties regarding a transition from libor including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with libor as the referenced rate and how this will impact the company’s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments the company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language as published by the alternative reference rates committee the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business we rely on our information technology systems some of which are or may be managed or hosted by or outsourced to third party service providers to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems and infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades or oversee third party service providers our business or financial results could be negatively impacted the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction or reporting errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems are subject to cyberattacks or other security incidents service disruptions or other system or process failures such incidents could result in unauthorized access to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data as well as disruptions to operations we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents although to date none has been material to address the risks to our information technology systems and data we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology developing security policies and procedures implementing and assessing the effectiveness of controls conducting risk assessments of third party service providers and designing business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident it may have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and we may experience other adverse consequences such as loss of assets remediation costs litigation regulatory investigations and the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes and functions which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

if we are not able to successfully implement our business transformation initiative or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted 

we continue to implement our multiyear business transformation initiative to execute significant change to our global processes capabilities and operating model including in our global enablement ge organization in order to provide a scalable platform for future growth while reducing costs as technology provides the backbone for greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we are also making investments in our information systems including the multiyear program to replace our enterprise resource planning erp system currently underway which includes the transformation of our financial processing systems to enterprisewide systems solutions these systems implementations are part of our ongoing business transformation initiative and we plan to implement these systems throughout all parts of our businesses if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of our business which could result in the loss of customers and revenue in addition failure to either deliver the applications on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue in connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls including our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting 

we utilize cloudbased services and systems and networks managed by thirdparty vendors to process transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees customers vendors and other third parties our utilization of these cloudbased services and systems will increase as we implement our business transformation initiatives if any of these thirdparty service providers or vendors do not perform effectively or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance including compliance with servicelevel agreements or regulatory or legal requirements we may not be able to achieve expected cost savings we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting litigation or remediation costs or damage to our reputation which could have a 

negative impact on employee morale in addition the management of multiple thirdparty service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control 

the global nature of our business changes in tax legislation and the resolution of tax uncertainties create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions and exit certain businesses or lines of business these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the declaration payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors 

the declaration payment and amount of any dividends is made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant including our financial position results of operations available cash resources cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders our dividend payments are subject to solvency conditions established by the maryland general corporation law accordingly there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our board of directors will not decide to reduce suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and flavor solutions as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 and increase adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 

sales growth  over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support customer intimacy expanded distribution and category growth 2 new products and 3 acquisitions 

base business –we expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed quality and effectiveness we measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support through digital marketing we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes provide cooking advice and discover new products 

new products –for our consumer segment we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition including private label we are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion from gourmet premium items to convenient and valuepriced flavors 

for flavor solutions customers we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products as well as flavors for new menu items we have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans many of which include “betterforyou” innovation with over 20 product innovation centers around the world we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers

the rb foods acquisition resulted in acquisitions contributing more than onethird of our sales growth in 2018 and 2017 

cost savings and business transformation  we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

we are making investments to build the mccormick of the future including in our global enablement ge organization to transform mccormick through globally aligned innovative services to enable growth as more fully described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements we expect to incur special charges of approximately 60 million to 65 million associated with our ge initiative of which approximately 38 million have been recognized through november 30 2019 as technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we are also making investments in our information systems in 2019 we have progressed in implementing our global enterprise resource planning erp replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth we expect that in total over the course of the erp replacement program from late 2018 through 2022 we will invest from approximately 300 million to 350 million including expenses related to the golive activities in our operations to enable the anticipated completion of the global roll out of our new information technology platform in 2022 of that projected 300 million to 350 million we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 40 and program expenses to account for approximately 60 of the approximately 180 million to 210 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending related to our erp replacement program approximately 20 million have been recognized through november 30 2019 

the ge initiative is expected to generate annual savings ranging from approximately 45 million to 55 million once all actions are implemented including those that are dependent on the replacement of our global erp platform 

cash flow  we continue to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 9468 million in 2019 an increase of 1256 million from the 8212 million realized in 2018 in 2019 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 34 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases in 2019 the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was 3973 million 

on a longterm basis we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2019 we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 08 over the 2018 level due to the following factors 

 

operating income was 9577 million in 2019 and 8911 million in 2018 we recorded 208 million and 163 million of special charges in 2019 and 2018 respectively related to organization and streamlining actions in 2018 we also recorded 225 million of transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of rb foods that reduced operating income in 2019 compared to the yearago period the favorable impact of higher sales 1189 million of cost savings from our cci program including organization and streamlining actions and the impact of the previously mentioned 2018 integration costs more than offset increased conversion costs higher stockbased compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates excluding special charges together with for 2018 transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of rb foods adjusted operating income was 9785 million in 2019 an increase of 52 compared to 9299 million in the yearago period in constant currency adjusted operating income rose 67 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see nongaap financial measures 

diluted earnings per share was 524 in 2019 and 700 in 2018 the yearonyear decrease in earnings per share was driven mainly by the significant reduction in the nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act and to a much smaller extent by a higher amount of shares outstanding and by increased special charges in 2019 as compared to 2018 those unfavorable impacts in 2019 were partially offset by higher operating income as previously described by the absence of transaction and integration expenses by lower interest expense and by higher income from unconsolidated operations in 2019 as compared to 2018 special charges lowered earnings per share by 012 and 010 in 2019 and 2018 respectively transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by 013 in 2018 a nonrecurring benefit from the us tax act increased diluted earnings per share by 001 and 226 in 2019 and 2018 respectively excluding the effects of special charges transaction and integration expenses and the nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act adjusted diluted earnings per share was 535 in 2019 and 497 in 2018 or an increase of 76 

2020 outlook 

we are wellpositioned for another year of underlying solid performance in 2020 in 2020 we expect to grow net sales 2 to 4 over 2019’s net sales of 53474 million that anticipated 2020 sales growth is primarily driven by new products brand marketing expanded distribution and the impact of pricing actions which in conjunction with cost savings are expected to offset an anticipated midsingle digit cost increase that increase consists entirely of organic growth as we do not currently anticipate an incremental sales impact from acquisitions in 2020 we expect our 2020 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75 basis points higher in 2020 than in 2019 in part driven by our cciled cost savings 

in 2020 we expect operating income compared to 2019’s operating income of 9577 million to range from comparable to an increase of 2 that range includes an estimated 600 basis point unfavorable impact from expenses related to the investment in our global erp replacement our expectations for 2020 operating income reflect the impact of lower special charges estimated at 8 million in 2020 compared to 208 million in 2019 excluding special charges but including the estimated 600 basis point unfavorable impact from expenses related to our global erp investment we expect 2020’s adjusted operating income compared to 2019’s adjusted operating income of 9785 million to range from a decline of 1 to an increase of 1 our cciled cost savings target in 2020 is approximately 105 million in 2020 we expect to support our sales growth with a midsingledigit increase in brand marketing 

our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2020 than in 2019 absent the projected impact of discrete tax items we estimate our underlying tax rate to be approximately 24 in 2020 including the projected impact of estimated discrete tax items including the favorable impact of a discrete item that occurred in december 2019 we estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate 22 in fiscal 2020 excluding the nonrecurring benefit of 15 million associated with the us tax act and taxes associated with special charges recognized in fiscal 2019 our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 195 in 2019 we expect our adjusted effective tax rate in 2020 to approximate our effective tax rate under us gaap of 22 

diluted earnings per share was 524 in 2019 diluted earnings per share for 2020 are projected to range from 515 to 525 excluding the per share impact of the nonrecurring benefit from the us tax act of 001 and special charges of 012 in 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 535 in 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding an estimated 005 per share impact from special charges are projected to be 520 to 530 in 2020 our projected adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2020 which ranges from a decline of 3 to a decline of 1 from adjusted diluted earnings per share of 535 in 2019 includes an approximate 700 basis point impact from the expenses associated with our erp replacement program and a higher adjusted effective tax rate in 2020 

in 2020 we expect minimal impact of foreign currency as compared to 2019 levels on our projections of net sales operating income and diluted earnings per share as well as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share 

results of operations—2019 compared to 2018 



sales for 2019 increased by 08 from 2018 and by 27 on a constant currency basis both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 25 to sales this was driven by product innovation as well as growth in the base business pricing actions added 02 to sales these factors were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 19 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 27 on a constant currency basis 



in 2019 our gross profit margin increased 60 basis points to 401 from 395 in 2018 driven by the favorable impact of cciled cost savings partially offset by unfavorable conversion costs 



selling general and administrative sga expense was 11668 million in 2019 compared to 11634 million in 2018 an increase of 34 million that increase in sga expense was driven by increased stockbased compensation expense and higher distribution costs partially offset by cciled cost savings sga expense in 2019 also reflected the impact of two significant but largely offsetting items i expenses associated with our investment in a global erp platform in support of our ge business transformation initiative that increased sga expense over the prior year level and ii a onetime fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that decreased sga expense from the prior year level as a result of the above factors over an increased net sales base sga expense as a percentage of net sales was 218 a 20basis point improvement from 2018 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizational structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our management committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements 

during 2019 we recorded 208 million of special charges consisting primarily of i 141 million of costs related to our multiyear ge business transformation initiative including 106 million of thirdparty expenses 21 million related to severance and related benefits and 14 million related to other costs ii 23 million of severance and related benefits associated with streamlining actions in the americas and iii 39 million related to streamlining actions in our emea region 

during 2018 we recorded 163 million of special charges consisting primarily of i 115 million related to our multiyear ge business transformation initiative consisting of 75 million of third party expenses 10 million of employee severance charges and a noncash asset impairment charge of 30 million which noncash asset impairment charge was related to the writeoff of certain software assets that are incompatible with our move to the new global erp platform ii a onetime payment in the aggregate amount of 22 million made to eligible us hourly employees to distribute a portion of the nonrecurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the us tax act iii 10 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs directly 

associated with the relocation of one of our chinese manufacturing facilities and iv 16 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations in our asiapacific region to a newly constructed facility in thailand 



transaction and integration expenses related to the rb foods acquisition totaled 225 million for 2018 these costs primarily consisted of outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition 



operating income increased by 666 million or 75 from 8911 million in 2018 to 9577 million in 2019 an absence of transaction and integration expenses in 2019 compared to 225 million related to our acquisition of rb foods in 2018 more than offset a 45 million increase in special charges in 2019 from 163 million in 2018 to 208 million in 2019 operating income as a percent of net sales rose by 110 basis points in 2019 from 168 in 2018 to 179 in 2019 as a result of the factors previously described our operating income as a percent of net sales in 2019 was impacted by two large but substantially offsetting items i expenses associated with our investment in a global erp platform in support of our ge business transformation initiative that decreased operating income as a percent of sales by approximately 35 basis points in 2019 and ii a onetime fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that increased operating income as a percent of sales by approximately 40 basis points in 2019 excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described adjusted operating income was 9785 million in 2019 as compared to 9299 million in 2018 an increase of 486 million or 52 over the 2018 level adjusted operating income as a percent of sales rose by 80 basis points in 2019 from 175 in 2018 to 183 in 2019 



interest expense was 94 million lower for 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in average total borrowings other income net for 2019 increased by 19 million from the 2018 level due principally to higher nonservice cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans and higher interest income which was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a building which was reflected in our 2018 results and did not recur in 2019 



the provision for income taxes is based on the thencurrent estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period we record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of us gaap examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income of the current fiscal year include but are not limited to excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations provisiontoreturn adjustments and the settlement of tax audits and beginning in 2019 the tax effects of intraentity asset transfers other than inventory 

as more fully described in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements the us tax act was enacted in december 2017 the us tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries under gaap specifically asc topic 740 income taxes  the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax 

balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted we recorded a net benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act during 2018 this amount includes a 3800 million benefit from the revaluation of our net us deferred tax liabilities as of january 1 2018 based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset in part by an estimated net transition tax impact of 785 million that net transition tax impact is comprised of the mandated onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries estimated at 753 million together with additional foreign withholding taxes of 79 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the us tax act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018 less a 47 million reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes directly resulting from the transition tax in addition in 2019 we recorded a benefit of 15 million relating to an adjustment to a prior year tax accrual associated with the us tax act 

the effective tax rate was an expense of 192 in 2019 as compared to a benefit of 212 in 2018 the effective tax rate benefit of 212 in 2018 includes the nonrecurring net tax benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act as more fully described above that had a 407 impact on 2018’s effective tax rate net discrete tax benefits were 437 million in 2019 which is an increase of 156 million from 281 million in 2018 excluding the nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act in 2018 for 2019 the effective tax rate was impacted by 152 million of tax benefits associated with an intraentity asset transfer that occurred during 2019 under the provisions of asu no 201616 which we adopted on december 1 2018 discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 224 million and 217 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions the previously described nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act and other discrete items see note 12 of the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 61 million in 2019 from the prior year this increase was primarily attributable to the impact of higher earnings from our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico as well as the impact of eliminating a lower level of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2019 as compared to 2018 we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including mccormick de mexico that comprised 72 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2019 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 524 in 2019 compared to 700 in 2018 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2018 to 2019 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2019 



results of operations—segments 

we measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition see note 15 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment 

of operating income excluding special charges as well as transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition to consolidated operating income in the following discussion we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as segment operating income 

in 2019 the company transferred management responsibility for certain export operations in both its consumer and flavor solutions segments between geographies within each respective segment shifting from the americas to the asiapacific regions within each segment with no change in segment sales or segment operating income for either the consumer or flavor solutions segment in total the discussion that follows reflects the effect of that realignment of export operations for all periods presented 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment in 2019 grew by 07 as compared to 2018 and grew by 25 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 24 to sales and pricing actions added 01 these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced consumer segment sales by 18 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 25 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas consumer sales rose 24 in 2019 as compared to 2018 and rose by 27 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 27 to sales driven by new product sales as well as base business growth the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 03 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 27 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region consumer sales decreased 55 in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased 02 on a constant currency basis volume and product mix increased sales by 10 led by new products and promotions that were partially offset by declines in private label sales the impact of pricing actions reduced sales by 12 the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 53 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 02 on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 08 as compared to 2018 and increased 57 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 29 to sales led by strong sales in india and southeast asia pricing actions primarily in china added 28 to sales as compared to 2018 these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 49 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 57 on a constant currency basis 

we grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by 392 million or 61 in 2019 compared to 2018 the favorable impact of higher sales and cciled cost savings more than offset increased conversion costs on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 73 segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 110 basis points to 207 in 2019 from 196 in 2018 driven by an improvement in gross margin 

flavor solutions segment 

  



sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 11 in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased by 32 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 29 to sales and pricing actions added 03 these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced flavor solutions segment sales by 21 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 32 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas flavor solutions sales rose 22 in 2019 as compared to 2018 and rose 26 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 24 to sales and included growth in new products as well as in base business led by sales to packaged food companies pricing actions added 02 to sales in 2019 these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 04 in 2019 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 26 on a constant currency basis

in the asiapacific region flavor solutions sales decreased 34 in 2019 as compared to 2018 and increased 06 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 09 to sales and included increased sales to quick service restaurants partially offset by the exit of certain low margin business pricing actions reduced sales in 2019 by 03 these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 40 in 2019 compared to 2018 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 06 on a constant currency basis 

we grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by 94 million or 32 in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in segment operating income was driven by higher sales as well as lower sga costs on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment rose 53 segment operating income margin for our flavor solutions segment rose by 30 basis points to 145 in 2019 from 142 in 2018 and reflected the impact of lower sga costs as a percentage of net sales 

results of operations—2018 compared to 2017 



sales for 2018 increased by 121 from 2017 and by 109 on a constant currency basis both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 22 to sales in 2019 this was driven by new products as well as growth in the base business the incremental impact of pricing actions added 05 to sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition added 82 to sales during 2018 a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 12 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 109 on a constant currency basis 



in 2018 our gross profit margin rose 160 basis points to 395 from 379 in 2017 while this expansion in 2018 includes the accretive impact from our acquisition of the rb foods business together with the absence of related transaction and integration expenses of 209 million that depressed our 2017 gross profit margin by 50 basis points our core business was also a driver of that expansion in 2018 cciled cost savings and the shift in our core product portfolio to more valueadded products continued to drive profit expansion across both of our segments which was partially offset by an increase in freight costs during 2018 as compared to 2017 excluding the effect of those transaction and integration expenses in 2017 adjusted gross profit margin rose 110 basis points from 384 in 2017 to 395 in 2018 



selling general and administrative sga expense was 11634 million in 2018 compared to 10312 million in 2017 an increase of 1322 million that increase in sga expense was driven by the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition together with increased brand marketing and higher distribution costs which was offset in part by cciled cost savings including the benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements as a result sga expense as a percentage of net sales was 220 a 20basis point increase from 2017 



during 2018 we recorded 163 million of special charges consisting primarily of i 115 million related to our multiyear ge business transformation initiative consisting of 75 million of third party expenses 10 million of employee severance charges and a noncash asset impairment charge of 30 million that noncash asset impairment charge was related to the writeoff of certain software assets that are incompatible with our move to the new global erp platform ii a onetime payment in the aggregate amount of 22 million made to eligible us hourly employees to distribute a portion of the nonrecurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the us tax act iii 10 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs directly associated with the relocation of one of our chinese manufacturing facilities and iv 16 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations in our asiapacific region to a newly constructed facility in thailand 

during 2017 we recorded 222 million of special charges consisting primarily of 127 million related to third party expenses incurred as part of our evaluation of changes relating to our ge transformation initiative 28 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with the relocation of one of our chinese manufacturing facilities 25 million for severance and other exit costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in portugal and 17 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with actions related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to a new facility then under construction in thailand 



transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition totaled 225 million and 771 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2018 these costs primarily consisted of outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition in 2017 these expenses consisted of amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value adjustment of inventories of 209 million that was included in cost of goods sold outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition including the costs related to the bridge financing commitment of 154 million that was included in other debt costs 



operating income increased by 1913 million or 273 from 6998 million in 2017 to 8911 million in 2018 the change in operating income was impacted by i a 392 million decrease in transaction and integration expenses from 617 million in 2017 to 225 million in 2018 related to our acquisition of rb foods in 2018 and ii a 59 million decrease in special charges in 2018 as compared to 2017 operating income as a percent of net sales rose by 200 basis points in 2018 from 148 in 2017 to 168 in 2018 as a result of the factors previously described excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses adjusted operating income was 9299 million in 2018 as compared to 7837 million in 2017 an increase of 1462 million or 187 over the 2017 level adjusted operating income as a percent of sales rose by 90 basis points in 2018 from 166 in 2017 to 175 in 2018 



interest expense for 2018 of 1746 million was sharply higher than the prior year level primarily due to higher average borrowings in 2018 related to our incurrence of 37 billion in debt in august 2017 to finance the acquisition of rb foods see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements other income net for 2018 of 248 million was significantly higher than the 2017 level principally due to i a 96 million increase in income related to the nonservice component of our pension and other postretirement plans ii a gain of 63 million recognized on the sale in 2018 of a building vacated as part of our move to a new global headquarters in maryland iii higher interest income and iv lower nonoperating foreign currency transaction losses recognized in 2018 as compared to 2017 



as more fully described above and in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements the us tax act was enacted in december 2017 we recorded a net benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act during 2018 this amount included a 3800 million benefit from the revaluation of our net us deferred tax liabilities as of january 1 2018 based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset in part by an estimated net transition tax impact of 785 million that net transition tax impact was comprised of the mandated onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries estimated at 753 million together with additional foreign withholding taxes of 79 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the us tax act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018 less a 47 million reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes directly resulting from the transition tax 

the effective tax rate was a benefit of 212 in 2018 as compared to an effective tax rate expense of 254 in 2017 the effective tax rate benefit of 212 in 2018 includes the net tax benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act as more fully described above that had a 407 impact on 2018’s effective tax rate our 2018 effective tax rate also reflects the effects of the lower us federal corporate income tax rate under the us tax act and higher other net discrete tax benefits net discrete tax benefits excluding the effects of the us tax act in 2018 increased by 39 million from 242 million in 2017 to 281 million in 2018 discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 217 million and 107 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions and other discrete items including in 2017 the establishment of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred taxes see note 12 of the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations increased 09 million in 2018 from the prior year this increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings from our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico partially offset by the impact of a higher elimination of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2018 than in 2017 we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including mccormick de mexico which comprised 76 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2018 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 700 in 2018 compared to 372 in 2017 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2017 to 2018 the increase in operating income in the table below includes the impact from favorable currency exchange rates in 2018

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment in 2018 grew by 119 as compared to 2017 and grew by 105 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 17 to sales while the impact of 2018 pricing actions added 06 the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition added 82 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased consumer segment sales in 2018 by 14 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 105 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas consumer sales rose 134 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose by 133 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 06 to sales pricing actions added 10 to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions added 117 to sales the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales in 2018 by 01 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 133 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region consumer sales increased 69 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose 16 on a constant currency basis volume and product mix increased sales by 18 led by growth in france and export sales to developing markets this growth was partially offset by sales weakness in poland driven by competitive conditions the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition added 08 to sales while the impact of pricing actions reduced sales by 10 the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales in 2018 by 53 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales increase of 16 on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 115 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 90 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 67 to sales growth was led by china through product innovation and increased distribution partially offset by lower private label sales in australia pricing actions added 12 to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions added 11 to sales the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 25 in 2018 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 90 on a constant currency basis 

we grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by 747 million or 133 in 2018 compared to 2017 the favorable impact of greater sales and higher cciled cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher costs and brand marketing expense on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 124 segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 20 basis points to 196 in 2018 from 194 in 2017 the increase in segment operating income margin was driven by a higher gross profit margin and the leverage of fixed and semifixed elements of sga over the higher sales base in 2018 as compared to 2017 those factors were partially offset by an increase in sga as a percentage of sales driven by increased investment in brand marketing and higher distribution costs the previously described gross profit margin improvement includes the incremental accretive impact attributable to the rb foods acquisition as well as expansion in our core business in part from cciled cost savings and favorable product mix 

flavor solutions segment 



sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 124 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased by 116 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 31 to sales and pricing actions added 03 flavor solutions segment sales rose in 2018 due to the incremental impact of acquisitions primarily the rb foods acquisition which added 82 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased flavor solutions segment sales in 2018 by 08 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 116 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas flavor solutions sales rose 151 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose 150 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 31 to sales led by increased sales to several large custom 

flavor solutions customers partially offset by the impact from a global realignment of a major customers sales to emea together with the exit of certain lower margin business pricing actions added 02 to sales and the incremental impact of our rb foods acquisition added 117 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 01 in 2018 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 150 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region flavor solutions sales increased 86 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 63 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 41 to sales driven by increased sales to quick service restaurants broad based growth in turkey and the previously described global realignment of a major customers sales from the americas to emea pricing actions added 10 to sales in 2018 and the incremental impact of the giotti and rb foods acquisitions added 12 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 23 in 2018 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 63 on a constant currency basis

we grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by 715 million or 323 in 2018 compared to 2017 the increase in segment operating income was due to the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition coupled with cciled cost savings on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment rose 323 segment operating income margin for our flavor solutions segment rose by 210 basis points to 142 in 2018 from 121 in 2017 and was driven by a higher gross profit margin offset in part by higher sga as a percentage of net sales which reflects higher distribution costs 

nongaap financial measures 

the following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit adjusted operating income adjusted income tax expense adjusted income tax rate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles these financial measures exclude the impact as applicable of the following 



acquisition and related costs and therefore the impact on the comparability of our results distinguishes it from our past recent and smaller acquisitions the costs of which have not been excluded from our nongaap financial measures 

 details with respect to the composition of transaction and integration expenses including other debt costs special charges and nonrecurring income tax benefits associated with the us tax act recorded for the years and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2 3 and 12 respectively of the accompanying financial statements 

we believe that these nongaap financial measures are important the exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

these nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting 

a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 







because we are a multinational company we are subject to variability of our reported us dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis” is a nongaap measure we believe that this nongaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the us it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows 1 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2019 on a constant currency basis net sales and adjusted operating income for 2019 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2018 and compared to the reported results for 2018 and 2 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2018 on a constant currency basis net sales and operating income for 2018 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2017 and compared to the reported results for 2017 

  





to present the percentage change in projected 2020 sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis 2020 projected local currency sales adjusted operating income and adjusted net income for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at currently prevailing exchange rates and are compared to those 2020 local currency projected results translated into us dollars at the average actual exchange rates in effect during the corresponding months in fiscal year 2019 to determine what the 2020 consolidated us dollar sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share would have been if the relevant currency exchange rates had not changed from those of the comparable prioryear periods in 2020 we expect minimal impact of foreign currency as compared to 2019 levels on our projections of net sales operating income and diluted earnings per share as well as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share 

in addition to the above nongaap financial measures we use a leverage ratio which is determined using nongaap measures a leverage ratio is a widelyused measure of ability to repay outstanding debt obligations and is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating financial leverage we believe that our leverage ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage although our method to calculate our leverage ratio may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate such a leverage ratio we determine our leverage ratio as net debt which we define as total debt net of cash in excess of 750 million to adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses for interest income taxes depreciation and amortization less interest income and as further adjusted for cash and noncash acquisitionrelated expenses which may include the effect of the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory on cost of goods sold special charges stockbased compensation expenses and certain gains or losses which may include third party fees and expenses and integration costs adjusted ebitda and our leverage ratio are both nongaap financial measures our determination of the leverage ratio is consistent with the terms of our 10 billion revolving credit facility and our term loans which require us to maintain our leverage ratio below certain levels under those agreements the applicable leverage ratio is reduced annually as of november 30 2019 our capacity under the revolving credit facility is not affected by these covenants we do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future however the leverage ratio could restrict our ability to utilize this facility we expect to comply with this financial covenant for the foreseeable future 

the following table reconciles our net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended november 30 



  



our longterm target for our leverage ratio is 15 to 20 our leverage ratio can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity 

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives service our debt increase our dividend fund capital projects and other investments and make share repurchases when appropriate due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business we generate much of our cash flow in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2019 the exchange rates for the euro australian dollar polish zloty and chinese renminbi were lower versus the us dollar than at november 30 2018 at november 30 2019 the exchange rates for the british pound sterling and canadian dollar were higher versus the us dollar than at november 30 2018 

operating cash flow – operating cash flow was 9468 million in 2019 8212 million in 2018 and 8153 million in 2017 the increases in cash flow from operations in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to higher net income exclusive of the 2018 impact of the noncash nonrecurring net income tax benefit of 3094 million related to the us tax act in addition as more fully described below our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow in 2019 2018 and 2017 in 2019 the increases to operating cash flow were partially offset by a use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities totaling 815 million in 2018 those increases were partially offset by a higher use of cash from other operating assets and liabilities partially related to the timing of our payment of transaction and integration expenses as well as of interest on indebtedness related to our acquisition of 

rb foods as compared to the source of cash in 2017 dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates which were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 and higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 also impacted our cash flow from operations 

our working capital management – principally related to inventory trade accounts receivable and accounts payable – impacts our operating cash flow the change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations it was a use of cash in 2019 and 2018 and a source of cash in 2017 the change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years as well as it was a source of cash in 2019 and 2018 and a use of cash in 2017 the change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in all three years 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decreases in ccc in 2019 from 2018 and in 2018 from 2017 were due in both instances to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers and to a lesser extent by a decrease in our days sales outstanding our ccc is also impacted by days in inventory which increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased in 2018 as compared to 2017 

investing cash flow – net cash used in investing activities was 1710 million in 2019 1585 million in 2018 and 45083 million in 2017 our primary investing cash flows include the usage of cash associated with acquisition of businesses and capital expenditures cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses were 42 million in 2018 and 43274 million in 2017 see note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further details related to our acquisition of rb foods capital expenditures including expenditures for capitalized software were 1737 million in 2019 1691 million in 2018 and 1824 million in 2017 we expect 2020 capital expenditures to approximate 265 million to support our planned growth including the multiyear program to replace our erp system and other initiatives 

financing cash flow – net cash used in financing activities was 7258 million in 2019 and 7511 million in 2018 net cash provided by financing activities was 37560 million in 2017 the variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings share repurchase activity and dividends all as described below 

in 2019 and 2018 our net borrowing activity used cash of 4067 million and 4665 million  respectively in 2017 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 35746 million  

in 2019 we increased our shortterm borrowings on a net basis by 410 million we also repaid 4477 million of longterm debt including 4363 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 of that 4363 million 3613 million represent prepayments through november 30 2019 we have repaid 12500 million of the 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 including prepayments of 10813 million 

in 2018 we increased our shortterm borrowings on a net basis by 3055 million and borrowed 259 million under longterm borrowing arrangements in 2018 we repaid 7979 million of longterm debt including the 250 million 575 notes that matured on december 15 2017 and 5450 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 

in 2017 we received 39776 million of net proceeds on the issuance of 40000 million of longterm debt including 25000 million of notes and 15000 million of term loans see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information with respect to this longterm debt we also paid 77 million of costs associated with the issuance of debt and our 10 billion revolving credit facility in 2017 we repaid 2727 million 

of longterm debt including 2688 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 in 2017 we repaid 1346 million of shortterm borrowings 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 



as of november 30 2019 32 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in march 2015 an additional 600 million share repurchase program was authorized by our board of directors in november 2019 the timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 

during 2019 2018 and 2017 we received proceeds of 909 million  782 million and 295 million respectively from exercised stock options we repurchased 127 million  116 million and 58 million of common stock during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in conjunction with employee tax withholding requirements associated with our stock compensation plans 

during 2017 we issued approximately 635 million shares of our common stock nonvoting to fund our acquisition of rb foods see notes 2 and 13 of the accompanying financial statements which included approximately 08 million shares from the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the net proceeds from this issuance after the underwriting discount and related expenses was 5540 million 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2019 the board of directors approved an 88 increase in the quarterly dividend from 057 to 062 per share 

the following table presents our leverage ratios for the years ended november 30 2019 2018 and 2017 



1 the leverage ratio covenant in our 10 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements both outstanding at november 30 2019 2018 and 2017 provide that adjusted ebitda under that covenant also include the pro forma impact of acquisitions as applicable as of november 30 2017 our leverage ratio under the terms of those agreements including the pro forma impact of acquisitions was 45 

our leverage ratio was 34 as of november 30 2019 as compared to the ratios of 40 and 51 as of november 30 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease in our leverage ratio from 40 as of november 30 2018 to 34 as of november 30 2019 is due to both an increase in our adjusted ebitda which was driven by higher operating income in 2019 as compared to 2018 as well as our lower level of net debt at november 30 2019 

the decrease in the ratio from 51 as of november 30 2017 to 40 as of november 30 2018 is principally due to an increase in our adjusted ebitda which was driven by higher operating income in 2018 as compared to 2017 in addition the ratio was favorably impacted by our lower level of net debt at november 30 2018 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed prior to the enactment of the us tax act on december 22 2017 the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions currently the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could still have adverse tax consequences related to the effects of withholding and other taxes at november 30 2019 we temporarily used 2628 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down short 

term debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2019 and 2018 were 8486 million and 7000 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2019 and 2018 was 47538 million and 50816 million respectively 

see notes 6 and 7 of the accompanying financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in august 2017 we entered into a fiveyear 10 billion revolving credit facility which will expire in august 2022 the current pricing for the credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 125 the pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to libor plus 175 this facility replaced our prior facilities i a fiveyear 750 million revolving credit facility that was due to expire in june 2020 and ii a 364day 250 million revolving facility which we entered into in the second quarter of 2017 and that was due to expire in march 2018 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities of 2615 million as of november 30 2019 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders discretion we engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash contributions to pension plans including unfunded plans were 114 million in 2019 135 million in 2018 and 187 million in 2017 it is expected that the 2020 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 120 million future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 59 of assets are invested in equities 31 in fixed income investments and 10 in other investments assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60 in equities and 40 in fixed income investments see note 10 of the accompanying financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits 

we did not have any acquisition activity in fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2018 we purchased the remaining 10 minority ownership interest in our shanghai subsidiary for a cash payment of 127 million 

in fiscal 2017 we made the following acquisitions 

 see note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions 

performance graph—shareholder return 

the following line graph compares the yearly change in mccormick’s cumulative total shareholder return stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends on mccormick’s nonvoting common stock with 1 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s 500 stock price index assuming reinvestment of dividends and 2 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s packaged foods  meats index assuming reinvestment of dividends 

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the accompanying financial statements 

foreign exchange risk – we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2019 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling euro polish zloty chinese yuan australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts which are designated as net investment hedges to manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling and euro gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in 2018 and 2017 we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries or unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2019 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2019 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2019 



we had a number of smaller contracts at november 30 2019 with an aggregate notional value of 218 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the romanian leu russian ruble and singapore dollar the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 02 million at november 30 2019 

at november 30 2018 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty swiss franc and other currencies with a notional value of 4949 million  the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 20 million at november 30 2018 

beginning in the first quarter of 2019 we also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are considered net investment hedges as of november 30 2019 we had notional values of cross currency interest rate swap contracts of i 250 million notional value to receive 250 million at threemonth us libor plus 0685 and pay £1941 million at threemonth gbp libor plus 0740 and ii £1941 million notional value to receive £1941 million at threemonth gbp libor plus 0740 and pay €2218 million at threemonth euro euribor plus 0808 these crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts expire in august 2027 for more information refer to footnote 7 

interest rate risk – our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2019 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

years of maturity at november 30 2019 



the table above displays the debt including capital leases by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects 



 commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2019 our most significant raw materials were dairy products vanilla pepper capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice and wheat flour  while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2019 

contractual cash obligations due by year 





 

pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2019 and 2018 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the accompanying financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer arrangements known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments such as trade discounts rebates or returns are estimated at the time of sale where applicable future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding these programs key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a oneyear or shorter duration estimates that affect revenue such as trade incentives and product returns are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2019 we had 45052 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 33776 million in the consumer segment and 11276 million in the flavor solutions segment our fiscal year 2019 testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we estimate fair values primarily through the use of the relieffromroyalty method and then compare those fair values to the related carrying 

amounts of the indefinitelived intangible asset in the event that the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks are less than their related carrying amounts a noncash impairment loss would recognized in an amount equal to the difference 

the estimation of fair values of our brand names and trademarks requires us to make significant assumptions including expectations with respect to sales and profits of the respective brands and trademarks related royalty rates and appropriate discount rates which are based in part upon current interest rates adjusted for our view of reasonable country and brand  specific risks based upon the past and anticipated future performance of the related brand names and trademarks  

as of november 30 2019 we had 26430 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date of the 26430 million of brand names assets and trademarks as of november 30 2019 i 23200 million relates to the french’s frank’s redhot and cattlemen’s brand names and trademarks recognized as part of our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 that we group for purposes of our impairment analysis and ii the remaining 3230 million represents a number of other brand name assets and trademarks with individual carrying values ranging from 02 million to 1064 million the percentage excess of estimated fair value over respective book values for each of our brand names and trademarks including the 23200 million related to our french’s franks redhot and cattlemen’s brands was 20 or more as of november 30 2019 except for one brand with a carrying value of 271 million whose fair value modestly exceeds its carrying value at that date 

the brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values a change in assumptions with respect to recently acquired businesses including those affected by rising interest rates or a deterioration in expectations of future sales profitability or royalty rates as well as future economic and market conditions or higher income tax rates could result in noncash impairment losses in the future 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates in addition interpretative guidance continues to be issued in connection with the us tax act enacted in december 2017 while we have considered available guidance there is no assurance that future guidance may not cause us to revise amounts currently recorded 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2020 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 1 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2020 pension expense by approximately 9 million 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in addition see note 10 of the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements

in august 2017 we completed the acquisition of reckitt benckisers food division rb foods from reckitt benckiser group plc the purchase price was approximately 421 billion net of acquired cash of 243 million the acquired marketleading brands of rb foods include french’s ®  frank’s redhot ®  and cattlemen’s ®  which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio we believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive us condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments at the time of the acquisition annual sales of rb foods were approximately 570 million the results of rb foods’ operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition 

business segments

consistent with market conditions in each segment our consumer segment has a higher overall profit margin than our flavor solutions segment in 2018 the consumer segment contributed approximately 61 of sales and 69 of operating income and the flavor solutions segment contributed approximately 39 of sales and 31 of operating income 

for a discussion of our recent acquisition activity please refer to “management’s discussion and analysis–acquisitions” and note 2 of the accompanying financial statements 

consumer segment   from locations around the world our brands reach consumers in approximately 150 countries and territories our leading brands in the americas include mccormick ®  french’s ®  frank’s redhot ®  lawry’s ®  and club house ®  as well as brands such as gourmet garden ® and old bay ®  we also market authentic regional and ethnic brands such as zatarain’s ®  stubbs ®  thai kitchen ®   and simply asia ®  in the europe middle east and africa emea region our major brands include the ducros ®  schwartz ®  kamis ®  and drogheria  alimentari ®  brands of spices herbs and seasonings and an extensive line of vahiné ®  brand dessert items in china we market our products under the mccormick and daqiao ®  brands in australia we market our spices and seasonings under the mccormick brand our dessert products under the aeroplane ®  brand and packaged chilled herbs under the gourmet garden brand in india we market our spices and rice products under the kohinoor ®  brand elsewhere in the asiapacific region we market our products under the mccormick brand as well as other brands 

our customers span a variety of retailers that include grocery mass merchandise warehouse clubs discount and drug stores and ecommerce retailers served directly and indirectly through distributors or wholesalers in addition to marketing our branded products to these customers we are also a leading supplier of private label items also known as store brands 

approximately half of our consumer segment sales are spices herbs and seasonings for these products we are a category leader in our primary markets there are numerous competitive brands of spices herbs and seasonings in the us and additional brands in international markets some are owned by large food manufacturers while others are supplied by small privatelyowned companies in this competitive environment we are leading with innovation 

and brand marketing and applying our analytical tools to help customers optimize the profitability of their spice and seasoning sales while simultaneously working to increase our sales and profit 

flavor solutions segment   in our flavor solutions segment we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers the foodservice customers are supplied with branded packaged products both directly and indirectly through distributors we supply food manufacturers and foodservice customers with customized flavor solutions and many of these customer relationships have been active for decades our range of flavor solutions remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends spices and herbs condiments coating systems and compound flavors in addition to a broad range of flavor solutions our longstanding customer relationships are evidence of our effectiveness in building customer intimacy our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas including sensory testing culinary research food safety and flavor application 

our flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach other competitors include larger publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature but which also tend to specialize in a narrower range of flavor solutions than mccormick 

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products pepper vanilla garlic capsicums red peppers and paprika onion rice and wheat flour pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced locally either within the united states or from our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program 

customers 

our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers wholesalers and distributors in the consumer segment products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels including grocery mass merchandise warehouse clubs discount and drug stores and ecommerce in the flavor solutions segment products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods customers for the flavor solutions segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors

the dollar amount of backlog orders for our business is not material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government 

trademarks licenses and patents 

we own a number of trademark registrations although in the aggregate these trademarks are material to our business the loss of any one of those trademarks with the exception of our “mccormick” “french’s ” “frank’s redhot” “lawry’s” “zatarain’s” “stubbs” “club house” “ducros” “schwartz” “vahiné” old bay simply asia thai kitchen kitchen basics “kamis” “drogheria  alimentari” daqiao “kohinoor” and gourmet garden trademarks would not have a material adverse effect on our business the “mc – mccormick” trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the us and certain nonus markets the terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful 

we have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and nonaffiliated entities the loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

the term of the license agreements is generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties 

we also own various patents none of which are individually material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis” 

competition 

each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive in this competitive environment our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights additionally in the consumer segment we are building brand recognition and loyalty through advertising and promotions 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world that apply to our global businesses in the united states the safety production transportation distribution advertising labeling and sale of many of our products and their ingredients are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the federal trade commission act state consumer protection laws competition laws anticorruption laws customs and trade laws federal state and local workplace health and safety laws various federal state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal state and local statutes and regulations outside the united states our business is subject to numerous similar statutes laws and regulatory requirements 

environmental regulations 

the cost of compliance with federal state and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2018 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2019 

employees 

we had approximately 11600 fulltime employees worldwide as of november 30 2018  our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages and in the opinion of management employee relations are good we have approximately 300 employees covered by a collective bargaining contract in the united states at our foreign subsidiaries approximately 2500 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements 

foreign operations 

we are subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business such as local economic and market conditions exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on investments royalties and dividends in fiscal year 2018 approximately 40 of sales were from nonus operations for information on how we manage some of these risks see the “market risk sensitivity” section of “management’s discussion and analysis”

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves risks including the risks described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to governmentimposed actions we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing such as the emergence of new sales channels like ecommerce and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business our flavor solutions segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our flavor solutions segment declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted 

approximately 21 of our consolidated sales in 2018  the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper vanilla garlic capsicums red peppers and paprika onion rice and wheat flour while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our cci program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacturing storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment consumer protection competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification customs and trade laws including the import and export of products and product ingredients employment and health and safety enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere in addition the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which came into effect in may 2018 creates a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of european union residents and increases financial penalties for noncompliance as a company that processes personal data of european union residents we bear the costs of compliance with the gdpr and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a 

breach of the gdpr these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

rb foods may underperform relative to our expectations 

we may not be able to maintain the growth rate levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and rb foods have achieved prior to the completion of that acquisition or might have achieved separately the business and financial performance of rb foods are subject to certain risks and uncertainties the underperformance of rb foods relative to our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits that we envisioned at the time of our acquisition of rb foods or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of rb foods will depend on many factors including but not limited to the following 

 the full anticipated benefits of its acquisition may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all each of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of shares of our common stock as a result it cannot be assured that the acquisition of rb foods will result in the realization of the full anticipated benefits 

our foreign and crossborder operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2018 approximately 40 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties several countries within the european union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union and the united kingdom uk additionally international sales together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the us are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may negatively impact our operations 

the uk is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the european union “brexit” scheduled for march 29 2019 in november 2018 the uk and the european union agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement that sets out the terms of the uk’s departure including commitments on citizen rights after brexit a financial settlement from the uk and a transition period from march 29 2019 through december 31 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed on january 15 2019 the draft withdrawal agreement was rejected by the uk parliament creating significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the uk will leave the european union 

if the uk leaves the european union with no agreement “hard brexit” it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further shortterm uncertainty and currency volatility in the absence of a future trade deal the uk’s trade with the european union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the world trade organization additionally the movement of goods between the uk and the remaining member states of the european union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure these changes to the trading relationship between the uk and european union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the uk and may decrease the profitability of our uk and other operations additional currency volatility could drive a weaker british pound which increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations a weaker british pound versus the us dollar also causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars during a reporting period with a range of outcomes still possible the impact from brexit remains uncertain and will depend in part on the final outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations 

increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 560 million at a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 29 on november 30 2018 we also had total outstanding variable rate longterm debt including current maturities of approximately 1284 million at a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 33 on november 30 2018 certain of our variable rate debt including our revolving credit facility currently uses libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments with respect to libor cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt the interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on our credit ratings our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital 

our credit ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions if our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

we have incurred additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of rb foods and may not be able to meet our debt service requirements 

after financing our acquisition of rb foods we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as of november 30 2018 the indebtedness of mccormick and its subsidiaries is approximately 47 billion this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 

 the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital 

markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyberattack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business we rely on our information technology systems some of which are or may be managed or hosted by or outsourced to third party service providers to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect appropriate information technology systems and infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades or oversee third party service providers our business or financial results could be negatively impacted the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction or reporting errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other security incidents service disruptions or other system or process failures such incidents could result in unauthorized access to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data as well as disruptions to operations we have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents although to date none has been material to address the risks to our information technology systems and data we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology developing security policies and procedures implementing and assessing the effectiveness of controls conducting risk assessments of third party service providers and designing business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve if we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident it may have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and we may experience other adverse consequences such as loss of assets remediation costs litigation regulatory investigations and the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event additionally we rely on services provided by thirdparty vendors for certain information technology processes and functions which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls 

the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another 

eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions and exit certain businesses or lines of business these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

the acquisition of rb foods has significantly increased our goodwill and other intangible assets 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects the impairment of any goodwill and other intangible assets may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 

curtailment of our share repurchase program may not enhance shareholder value 

we have curtailed the repurchases of our shares under our share repurchase program upon the acquisition of rb foods we announced our intention to reduce our leverage ratio by curtailing our share repurchase program but there can be no assurance that curtailment of the program will result in the reduction of our leverage ratio our board of directors reserves the right to expand or terminate the share repurchase program at any time curtailment of the share repurchase program may not have the intended effects and may have a negative impact on our stock price 

the declaration payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors 

the declaration payment and amount of any dividends is made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant including our financial position results of operations available cash resources cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders our dividend payments are subject to solvency conditions established by the maryland general corporation law accordingly there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our board of directors will not decide to reduce suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and flavor solutions as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 and increase adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 

sales growth  over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support customer intimacy expanded distribution and category growth 2 new products and 3 acquisitions 

base business –in 2018 we increased our investment in brand marketing by 18 as compared to 2017 we measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support through digital marketing we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes provide cooking advice and discover new products 

new products –for our consumer segment we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition including private label we are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion from gourmet premium items to convenient and valuepriced flavors 

for flavor solutions customers we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products as well as flavors for new menu items we have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans many of which include “betterforyou” innovation with over 20 product innovation centers around the world we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers 

acquisitions –acquisitions are expected to approximate onethird of our sales growth over time since the beginning of 2015 we have completed seven acquisitions which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments we focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health geographically our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets our acquisitions have included bolton opportunities and the august 17 2017 acquisition of reckitt benckisers food division rb foods from reckitt benckiser group plc for approximately 42 billion net of acquired cash the acquired marketleading brands of rb foods include french’s® frank’s redhot® and cattlemen’s® which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio we believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive us condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments 

the rb foods acquisition resulted in acquisitions contributing more than onethird of our sales growth in 2018 and 2017 

cost savings  we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

cash flow  we continue to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 8212 million in 2018 an increase from 8153 million in 2017 in 2018 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 33 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases in 2018 the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase was 3357 million due to our increased level of indebtedness because of the rb foods acquisition we have curtailed our acquisition and share repurchase activity for a period in order to enable a return to our preacquisition credit profile although we have curtailed our share repurchase activity we repurchased shares in 2018 to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and expect to continue this practice in 2019 

on a longterm basis we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2018 we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 119 over the 2017 level due to the following factors 

 

operating income was 9033 million in 2018 and 7024 million in 2017 we recorded 163 million and 222 million of special charges in 2018 and 2017 respectively related to organization and streamlining actions in 2018 and 2017 we also recorded 225 million and 617 million of transaction and integration expenses respectively related to our acquisition of rb foods that reduced operating income in 2018 compared to the yearago period the favorable impact of higher sales including the effects of the rb foods acquisition and 1179 million of cost savings from our cci program including organization and streamlining actions more than offset higher special charges transaction and integration expenses material costs and a 485 million increase in brand marketing excluding special charges together with transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of rb foods adjusted operating income was 9421 million an increase of 198 compared to 7863 million in the yearago period in constant currency adjusted operating income rose 191 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see nongaap financial measures 

diluted earnings per share was 700 in 2018 and 372 in 2017 the yearonyear increase in earnings per share was driven mainly by a lower effective tax rate coupled with benefits of the us tax act along with higher operating income as described above which was offset by higher interest expense and higher shares outstanding special charges lowered earnings per share by 010 and 012 in 2018 and 2017 respectively transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by 013 and 042 in 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2018 a nonrecurring benefit from the us tax act increased diluted earnings per share by 226 excluding the effects of special charges transaction and integration expenses and the nonrecurring benefit of the us tax act adjusted diluted earnings per share was 497 in 2018 and 426 in 2017 or an increase of 167 

2019 outlook 

in connection with our pending adoption of two new accounting standards relating to revenue recognition and income statement classification of pension expense we will at the beginning of fiscal 2019 recast our historical income statements for 2018 2017 and 2016 to retrospectively reflect the adoption of those standards as more fully described in note 2 of the accompanying financial statements while there will be no impact to net income or basic or diluted earnings per share in those years or in interim periods within those years we currently estimate that the adoption of those new accounting standards will result in the following aggregate income statement reclassifications to our historical results i a reduction in annual sales by approximately 100 million to 110 million for each of the years ended november 30 2018 2017 and 2016 ii an increase in cost of goods sold by 1764 million 1124 million and 900 million for the years ended november 30 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively iii a decrease in 

selling general and administrative expense by an amount ranging from 2642 million to 2742 million for the year ended november 30 2018 from 2098 million to 2198 million for the year ended november 30 2017 and from 1984 million to 2084 million for the year ended november 30 2016 iv an increase decrease in operating income by 122 million 26 million and 84 million for the years ended november 30 2018 2017 and 2016 and v an increase decrease in nonoperating income net or the line captioned other income expense net in our consolidated income statements by 122 million 26 million and 84 million for the years ended november 30 2018 2017 and 2016 the adoption of these standards and related estimated reclassifications which will be reflected retrospectively are not anticipated to have a material impact on the growth rates for sales adjusted operating income or adjusted earnings per share or other expectations provided with respect to our 2019 outlook included in the following paragraphs 

we project another year of strong financial performance in 2019 in 2019 we expect to grow sales 1 to 3 including an estimated 2 unfavorable impact from currency rates or 3 to 5 on a constant currency basis that anticipated 2019 sales growth is primarily driven by higher volume and product mix with some impact of pricing to offset anticipated cost increases and consists entirely of organic growth as we do not anticipate an incremental sales impact from acquisitions in 2019 we expect our 2019 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75 basis points higher in 2019 than in 2018 in part driven by our cciled cost savings 

 in 2019 we expect an increase in operating income of 10 to 12 which includes an estimated 2 unfavorable impact from currency rates that increase in operating income reflects the impact of lower special charges estimated at 15 million in 2019 compared to 163 million in 2018 and the absence of 225 million of transaction and integration expenses incurred in 2018 excluding special charges and in 2018 transaction and integration expenses we expect 2019’s adjusted operating income to increase 7 to 9 which includes an estimated 2 unfavorable impact from currency rates or 9 to 11 on a constant currency basis our cciled cost savings target in 2019 is approximately 110 million in 2019 we expect to support our sales growth with a brand marketing investment comparable with the 2018 level after consideration of the impact on both years of the adoption of the new accounting standards previously described 

our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2019 than in 2018 as the us tax act was not fully effective for us as a noncalendar year end company in 2018 absent the impact of discrete tax items we estimate our underlying tax rate to be approximately 24 in 2019 including the impact of a discrete tax item that occurred in december 2018 we estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate 22 in fiscal 2019 in 2018 we recognized a net nonrecurring tax benefit of 3015 million upon the enactment of the us tax act excluding that benefit and taxes associated with special charges and transaction and integration expenses our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 196 in 2018 we expect our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 to approximate our effective tax rate under us gaap of 22 

diluted earnings per share was 700 in 2018 diluted earnings per share for 2019 are projected to range from 509 to 519 excluding the per share impact of the nonrecurring benefit from the us tax act of 226 special charges of 010 and transaction and integration expenses of 013 in 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 497 in 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding an estimated 008 per share impact from special charges are projected to be 517 to 527 in 2019 we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2019 to grow 4 to 6 which includes a 2 unfavorable impact from currency rates or to grow 6 to 8 in constant currency over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 497 in 2018 we expect this growth rate to be mainly driven by increased adjusted operating income which we expect to be partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate in 2019 

results of operations—2018 compared to 2017 



sales for 2018 increased by 119 from 2017 and by 107 on a constant currency basis that is excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption nongaap financial measures both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 22 to sales this was driven by new products as well as growth in the base business the incremental impact of pricing actions added 05 to sales as compared to 2017 the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition added 80 to sales during 2018 a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 12 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 107 on a constant currency basis 



in 2018 our gross profit margin rose 220 basis points to 438 from 416 in 2017 while this expansion in 2018 includes the accretive impact from our acquisition of the rb foods business together with the absence of related transaction and integration expenses of 209 million that depressed our 2017 gross profit margin by 40 basis points our core business was also a driver of that expansion in 2018 cciled cost savings and the shift in our core product portfolio to more valueadded products continued to drive profit expansion across both of our segments excluding the effect of those transaction and integration expenses in 2017 adjusted gross profit margin rose 180 basis points from 420 in 2017 to 438 in 2018 



selling general and administrative sga expense was 14295 million in 2018 compared to 12448 million in 2017 an increase of 1847 million that increase in sga expense was driven by the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition together with increased brand marketing and higher distribution costs including freight which was offset in part by cciled cost savings including the benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements as a result sga expense as a percentage of net sales was 264 a 60basis point increase from 2017 



we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizational structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our management committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements special charges of 163 million were recorded in 2018 and 222 million in 2017 to enable us to implement these changes 

during 2018 we recorded 163 million of special charges consisting primarily of i 115 million related to our multiyear ge initiative consisting of 75 million of third party expenses 10 million of employee severance charges and a noncash asset impairment charge of 30 million that noncash asset impairment charge was related to the writeoff of certain software assets that are incompatible with our future move approved in the second quarter of 2018 to a new global enterprise resource planning platform to facilitate planned actions under our ge initiative to align and simplify our endtoend processes to support our future growth ii a onetime payment in the aggregate amount of 22 million made to eligible us hourly employees to distribute a portion of the nonrecurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the us tax act iii 10 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs directly associated with the relocation of one of our chinese manufacturing facilities and iv 16 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations in our asiapacific region to a newly constructed facility in thailand 

during 2017 we recorded 222 million of special charges consisting primarily of 127 million related to third party expenses incurred as part of our evaluation of changes relating to our ge initiative 28 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with the relocation of one of our chinese manufacturing facilities 25 million for severance and other exit costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in portugal and 17 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with actions related to the 

transfer of certain manufacturing operations to a new facility under construction in thailand see note 3 of the accompanying financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges 



transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition totaled 225 million and 771 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2018 these costs primarily consisted of outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition in 2017 these expenses consisted of amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value adjustment of inventories of 209 million that was included in cost of goods sold outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition including the costs related to the bridge financing commitment of 154 million that was included in other debt costs 



interest expense for 2018 of 1746 million was sharply higher than the prior year level primarily due to higher average borrowings in 2018 related to our incurrence of 37 billion in debt in august 2017 to finance the acquisition of rb foods see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements other income net for 2018 of 126 million was significantly higher than the 2017 level principally due to a gain of 63 million recognized on the sale in 2018 of a building vacated as part of our move to a new global headquarters in maryland higher interest income and lower nonoperating foreign currency transaction losses recognized in 2018 as compared to 2017 also contributed to this increase 



the provision for income taxes is based on the thencurrent estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period we record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of us gaap examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income of the current fiscal year include but are not limited to excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations provisiontoreturn adjustments and the settlement of tax audits 

as more fully described in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements the us tax act was enacted in december 2017 the us tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 beginning on january 1 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries under gaap specifically asc topic 740 income taxes  the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted we recorded a net benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act during 2018 this amount includes a 3800 million benefit from the revaluation of our net us deferred tax liabilities as of january 1 2018 based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset in part by an estimated net transition tax impact of 785 million that net transition tax impact is comprised of the mandated onetime transition tax on previously deferred post1986 foreign earnings of us subsidiaries estimated at 753 million together with additional foreign withholding taxes of 79 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the us tax act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018 less a 47 million reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes directly resulting from the transition tax 

the effective tax rate was a benefit of 212 in 2018 as compared to an effective tax rate expense of 254 in 2017 the effective tax rate benefit of 212 in 2018 includes the net tax benefit of 3015 million associated with the us tax act as more fully described above that had a 407 impact on 2018’s effective tax rate our 2018 effective tax rate also reflects the effects of the lower us federal corporate income tax rate under the us tax act and higher other net discrete tax benefits net discrete tax benefits excluding the effects of the us tax act in 2018 increased by 39 million from 242 million in 2017 to 281 million in 2018 discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees 217 million and 107 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions and other discrete items including in 2017 the establishment of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred taxes see note 12 of the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations increased 09 million in 2018 from the prior year this increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings from our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico partially offset by the impact of a higher elimination of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2018 than in 2017 we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including mccormick de mexico which represented 58 of the sales and 76 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2018 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 700 in 2018 compared to 372 in 2017 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2017 to 2018 the increase in operating income in the table below includes the impact from favorable currency exchange rates in 2018 



we measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition see note 15 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment of operating income excluding special charges as well as transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition to consolidated operating income in the following discussion we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as segment operating income 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment grew by 117 as compared to 2017 and grew by 103 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 17 to sales while the impact of 2018 pricing actions added 06 the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition added 80 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased consumer segment sales by 14 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 103 on a constant currency basis

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 102 as compared to 2017 and increased 77 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 64 to sales growth was led by china through product innovation and increased distribution partially offset by lower private label sales in australia pricing actions added 13 to sales the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 25 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 77 on a constant currency basis 

we grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by 807 million or 143 in 2018 compared to 2017 the favorable impact of greater sales and higher cciled cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher costs and brand marketing expense on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 134 segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 40 basis points to 194 in 2018 from 190 in 2017 the increase in segment operating income margin was driven by a higher gross profit margin and the leverage of fixed and semifixed elements of sga over the higher sales base in 2018 as compared to 2017 those factors were partially offset by an increase in sga as a percentage of sales driven by increased investment in brand marketing and higher distribution costs including freight the previously described gross profit margin improvement includes the incremental accretive impact attributable to the rb foods acquisition as well as expansion in our core business in part from cciled cost savings and favorable product mix 

flavor solutions segment 



sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 122 as compared to 2017 and increased by 114 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 31 to sales and pricing actions added 03 flavor solutions segment sales rose in 2018 due to the incremental impact of acquisitions primarily the rb foods acquisition which added 80 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased flavor solutions segment sales by 08 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 114 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas flavor solutions sales rose 148 in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose 147 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 30 to sales led by increased sales to several large custom flavor solutions customers partially offset by the impact from a global realignment of a major customers sales to emea together with the exit of certain lower margin business pricing actions added 03 to sales and the incremental impact of our rb foods acquisition added 114 to sales the favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 01 compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 147 on a constant currency basis

we grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by 751 million or 338 in 2018 compared to 2017 the increase in segment operating income was due to the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition coupled with cciled cost savings on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment rose 338 segment operating income margin for our flavor solutions segment rose by 230 basis points to 142 in 2018 from 119 in 2017 and was driven by a higher gross profit margin offset in part by higher sga as a percentage of net sales which reflects higher distribution costs including freight 

results of operations—2017 compared to 2016 



sales for 2017 increased by 96 from 2016 and by 103 on a constant currency basis both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 17 to sales this was driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 21 to sales the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2017 both rb foods and giotti and in 2016 principally gourmet garden added 65 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 07 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 103 on a constant currency basis 



in 2017 our gross profit margin rose 10 basis points to 416 from 415 in 2016 as the favorable impact of pricing actions cciled cost savings and more favorable business mix more than offset unfavorable material cost inflation including unfavorable foreign currency effects in addition our gross profit for 2017 was burdened by 209 million of transaction and integration expenses representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of rb foods that depressed our fiscal 2017 gross profit margin of 416 by 40 basis points excluding those transaction and integration expenses adjusted gross profit margin rose 50 basis points from 415 in 2016 to 420 in 2017 



selling general and administrative expense was 12448 million in 2017 compared to 11750 million in 2016 an increase of 698 million that increase in sga expense was driven by the impact of acquisitions together with increased brand marketing and higher freight costs partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs related to both completed and uncompleted acquisitions all as compared to the 2016 levels the lower acquisitionrelated costs in the 2017 period were primarily the result of costs associated with our investigation in 2016 of a large potential acquisition in the uk that we ultimately declined to pursue in addition acquisitionrelated costs attributable to rb foods in 2017 are not included in sga expense but are instead included in transaction and integration expenses in our income statement and are further discussed below sga expense as a percentage of net sales was 258 an 80basis point improvement from 2016 driving this reduction in sga expense as a percentage of net sales in addition to the items described above were lower employee benefit expense including lower pension and other postretirement benefit expense together with benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements

interest expense for 2017 was sharply higher than the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings related to our incurrence of 37 billion in debt in august 2017 to finance our acquisition of rb foods see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements other income net for 2017 was 07 million lower than the 2016 level primarily due to a gain on the 2016 sale of a nonoperating asset 



the effective tax rate decreased 60 basis points to 254 in 2017 from 260 in 2016 primarily because of an increase in net discrete tax benefits net discrete tax benefits increased by 31 million from 211 million in 2016 to 242 million in 2017 in 2017 discrete items include 107 million of excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees due to our adoption of asu no 201609 stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting on a prospective basis as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year both 2017 and 2016 included discrete tax benefits for the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided for the expiration of statutes of limitation and in 2017 settlements with taxing authorities in several tax jurisdictions discrete tax expense in 2017 included expense associated with the establishment of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets discrete tax items in 2016 included benefits associated with the reversal of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 22 million in 2017 from the prior year this decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of eliminating earnings associated with our minority interests in 2017 as compared to a loss in 2016 and to lower earnings from our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico for which the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates more than offset the favorable impact in local currency of higher sales and net income we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including mccormick de mexico which represented 57 of the sales and 74 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2017 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 372 in 2017 compared to 369 in 2016 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2016 to 2017 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2017

nongaap financial measures 

the following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit adjusted gross profit margin adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted income from unconsolidated operations adjusted income tax expense adjusted income tax rate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share these financial measures also exclude for 2018 the net nonrecurring income tax benefit of 3015 million related to the us tax act as these items significantly impact comparability between years these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states 

generally accepted accounting principles these financial measures exclude the impact as applicable of the following 

 details with respect to the composition of special charges transaction and integration expenses including other debt costs and income taxes associated with the us tax act recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2 3 and 12 respectively of the accompanying financial statements 

we believe that these nongaap financial measures are important the exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

these nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting 

a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below in millions except per share data 







because we are a multinational company we are subject to variability of our reported us dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis” is a nongaap measure we believe that this nongaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the us it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows 1 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2018 on a constant currency basis net sales and adjusted operating income for 2018 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2017 and compared to the reported results for 2017 and 2 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2017 on a constant currency basis net sales and operating income for 2017 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2016 and compared to the reported results for 2016 

  





to present the percentage change in projected 2019 sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis 2019 projected local currency sales adjusted operating income and adjusted net income for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at currently prevailing exchange rates and are compared to those 2019 local currency projected results translated into us dollars at the average actual exchange rates in effect during the corresponding months in fiscal year 2018 to determine what the 2019 consolidated us dollar sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share would have been if the relevant currency exchange rates had not changed from those of the comparable prioryear periods 







in addition to the above nongaap financial measures we use a leverage ratio which is determined using nongaap measures a leverage ratio is a widelyused measure of ability to repay outstanding debt obligations and is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating financial leverage we believe that our leverage ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate such a leverage ratio we determine our leverage ratio as net debt which we define as total debt net of cash in excess of 750 million to adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses for interest income taxes depreciation and amortization less interest income and as further adjusted for cash and noncash acquisitionrelated transaction and integration expenses which may include the effect of the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory on cost of goods sold special charges and stockbased compensation expenses adjusted ebitda and our leverage ratio are both nongaap financial measures our determination of the leverage ratio is consistent with the terms of our 10 billion revolving credit facility and our term loans which require us to maintain our leverage ratio below certain levels under those agreements the applicable leverage ratio is reduced annually as of november 30 2018 our capacity under the revolving credit facility is not affected by these covenants we do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future however the leverage ratio could restrict our ability to utilize this facility we expect to comply with this financial covenant for the foreseeable future 

the following table reconciles our net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended november 30 2018 2017 and 2016 



  



our longterm target for our leverage ratio is 15 to 18 our leverage ratio can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity

we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives service our debt increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business we generate much of our cash flow in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2018 the exchange rates for the euro the british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty and chinese renminbi were lower versus the us dollar than at november 30 2017 

operating cash flow –  operating cash flow was 8212 million in 2018 8153 million in 2017 and 6581 million in 2016 the increase in cash flow from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher net income exclusive of the noncash nonrecurring net income tax benefit of 3094 million related to the us tax act as more fully described below our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow in both 2018 and 2017 in 2018 those increases were partially offset by a higher use of cash from other operating assets and liabilities partially related to the timing of our payment of transaction and integration expenses as well as of interest on indebtedness related to our acquisition of rb foods as compared to the source of cash in 2017 the improvement in cash flow from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to improvements in cash flow generated from inventories and accounts payable and the favorable timing of our payment of transaction and integration expenses as well as of interest on indebtedness related to our acquisition of rb foods which was partially offset by the timing of employee benefit payments 

our working capital management –  principally related to inventory trade accounts receivable and accounts payable –  impacts our operating cash flow the change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations it was a use of cash in 2018 a significant source of cash in 2017 and a significant use of cash in 2016 the change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years as it was a source of cash in 2018 and a use of cash in 2017 and 2016 the change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in all three years but more so in 2017 compared to 2018 and 2016 dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates which were higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 and lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 also impacted our cash flow from operations 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash 

outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decreases in ccc in 2018 from 2017 and in 2017 from 2016 were due in both instances to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers and to a lesser extent a decrease in our days in inventory 

investing cash flow –  net cash used in investing activities was 1585 million in 2018 45083 million in 2017 and 2671 million in 2016 the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses which amounted to 42 million in 2018 43274 million in 2017 and 1206 million in 2016 see note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further details related to these acquisitions capital expenditures were 1691 million in 2018 1824 million in 2017 and 1538 million in 2016 we expect 2019 capital expenditures to approximate 210 million to support our planned growth and other initiatives 

financing cash flow –  net cash used in financing activities was 7511 million in 2018 as compared to cash provided of 37560 million in 2017 and cash used of 3715 million in 2016 the variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings share repurchase activity and dividends all as described below 

in 2018 our net borrowing activity used cash of 4665 million in 2017 and 2016 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 35746 million and 557 million respectively 

in 2018 we increased our shortterm borrowings on a net basis by 3055 million and borrowed 259 million under longterm borrowing arrangements in 2018 we repaid 7979 million of longterm debt including the 250 million 575 notes that matured on december 15 2017 and 5450 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 

in 2017 we received 39776 million of net proceeds on the issuance of 40000 million of longterm debt including 25000 million of notes and 15000 million of term loans see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information with respect to this longterm debt we also paid 77 million of costs associated with the issuance of debt and our 10 billion revolving credit facility in 2017 we repaid 2727 million of longterm debt including 2688 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 in 2017 we repaid 1346 million of shortterm borrowings 

in 2016 net proceeds from shortterm borrowings of 2517 million were used to pay off 200 million of 520 notes that matured in december 2015 and for general corporate purposes 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 



as of november 30 2018 127 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in march 2015 the timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors due to our increased level of indebtedness related to our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 we have curtailed our acquisition and share repurchase activity for a period in order to enable a return to our preacquisition credit profile although we have curtailed our share repurchase activity we repurchased shares in 2018 to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and expect to continue this practice in 2019 

during 2017 we issued approximately 635 million shares of our common stock nonvoting to fund our acquisition of rb foods see notes 2 and 13 of the accompanying financial statements which included approximately 08 million shares from the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the net proceeds from this issuance after the underwriting discount and related expenses was 5540 million in addition we also issued 295 million of common stock related to our stock compensation plans in 2017 all of the common stock issued in 2018 and 2016 related to our stock compensation plans including the effects of the related excess tax benefits 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2018 the board of directors approved a 96 increase in the quarterly dividend from 052 to 057 per share 

the following table presents our leverage ratios for the trailing twelvemonth periods ended november 30 2018 2017 and 2016 



1 the leverage ratio covenant in our 10 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements both outstanding at november 30 2018 and 2017 provide that adjusted ebitda under that covenant also include the pro forma impact of acquisitions as applicable as of november 30 2017 our leverage ratio under the terms of those agreements including the pro forma impact of acquisitions was 45 

our leverage ratio was 40 as of november 30 2018 as compared to the ratios of 51 and 17 as of november 30 2017 and 2016 respectively the decrease in the ratio from 51 as of november 30 2017 to 40 as of november 30 2018 is principally due to an increase in our adjusted ebitda which was driven by the previously described improvement in operating income as compared to 2017 in addition the ratio was favorably impacted by our lower level of net debt at november 30 2018 

the increase in the ratio from 17 as of november 30 2016 to 51 as of november 30 2017 is principally due to an increase in total debt associated with the funding net of cash flow from operations for 2017 of our acquisitions of rb foods and giotti repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed prior to the enactment of the us tax act on december 22 2017 the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions currently the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could still have adverse tax consequences related to the effects of withholding and other taxes at november 30 2018 we temporarily used 1812 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2018 and 2017 were 7000 million and 6306 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2018 and 2017 was 50816 million and 29966 million respectively 

see notes 6 and 7 of the accompanying financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets  – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities  – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in august 2017 we entered into a fiveyear 10 billion revolving credit facility which will expire in august 2022 the current pricing for the credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 125 the pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to libor plus 175 this facility replaces our prior facilities i a fiveyear 750 million revolving credit facility that was due to expire in june 2020 and ii a 364day 250 million revolving facility which we entered into in the second quarter of 2017 and that was due to expire in march 2018 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 2373 million as of november 30 2018 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders discretion we engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash contributions to pension plans including unfunded plans were 135 million in 2018 187 million in 2017 and 251 million in 2016 it is expected that the 2019 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 120 million future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 61 of assets are invested in equities 29 in fixed income investments and 10 in other investments assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60 in equities and 40 in fixed income investments see note 10 of the accompanying financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits 

in fiscal 2018 we purchased the remaining 10 minority ownership interest in our shanghai subsidiary for a cash payment of 127 million 

in fiscal 2017 we made the following acquisitions 



operations of rb foods have been included as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition 

in fiscal 2016 we made the following acquisitions 

 

see note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions

the following line graph compares the yearly change in mccormick’s cumulative total shareholder return stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends on mccormick’s nonvoting common stock with 1 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s 500 stock price index assuming reinvestment of dividends and 2 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s packaged foods  meats index assuming reinvestment of dividends 

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the accompanying financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2018 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling euro polish zloty chinese yuan canadian dollar and mexican peso we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates during 2018 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2018 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2018 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2018 



we had a number of smaller contracts at november 30 2018 with an aggregate notional value of 160 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc the romanian leu and russian ruble the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 02 million at november 30 2018 

at november 30 2017 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty swiss franc and others with a notional value of 4059 million all of which matured in 2018 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 80 million at november 30 2017 

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2018 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

years of maturity at november 30 2018 



the table above displays the debt including capital leases by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects 

 commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2018 our most significant raw materials were dairy products pepper vanilla garlic capsicums red peppers and paprika onion rice and wheat flour while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2018 

contractual cash obligations due by year 





 

pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2018 and 2017 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the accompanying financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2018 we had 45279 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 33989 million in the consumer segment and 11290 million in the flavor solutions segment   our fiscal year 2018 testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we estimate fair value by using a relieffromroyalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

as of november 30 2018 we had 26469 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date excluding the brand names associated with the 2017 rb foods acquisition and those brand names discussed below the percentage excess of estimated fair value over book values for our major brand names and trademarks was 25 or more as of november 30 2018 

the following table outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2018 



the percentage excess of estimated fair value over book value for the kamis and stubbs brand names as of november 30 2018 was approximately 19 and 11 respectively a change in assumptions with respect to future performance of either the kamis or stubbs businesses could result in impairment losses in the future 

the brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions in particular our most recent – and most significant – acquisition rb foods may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values a change in assumptions with respect to future performance of these recently acquired businesses or a change in other assumptions including those effected by rising interest rates could result in noncash impairment losses in the future 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately 

paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates in addition interpretative guidance continues to be issued in connection with the us tax act enacted in december 2017 while we have considered available guidance there is no assurance that future guidance may not cause us to revise amounts currently recorded 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2019 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 2 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2019 pension expense by approximately 9 million 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in addition see note 10 of the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are pepper dairy products garlic vanilla capsicums red peppers and paprika onion wheat flour and rice pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced from within the us and locally for many of our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program

we also own various patents none of which are individually material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis”

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or 

brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing such as the emergence of new sales channels like ecommerce and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business our industrial segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial segment declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 22 of our consolidated sales in 2017  the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper dairy products garlic vanilla capsicums red peppers and paprika onion wheat flour and rice while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our cci program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacturing storage labeling marketing 

advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification the import and export of products and product ingredients employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

our foreign and crossborder operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2017  41 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties several countries within the european union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union and the united kingdom uk additionally international sales together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the us are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may negatively impact our operations 

the june 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union “brexit” adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies as the uk negotiates its exit from the european union volatility in exchange rates and in uk interest rates may continue in the near term a weaker british pound compared to the us dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars a weaker british pound compared to other currencies increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations and a higher uk interest rate may have a dampening effect on the uk economy in the longer term any impact from brexit on our uk operations will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations 

increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 258 million at an average interest rate of approximately 23 on november 30 2017  we also had total outstanding variable rate longterm debt including current maturities of 1243 million at an average interest rate of approximately 27 on november 30 2017 the interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on our credit ratings our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital 

our credit ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions if our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained 

we have incurred additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of rb foods and may not be able to meet our debt service requirements 

after financing our acquisition of rb foods we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as of november 30 2017 the indebtedness of mccormick and its subsidiaries is approximately 50 billion this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including but not limited to 



 the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently we rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control including those involving cyber attacks using viruses worms or other destructive software process breakdowns or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing such breaches could result in unauthorized access 

to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data we invest in security technology and design our business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches while we believe that these measures are generally effective there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which has been material to us to date however a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation regulatory enforcement proceedings and direct costs associated with incident response 

the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or 

proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions and exit certain businesses or lines of business these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we have incurred significant transaction and integration expenses in connection with the acquisition of rb foods that could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have incurred significant transaction expenses in connection with the rb foods acquisition including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and related financing transactions we have also incurred significant integration expenses and expect to continue to incur such expenses in 2018 additional unanticipated expenses may be incurred in the integration process these could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid 

  

rb foods may underperform relative to our expectations 

we may not be able to maintain the growth rate levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that we and rb foods have achieved prior to the completion of that acquisition or might have achieved separately the business and financial performance of rb foods are subject to certain risks and uncertainties the underperformance of rb foods relative to our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits that we envisioned at the time of our acquisition of rb foods or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating rb foods 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of rb foods will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate rb foods into the rest of our business which is a complex costly and timeconsuming process the nature of a carveout acquisition such as rb foods makes it inherently more difficult to assume operations upon closing of the acquisition and to integrate activities as certain systems processes and employees may not all be transferred with rb foods to support such activities as a result we will be required to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practices and operations of mccormick and rb foods future integration efforts may disrupt our business and if implemented ineffectively could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits the failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the rb foods acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our operations and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition the further integration of rb foods may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customers and other business relationships and diversion of management’s attention additional integration challenges include 

 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation in addition even if rb foods is integrated successfully the full anticipated benefits of its acquisition may not be realized including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process each of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of shares of our common stock as a result it cannot be assured that the acquisition of rb foods will result in the realization of the full anticipated benefits 

we expect that for a period of time following our acquisition of rb foods on august 17 2017 we will have significantly less cash on hand than prior to that date 

we expect to have for a period of time following the august 17 2017 acquisition of rb foods significantly less cash and cash equivalents on hand than the cash and cash equivalents that we had on hand prior to that date although we believe that we will have access to cash sufficient to meet our business objectives and capital needs the lessened availability of cash and cash equivalents for a period of time following the acquisition of rb foods could constrain our ability to grow our business our more leveraged financial position following the acquisition of rb foods could also make us vulnerable to general economic downturns and industry conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have more cash at their disposal in the event that we do not have adequate capital to maintain or develop our business additional capital may not be available to us on a timely basis on favorable terms or at all 

  

the acquisition of rb foods has significantly increased our goodwill and other intangible assets 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects the impairment of any goodwill and other intangible assets may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 

curtailment of our share repurchase program may not enhance shareholder value 

we have curtailed the repurchases of our shares under our share repurchase program upon the acquisition of rb foods we announced our intention to reduce our leverage ratio by curtailing our share repurchase program but there can be no assurance that curtailment of the program will result in the reduction of our leverage ratio our board of directors reserves the right to expand or terminate the share repurchase program at any time curtailment of the share repurchase program may not have the intended effects and may have a negative impact on our stock price 

the declaration payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors 

the declaration payment and amount of any dividends is made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant including our financial position results of operations available cash resources cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders our dividend payments are subject to solvency conditions established by the maryland general corporation law accordingly there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our board of directors will not decide to reduce suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase adjusted operating income 7 to 9 and increase adjusted earnings per share 9 to 11 

sales growth  over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base businessdriven by brand marketing support customer intimacy expanded distribution and category growth 2 new products and 3 acquisitions 

base business –in 2017 we increased our investment in brand marketing by 39 over the 2012 level and we plan a further increase in 2018 we measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support through digital marketing we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes provide cooking advice and discover new products 

new products –for our consumer segment we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition including private label we are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion from gourmet premium items to convenient and valuepriced flavors 

for industrial customers we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products as well as flavors for new menu items we have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans many of which include “betterforyou” innovation with over 20 product innovation centers around the world we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our industrial customers with products that appeal to local consumers 

acquisitions –acquisitions are expected to approximate onethird of our sales growth since the beginning of 2015 we have completed seven acquisitions which are driving sales in both our consumer and industrial segments we focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health geographically our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets in addition to bolton opportunities we were seeking larger acquisitions 

on august 17 2017 we completed the acquisition of reckitt benckisers food division rb foods from reckitt benckiser group plc the purchase price was approximately 42 billion net of acquired cash the acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 635 million shares of common stock nonvoting see note 13 of the financial statements and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and prepayable term loans see note 6 of the financial statements the acquired marketleading brands of rb foods include french’s® frank’s redhot® and cattlemen’s® which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio we believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive us condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments 

the rb foods acquisition resulted in acquisitions contributing more than onethird of our sales growth in 2017 and is expected to result in acquisitions contributing more than onethird of our sales growth in 2018 

cost savings  we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

cash flow  we continue to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 8153 million in 2017 an increase from 6581 million in 2016 in 2017 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 32 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases in 2017 the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase was 3754 million due to our increased level of indebtedness because of the rb foods acquisition we expect to curtail our acquisition and share repurchase activity for a period of time in order to enable a return to our preacquisition credit profile 

on a longterm basis we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2017 we achieved further growth of our business although sales and earnings reported in us dollars were unfavorably impacted by the strength of the us dollar and the resultant unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange as compared to 2016 net sales rose 96 over the 2016 level because of the following factors 

 

operating income was 7024 million in 2017 and 6410 million in 2016 we recorded 222 million and 160 million of special charges in 2017 and 2016 respectively related to organization and streamlining actions in 2017 we also recorded 617 million of transaction and integration expenses relating to our acquisition of rb foods that reduced operating income in 2017 compared to the yearago period the favorable impact of higher sales including the effects of acquisitions and 1170 million of cost savings from our cci program and organization and streamlining actions more than offset higher special charges transaction and integration expenses material costs and a 241 million increase in brand marketing excluding special charges and in 2017 transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of rb foods adjusted operating income was 7863 million an increase of 197 compared to 6570 million in the yearago period in constant currency adjusted operating income rose 205 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see nongaap financial measures 

diluted earnings per share was 372 in 2017 and 369 in 2016 the yearonyear increase in earnings per share was driven mainly by higher operating income as described above which was nearly offset by higher interest expense and higher shares outstanding special charges lowered earnings per share by 012 and 009 in 2017 and 2016 respectively transaction and integration expenses including 154 million reflected as other debt costs lowered earnings per share by 042 in 2017 excluding the effect of those special charges and transaction and integration expenses adjusted diluted earnings per share was 426 in 2017 and 378 in 2016 or an increase of 127 

2018 outlook 

we project another year of strong financial performance in 2018 and including the results of rb foods from its acquisition date of august 17 2017 we expect our constant currency growth rate in sales operating income and adjusted earnings per share to exceed our longterm financial growth objectives 

in 2018 we expect to grow sales 12 to 14 including an estimated 1 favorable impact from currency rates or 11 to 13 on a constant currency basis the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition is projected to contribute approximately 8 of that sales growth we expect further increases in volume and product mix in our base business to drive the remaining sales growth anticipated in 2018 as with material cost inflation projected in the low single digits we do not expect significant pricing impact in 2018 other than the incremental impact of actions taken in 2017 

in 2018 we expect gross profit margin to be approximately 150 to 200 basis points higher than 2017 due to a projected low single digit increase in material costs that is more than offset by the effects of favorable business mix cciled cost savings and the lack of 209 million of transaction and integration expenses reflected in cost of goods sold in 2017 related to the rb foods acquisition 

led by cci we expect to reach cost savings of approximately 100 million in 2018 with a large portion impacting our cost of goods sold material cost inflation is expected to be in the midsingle digit range and we expect to offset most of this incremental impact with our 2017 pricing actions 

in 2018 we expect a significant increase in operating income in part due to the effects of the rb foods acquisition including the lower amount of transaction and integration expenses we expect 2018’s adjusted operating income to increase 23 to 25 which includes the incremental impact of the rb foods acquisition and a 1 favorable impact from currency rates for 2018 we plan to increase brand marketing at a rate above our sales growth 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law hr 1 “an act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles ii and v of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018” this legislation was formerly called the “tax cuts and jobs act” and is referred to herein as the “us tax act” the us tax act provides for significant changes in the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the us tax act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 certain provisions of the us tax act will be effective during our fiscal year ending november 30 2018 with all provisions of the us tax act effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year ending november 30 2019  

we expect that us tax act will have the following effects on our income tax expense for the fiscal year ending november 30 2018 



the repatriation tax and the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as described above and other discrete items will approximate 24 

 as previously noted the us tax act will fully affect us in fiscal year 2019 as certain other of its provisions related to the taxation of nonus activity on a current basis will impact our results particularly the “global intangible lowtaxed income” tax that imposes a tax on earnings that are not subject to tax by nonus jurisdictions above a certain minimum rate consequently we estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate excluding the effects of discrete tax items will approximate 25 to 26 in fiscal 2019 

the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” on december 23 2017 sab 118 provides a oneyear measurement period from a registrant’s reporting period that includes the us tax act’s enactment date to allow the registrant sufficient time to obtain prepare and analyze information to complete the accounting required under asc 740 

the ultimate impact of the us tax act on our reported results in fiscal 2018 and beyond may differ from the estimates provided herein possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made guidance that may be issued and other actions we may take as a result of the us tax act different from that presently contemplated 

diluted earnings per share was 372 in 2017 diluted earnings per share for 2018 are projected to range from 689 to 714 excluding the per share impact of special charges of 012 and transaction and integration expenses related to the rb foods acquisition including the effect of the amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value adjustments of inventories included in cost of goods sold the bridge commitment fee included in other debt costs and other transaction and integration expenses of 042 in 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 426 in 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding an estimated 233 to 248 per share nonrecurring benefit from us tax act changes an estimated 011 per share impact from special charges and an estimated 013 per share impact from integration expenses related to the rb foods acquisition are projected to be 480 to 490 in 2018 we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2018 to grow 13 to 15 which includes a 1 favorable impact from currency rates over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 426 in 2017 we expect this growth rate to be mainly driven by increased adjusted operating income and a lower effective tax rate which will more than offset the effects of higher interest expense and higher diluted shares 

results of operations—2017 compared to 2016 



sales for 2017 increased by 96 from 2016 and by 103 on a constant currency basis that is excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption nongaap financial measures both the consumer and industrial segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 17 to sales this was driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 21 to sales the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2017 both rb foods and giotti and in 2016 principally gourmet garden added 65 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange that reduced sales by 07 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 103 on a constant currency basis 



in 2017 gross profit rose 10 basis points to 416 from 415 in 2016 as the favorable impact of pricing actions cciled cost savings and more favorable business mix more than offset the unfavorable material cost inflation including unfavorable foreign currency effects in addition our gross profit for 2017 was burdened by 209 million of transaction and integration expenses representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of rb foods that depressed our fiscal 2017 gross profit margin of 416 by 40 basis points excluding those transaction and integration expenses adjusted gross profit margin rose 50 basis points from 415 in 2016 to 420 in 2017 



selling general and administrative expense was 12448 million in 2017 compared to 11750 million in 2016 an increase of 698 million that increase in sga expense was driven by the impact of acquisitions together with increased brand marketing and higher freight costs partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs related to both completed and uncompleted acquisitions all as compared to the 2016 levels the lower acquisitionrelated costs in the 2017 period were primarily the result of costs associated with our investigation in 2016 of a large potential acquisition in the uk that we ultimately declined to pursue in addition acquisitionrelated costs attributable to rb foods in 2017 are not included in sga expense but are instead included in transaction and integration expenses in our income statement and are further discussed below sga expense as a percentage of net sales was 258 an 80basis point improvement from 2016 driving this reduction in sga expense as a percentage of net sales in addition to the items described above were lower employee benefit expense including lower pension and other postretirement benefit expense together with benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the financial statements 



we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizational structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our management committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements special charges of 222 million were recorded in 2017 and 160 million in 2016 to enable us to implement these changes 

during 2017 we recorded 222 million of special charges consisting primarily of 127 million related to third party expenses incurred as part of our evaluation of changes relating to our global enablement initiative 28 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with the relocation of one of our chinese manufacturing facilities 25 million for severance and other exit costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in portugal and 17 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with actions related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to a new facility under construction in thailand see note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges 

of the 160 million of special charges recorded in 2016 03 million were recorded in cost of goods sold the 2016 special charges principally consist of 57 million related to our emea reorganization which began in 2015 28 million related to our exit from a consolidated joint venture in south africa 19 million for other exit costs related to the discontinuance of nonprofitable product lines of our kohinoor business in india initiated in 2015 18 million associated with actions in connection with our planned exit of two leased manufacturing facilities in singapore and thailand and 17 million for employee severance actions related to our north american effectiveness initiative begun in 2015 



total transaction and integration expenses related to the rb foods acquisition are anticipated to approximate 100 million of which approximately 60 million represent transaction expenses and the remainder represent estimated integration expenses these costs are anticipated to be incurred through 2018 and primarily consist of amortization of the acquisitiondate fair value adjustment of inventories of 209 million that is included in cost of goods sold outside advisory service and consulting costs employeerelated costs and other costs related to the acquisition including the costs related to the bridge financing commitment of 154 million that is included in other debt costs of the total anticipated transaction and integration expenses we incurred 771 million in 2017 and expect to incur the balance in 2018 



interest expense for 2017 was sharply higher than the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings related to our incurrence of 37 billion in debt in august to finance the acquisition of rb foods see note 6 of the financial statements other income net for 2017 was 07 million lower than the 2016 level primarily due to a gain on the 2016 sale of a nonoperating asset 



the effective tax rate decreased 60 basis points to 254 in 2017 from 260 in 2016 primarily because of an increase in net discrete tax benefits net discrete tax benefits increased by 31 million from 211 million in 2016 to 242 million in 2017 in 2017 discrete items include 107 million of excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments to employees due to our adoption of asu no 201609 stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting on a prospective basis as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year see note 1 of the financial statements for further details with respect to our adoption of this accounting standard both 2017 and 2016 included discrete tax benefits for the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided for the expiration of statutes of limitation and in 2017 settlements with taxing authorities in several tax jurisdictions discrete tax expense in 2017 included expense associated with the establishment of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets discrete tax items in 2016 included benefits associated with the reversal of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 

as the us tax act was enacted after our year end of november 30 2017 it had no impact on our fiscal 2017 financial results 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 22 million in 2017 from the prior year this decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of eliminating earnings associated with our minority interests in 2017 as compared to a loss in 2016 and lower earnings from our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico for which the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates more than offset the favorable impact in local currency of higher sales and net income we own 50 of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures including mccormick de mexico which represented 57 of the sales and 74 of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2017 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 372 in 2017 compared to 369 in 2016 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2016 to 2017 the increase in operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2017 



we measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income excluding special charges and beginning in 2017 excluding transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition see note 16 of the financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment of operating income excluding special charges as well as transaction and integration expenses related to our rb foods acquisition to consolidated operating income in the following discussion we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as segment operating income 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment grew by 79 as compared to 2016 and grew by 80 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 03 to sales and pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 22 the incremental impact of acquisitions – mainly rb foods and gourmet garden completed in 2017 and 2016 respectively – added 55 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced consumer segment sales by 01 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 80 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas consumer sales rose 112 in 2017 as compared to 2016 and rose by 111 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 05 to sales pricing actions added 28 to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions – mainly rb foods and gourmet garden – added 78 to sales the favorable impact of foreign currency increased sales by 01 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 111 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region consumer sales declined 16 in 2017 as compared to 2016 and declined 23 on a constant currency basis volume and product mix lowered sales by 33 with weakness in poland the uk and france the sales weakness in poland was driven by competitive conditions while weakness in the uk related to a difficult retail environment including the effects of a reduction of schwartz brand products by a large uk retailer pricing added 05 to sales and the incremental impact of the rb foods and gourmet garden acquisitions added 05 to sales the favorable impact of foreign currency increased sales by 07 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 23 on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 64 as compared to 2016 and increased 89 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 51 to sales with strong results in china that offset a volume and product mix decline in india in 2017 due in part to indias discontinuation of lowermargin product lines that occurred in 2016 pricing added 17 to sales and the incremental impact of the gourmet garden acquisition 

added 21 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 25 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 89 on a constant currency basis 

we grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by 734 million or 150 in 2017 compared to 2016 the favorable impact of greater sales and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and an increase in brand marketing on a constant currency basis segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 149 segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 120 basis points to 190 in 2017 from 178 in 2016 

industrial segment 



sales of our industrial segment increased 124 as compared to 2016 and increased by 140 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 40 to sales and pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 20 the incremental impact on 2017 industrial sales of the rb foods and giotti acquisitions completed in 2017 added 80 to sales these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced industrial segment sales by 16 compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 140 on a constant currency basis

results of operations—2016 compared to 2015 



sales for 2016 increased 27 from 2015 and increased by 55 on a constant currency basis with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments that drove higher volume and product mix and added 17 to sales this was driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 15 to sales the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2016 – mainly gourmet garden – and three acquisitions completed in 2015 – brand aromatics drogheria  alimentari da and stubb’s – added 23 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange that reduced sales by 28 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 55 on a constant currency basis 



in 2016 gross profit rose 110 basis points to 415 from 404 in 2015 as the favorable impact of pricing actions cciled cost savings and more favorable business mix more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs

interest expense for 2016 was higher than the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings other income net for 2016 rose by 31 million over the 2015 level primarily due to higher interest income and lower nonoperating foreign currency losses both as compared to 2015 as well as to a gain on the 2016 sale of a nonoperating asset 



the effective tax rate decreased 50 basis points to 260 in 2016 from 265 in 2015 primarily as a result of the following factors net discrete tax benefits increased by 20 million from 191 million in 2015 to 211 million in 2016 both 2016 and 2015 included discrete tax benefits for i the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided for the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions ii the reversal of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets and iii prior year adjustments for the research tax credit related to legislation enacted subsequent to the reporting dates a portion of the 2015 discrete tax benefit was offset by a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the uk resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 reducing the statutory tax rate for future periods 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 06 million in 2016 from the prior year this decrease was mainly attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico for which the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates more than offset the favorable impact in local currency of higher sales and net income in 2016 our 50 interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 57 of the sales and 83 of the income of our unconsolidated operations we own 50 of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures

nongaap financial measures 

the following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit adjusted gross profit margin adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted income from unconsolidated operations adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share these financial measures also exclude for 2018 and the comparison of our expected results for 2018 to 2017 the net estimated impact of the effects of the deemed repatriation tax and remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the recent us tax legislation as these items will significantly impact comparability between years these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united 

states generally accepted accounting principles these financial measures exclude the impact as applicable of the following 

 details with respect to the composition of special charges as well as transaction and integration expenses including other debt costs recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2 and 3 respectively of the financial statements 

we believe that these nongaap financial measures are important the exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

these nongaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting 

a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below in millions except per share data 







because we are a multinational company we are subject to variability of our reported us dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis” is a nongaap measure we believe that this nongaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the us it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows 1 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2017 on a constant currency basis net sales and adjusted operating income for 2017 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2016 and compared to the reported results for 2016 and 2 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2016 on a constant currency basis net sales and operating income for 2016 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2015 and compared to the reported results for 2015 

  





to present information for the fiscal year 2018 projection on a constant currency basis projected sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the companys budgeted exchange rates for 2018 and are compared to the 2017 results translated into us dollars using the same 2018 budgeted exchange rates rather than at the average actual exchange rates in effect during fiscal year 2017 



in addition to the above nongaap financial measures we use a leverage ratio which is determined using nongaap measures a leverage ratio is a widelyused measure of ability to repay outstanding debt obligations and is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating financial leverage we believe that our leverage ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate such a leverage ratio we determine our leverage ratio as net debt which we define as total debt net of cash in excess of 750 million to adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses for interest income taxes depreciation and amortization less interest income and as further adjusted for cash and noncash acquisitionrelated transaction and integration expenses which may include the effect of the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory on cost of goods sold special charges and stockbased compensation expenses adjusted ebitda and our leverage ratio are both nongaap financial measures our determination of the leverage ratio is consistent with the terms of our 10 billion revolving credit facility and our term loans which require us to maintain our leverage ratio below certain levels under those agreements the applicable leverage ratio is reduced annually commencing on november 30 2018 as of november 30 2017 our capacity under the revolving credit facility is not affected by these covenants we do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future however the leverage ratio could restrict our ability to utilize this facility we expect to comply with this financial covenant for the foreseeable future 

the following table reconciles our net income to adjusted ebitda for the years ended november 30 2017 2016 and 2015 



  



our longterm target for our leverage ratio is 15 to 18 our leverage ratio can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity 

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives service our debt increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business we generate much of our cash flow in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2017 the exchange rates for the euro the british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty and chinese renminbi were higher versus the us dollar than at november 30 2016 

operating cash flow –  operating cash flow was 8153 million in 2017 6581 million in 2016 and 5900 million in 2015 the improvement in cash flow from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to improvements in cash flow generated from inventories and accounts payable and a higher level of noncash items that impacted net income which was partially offset by the timing of employee benefit payments the improvement in cash flow from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 is predominantly due to higher net income resulting principally from higher sales and gross profit a decrease in cash payments related to special charges and the impact of higher income tax and employee benefit accruals 

our working capital management –  principally related to inventory trade accounts receivable and accounts payable –  impacts our operating cash flow the change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations it was a significant source of cash in 2017 a significant use of cash in 2016 and a less significant use of cash in 2015 when compared to 2016 the change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years as it was a use of cash in 2017 and 2016 and a source of cash in 2015 the change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in all three years but more so in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015 dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates which were lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 and higher in 2016 as compared to 2015 also impacted our cash flow from operations 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decrease in ccc in 2017 from 2016 is due to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers and to a lesser extent a decrease in our days in inventory the decrease in ccc in 2016 from 2015 is mainly due to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers 

investing cash flow –  net cash used in investing activities was 45083 million in 2017 2671 million in 2016 and 3389 million in 2015 the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses which amounted to 43274 million in 2017 1206 million in 2016 and 2109 million in 2015 see note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to these acquisitions capital expenditures were 1824 million in 2017 1538 million in 2016 and 1284 million in 2015 we expect 2018 capital expenditures to approximate 200 million to support our planned growth 

financing cash flow –  net cash provided by financing activities was 37560 million in 2017 as compared to a cash usage of 3715 million in 2016 and 1996 million in 2015 the variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings share repurchase activity and dividends both as described below in 2017 2016 and 2015 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 35746 million 557 million and 1180 million respectively in 2017 we issued 40000 million of longterm debt including 25000 million of notes and 15000 million of term loans see note 6 of the financial statements for additional information with respect to this longterm debt the net proceeds from the issuance of this longterm debt were 39776 million we also paid 77 million of costs associated with the issuance of debt and our 10 billion revolving credit facility in 2017 we repaid 2727 million of longterm debt including 2688 million of our 15000 million term loans issued in august 2017 

in 2016 net proceeds from shortterm borrowings of 2517 million were used to pay off 200 million of 520 notes that matured in december 2015 and for general corporate purposes in 2015 we received net cash proceeds of 2465 million from our issuance of 2500 million of 325 notes due 2025 the net proceeds from this offering were used to pay down shortterm borrowings and for general corporate purposes in 2015 

in 2017 and 2015 we repaid 1346 million and 1274 million respectively of shortterm borrowings 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 



as of november 30 2017 189 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in march 2015 the timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors in connection with our august 2017 acquisition of rb foods we announced our intention to reduce our leverage ratio by curtailing the repurchases of shares under our share repurchase program 

during 2017 we issued approximately 635 million shares of our common stock nonvoting to fund our acquisition of rb foods see notes 2 and 13 of the financial statements which included approximately 08 million shares from the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares the net proceeds from this issuance after the underwriting discount and related expenses was 5540 million in addition we also issued 295 million of common stock related to our stock compensation plans in 2017 all of the common stock issued in 2016 and 2015 relates to our stock compensation plans including the effects of the related excess tax benefits 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2017 the board of directors approved a 106 increase in the quarterly dividend from 047 to 052 per share 

the following table presents our leverage ratios for the trailing twelve month periods ended november 30 2017 2016 and 2015 



our leverage ratio was 51 as of november 30 2017 as compared to the ratios of 17 and 18 as of november 30 2016 and 2015 respectively the increase in the ratio from 17 as of november 30 2016 to 51 as of november 30 2017 is principally due to an increase in total debt associated with the funding net of cash flow from operations for 2017 of our acquisitions of rb foods and giotti repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends 

the leverage ratio covenant in our 10 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements both outstanding at november 30 2017 provide that adjusted ebitda under that covenant also include the pro forma impact of acquisitions as of november 30 2017 our leverage ratio under the terms of those agreements is 45 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed prior to the enactment of the us tax act on december 22 2017 the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at november 30 2017 we temporarily used 434 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2017 and 2016 were 6306 million and 6038 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2017 and 2016 was 29966 million and 16588 million respectively 

see notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets  – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities  – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in august 2017 we entered into a fiveyear 10 billion revolving credit facility which will expire in august 2022 the current pricing for the credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 125 the pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to libor plus 175 this facility replaces our prior facilities i a fiveyear 750 million revolving credit facility that was due to expire in june 2020 and ii a 364day 250 million revolving facility which we entered into in the second quarter of 2017 and that was due to expire in march 2018 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 2331 million as of november 30 2017 that will expire in 2018 we engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 187 million in 2017 251 million in 2016 and 157 million in 2015 it is expected that the 2018 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 5 million primarily for international plans future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 64 of assets are invested in equities 26 in fixed income investments and 10 in other investments assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 50 in equities and 50 in fixed income investments see note 10 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2017 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the british pound sterling euro polish zloty chinese yuan and australian dollar we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2017 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2017 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2017 



we had a number of smaller contracts at november 30 2017 with an aggregate notional value of 111 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc and the romanian leu the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 02 million at november 30 2017 

at november 30 2016 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and polish zloty with a notional value of 4492 million all of which matured in 2017 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 05 million at november 30 2016 

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2017 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

years of maturity at november 30 2017 



the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects 

 commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2017 our most significant raw materials were pepper dairy products garlic vanilla capsicums red peppers and paprika onion wheat flour and rice while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future 

delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2017 

contractual cash obligations due by year 





 

the contractual cash obligations table above does not reflect any estimated lease payment obligation with respect to a 15year lease for a headquarters building in hunt valley maryland which we entered into in july 2016 the lease which is expected to commence upon completion of building construction and fitout currently scheduled for the second half of 2018 will require monthly lease payments of approximately 09 million beginning six months after lease commencement that monthly lease payment is subject to adjustment after an initial 60month period and thereafter on an annual basis as specified in the lease agreement in addition the initial 09 million monthly lease payment is subject to an increase in the event of agreedupon changes to specifications related to the headquarters building see note 6 of the financial statements for additional details 

pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2017 and 2016 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2017 we had 44901 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 33854 million in the consumer segment and 11047 million in the industrial segment   included in those amounts are 25463 million 16975 million in the consumer segment and 8488 million in the industrial segment of goodwill related to our acquisition of rb foods that as of november 30 2017 was determined on a preliminary basis the final valuation of the acquired net assets of rb foods and the related goodwill balance by segment will be completed in 2018 our fiscal year 2017 testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a relieffromroyalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

as of november 30 2017 we had 28085 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceeded their calculated fair values excluding i the brand names associated with the 2017 rb foods acquisition which were based upon a preliminary valuation of the acquired net assets ii the brand names associated with other acquisitions in 2017 2016 and 2015 including giotti gourmet garden brand aromatics da and stubbs iii the kohinoor brand name that was written down to its estimated fair value in 

2015 and iv the kamis brand name as discussed below the percentage excess of estimated fair value over book values for our major brand names and trademarks is 40 or more as of november 30 2017 

the following table outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2017 



a book value for the frenchs franks redhot and cattlemens brand names as of november 30 2017 is based on a preliminary valuation of the acquired net assets of rb foods and will be adjusted upon finalization of this valuation in 2018 

the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value for the kamis brand name as of november 30 2017 was approximately 14 a change in assumptions with respect to future performance of the kamis business could result in impairment losses in the future 

the brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions in particular our most recent – and most significant – acquisition rb foods may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values a change in assumptions with respect to future performance of these recently acquired businesses or a change in other assumptions could result in impairment losses in the future 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2018 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 10 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2018 pension expense by approximately 9 million 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in addition see note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements

our industrial segment has a number of competitors some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach other competitors include larger publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature but which also tend to specialize in a narrower range of flavor solutions than mccormick 

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are pepper dairy products capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice wheat flour and vanilla pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced from within the us and locally for many of our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program 

customers 

our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers wholesalers and distributors in the consumer segment products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels including grocery mass merchandise warehouse clubs discount and drug stores and ecommerce in the industrial segment products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors

we also own various patents none of which are individually material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter 

due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis” 

competition 

each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive in this competitive environment our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights additionally in the consumer segment we are building brand recognition and loyalty through increased advertising and promotions 

research and development 

many of our products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by our research laboratories and product development teams and in some cases from proprietary customer formulas expenditures for research and development were 610 million in 2016  608 million in 2015  and 620 million in 2014  the amount spent on customersponsored research activities is not material

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves risks including the risks described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to 

increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing such as the emergence of new sales channels like ecommerce and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business our industrial segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial segment declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 22 of our consolidated sales in 2016  the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper dairy products capsicums red peppers 

and paprika garlic onion rice wheat flour and vanilla while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our cci program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacturing storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification the import and export of products and product ingredients employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately 

compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

our foreign and crossborder operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2016  42 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties several countries within the european union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union and the united kingdom uk additionally international sales together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the us are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the decision by british voters to exit the european union may negatively impact our operations 

the june 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union “brexit” adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other currencies as the uk negotiates its exit from the european union volatility in exchange rates and in uk interest rates may continue in the near term a weaker british pound compared to the us dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars a weaker british pound compared to other currencies increases the cost of goods imported into our uk operations and may decrease the profitability of our uk operations and a higher uk interest rate may have a dampening effect on the uk economy in the longer term any impact from brexit on our uk operations will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 390 million at an average interest rate of approximately 14 on november 30 2016  our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently we rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control including those involving cyber attacks using viruses worms or other destructive software process breakdowns or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing such breaches could result in unauthorized access to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data we invest in security technology and design our business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches while we believe these measures are generally effective there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which has been material to us to date however a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation regulatory enforcement proceedings and direct costs associated with incident response 

the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is 

inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or damage our reputation 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions and exit certain businesses or lines of business these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase operating income 7 to 9 and increase earnings per share 9 to 11 over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support customer intimacy expanded distribution and category growth 2 product innovation and 3 acquisitions we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

our business generates strong cash flow and we have a balanced use of cash we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 31 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases each year we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2016 we achieved further growth of our business although sales and earnings reported in us dollars were unfavorably impacted by the strength of the us dollar and the resultant unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange as compared to 2015 net sales rose 27 over the 2015 level as a result of the following factors 

 operating income was 6410 million in 2016 and 5484 million in 2015 we recorded 160 million of special charges in 2016 related to organization and streamlining actions and in 2015 recorded 655 million of special charges in 2016 compared to the yearago period the favorable impact of higher sales and 1090 million of cost savings from our cci program and organization and streamlining actions more than offset higher material costs and an 116 million increase in brand marketing excluding the aforementioned special charges adjusted operating income was 6570 million an increase of 7 compared to 6139 million in the yearago period in constant currency adjusted operating income rose 9 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see nongaap financial measures 

diluted earnings per share was 369 in 2016 and 311 in 2015 the yearonyear increase in earnings per share was driven mainly by higher operating income which reflected lower special charges and lower shares outstanding special charges lowered earnings per share by 009 and 037 in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges adjusted diluted earnings per share was 378 in 2016 and 348 in 2015 this was an increase of 9 despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange 

mccormick continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 6581 million in 2016 an increase from 5900 million in 2015 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2016 that return of cash to our shareholders was 4605 million 

results of operations—2016 compared to 2015 



sales for the fiscal year 2016 increased 27 from 2015 and by 55 on a constant currency basis that is excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption nongaap financial measures both the consumer and industrial segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 17 to sales this was driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 15 to sales the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2016–mainly gourmet garden–and three acquisitions completed in 2015–brand aromatics drogheria  alimentari da and stubb’s–added 23 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange that reduced sales by 28 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 55 on a constant currency basis 

in 2017 we expect to grow sales 3 to 5 with further increases in volume and product mix and pricing actions to offset a projected increase in material costs we also expect incremental sales from the acquisition of gourmet garden completed during fiscal year 2016 and an industrial acquisition completed in december 2016 and described in note 19 to our financial statements we anticipate that these sales increases will be offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange during 2017 



in 2016 gross profit rose 110 basis points to 415 from 404 in 2015 as the favorable impact of pricing actions cciled cost savings and more favorable business mix more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs in 2017 we expect gross profit margin to range from comparable to approximately 50 basis points higher than 2016 due to the favorable impact of pricing actions and cost savings net of the unfavorable impact of higher material costs 



selling general and administrative expenses were 11750 million in 2016 compared to 11274 million in 2015 an increase of 476 million sga as a percentage of net sales was 266 a 40 basis point increase from 2015 driving this increase in sga as a percentage of net sales were higher employee related expenses an 116 million increase in our brand marketing from the 2015 level to 2522 million in 2016 and a 65 million increase in transaction costs related to both completed and uncompleted acquisitions from the 2015 level to 134 million in 2016 partially offsetting these increases were cost savings from cci and from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements 



we regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future from time to time those changes are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizationalstructural impact that we obtain advance approval from our management committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements special charges of 160 million were recorded in 2016 and 655 million in 2015 to enable us to implement these changes of the 160 million of special charges recorded in 2016 03 million were recorded in cost of goods sold the 2016 special charges principally consist of 57 million related to our emea reorganization which began in 2015 28 million related to our exit from a consolidated joint venture in south africa 19 million for other exit costs related to the discontinuance of nonprofitable product lines of our kohinoor business in india initiated in 2015 18 million associated with actions in connection with our planned exit of two leased manufacturing facilities in singapore and thailand and 17 million for employee severance actions related to our north american effectiveness initiative begun in 2015 see note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges 

in 2015 we recorded special charges of 655 million of which 292 million related to employee severance and related costs associated with our north american effectiveness initiative and 244 million related to a reorganization of our emea business an additional 142 million including a noncash brand impairment charge of 96 million related to the discontinuance by our kohinoor consumer business in india of sales of nonprofitable bulkpackaged and broken basmati rice product lines partially offsetting these charges was a credit of 23 million for the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of special charges in 2014 and 2013 



interest expense for 2016 was higher than the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings other income net for 2016 rose by 31 million over the 2015 level primarily due to higher interest income and lower nonoperating foreign currency losses both as compared to 2015 as well as to a gain on the 2016 sale of a nonoperating asset 



the effective tax rate decreased 50 basis points to 260 in 2016 from 265 in 2015 primarily as a result of the following factors net discrete tax benefits increased by 20 million from 191 million in 2015 to 211 million in 2016 both 2016 and 2015 included discrete tax benefits for i the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided for the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions ii the reversal of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets and iii prior year adjustments for the research tax credit related to legislation enacted subsequent to the reporting dates a portion of the 2015 discrete tax benefit was offset by a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the uk resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 reducing the statutory tax rate for future periods see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 

we expect an effective tax rate in 2017 of approximately 28 including a favorable effect from our planned adoption of the new accounting standards update no 201609 stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  as more fully described in note 1 of the financial statements we expect that the adoption of this new guidance in fiscal 2017 will reduce our effective income tax rate however the ultimate amount of that reduction is dependent upon the underlying vesting or exercise activity and related future stock prices 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 06 million in 2016 from the prior year this decrease was mainly attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico for which the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates more than offset the favorable impact in local currency of higher sales and net income in 2016 our 50 interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 57 of the sales and 83 of the income of our unconsolidated operations we own 50 of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures 

in 2017 we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be comparable to 2016 mainly due to the continued unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on mccormick de mexico 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 369 in 2016 compared to 311 in 2015 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2015 to 2016 the increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2016 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer segment 

  



we grew sales of our consumer segment by 45 as compared to 2015 and by 64 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 17 to sales and pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 12 the incremental impact in 2016 of acquisitions completed in that year–mainly gourmet garden–and two acquisitions completed in 2015–drogheria  alimentari da and stubb’s–added 35 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced consumer segment sales by 19 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 64 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas consumer sales rose 58 in 2016 as compared to 2015 and rose by 63 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 22 to sales led by us sales growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes and driven by product innovation brand marketing particularly in digital and working with retailers on instore product assortment pricing and promotion pricing actions added 14 to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions–mainly gourmet garden and stubbs–added 27 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact of foreign currency that reduced sales by 05 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 63 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region consumer sales rose 24 in 2016 as compared to 2015 and rose 69 on a constant currency basis volume and product mix lowered sales by 04 with growth in poland and france offset by weakness in the uk the sales growth in poland and france was driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution while weakness in the uk related to a difficult retail environment pricing added 15 to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions–mainly da–added 58 to sales an unfavorable impact from 

foreign currency rates reduced sales by 45 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 69 on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 15 as compared to 2015 and increased 63 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 22 to sales with strong results in both china and australia volume and product mix in india declined in 2016 compared to 2015 due in part to the discontinuation of lowermargin bulkpackaged and broken rice product lines pricing added 03 to sales and the incremental impact of acquisitions–gourmet garden–added 38 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 48 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 63 on a constant currency basis 

we grew operating income excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our consumer segment by 347 million or 76 in 2016 compared to 2015 the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and an increase in brand marketing on a constant currency basis operating income excluding special charges rose 87 excluding the impact of special charges the consumer segment operating income margin rose by 50 basis points to 178 in 2016 from 173 in 2015 

industrial segment 



sales of our industrial business declined 02 as compared to 2015 but increased by 39 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 15 to sales and pricing actions taken in response to increased material costs added 20 the incremental impact on 2016 industrial sales of the brand aromatics acquisition completed in 2015 added 04 to sales these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced industrial segment sales by 41 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 39 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas industrial sales rose 17 in 2016 as compared to 2015 and rose 37 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 14 to sales and included growth in sales of branded foodservice products in the us and snack seasonings in the us and mexico pricing actions added 17 to sales and the incremental impact of the brand aromatics acquisition added 06 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced sales by 20 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 37 on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region industrial sales declined 64 in 2016 as compared to 2015 but increased 48 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 11 to sales and included growth in sales to leading quick service restaurants in this region pricing actions added 37 to sales these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 112 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 48 on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region industrial sales declined 01 in 2016 as compared to 2015 but increased by 38 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 30 to sales and included growth in sales to leading quick service restaurants supplied from our facilities in both australia and southeast asia that offset weakness in china that resulted in large part from a decision by a large customer to add a secondary supply source pricing actions added 08 to sales these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 39 compared to 2015 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 38 on a constant currency basis 

we grew operating income excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our industrial segment by 84 million or 53 in 2016 compared to 2015 the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs on a constant currency basis operating income excluding special charges rose 116 excluding the impact of special charges the industrial segment operating income margin rose by 50 basis points to 100 in 2016 from 95 in 2015 and included the impact of our efforts to shift our business mix to more valueadded products through innovation and acquisitions 

results of operations—2015 compared to 2014 



sales for the fiscal year 2015 increased by 13 from 2014 and by 64 on a constant currency basis with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments higher volume and product mix added 39 to sales driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution including new retail channels and new geographic regions pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 11 to sales the incremental impact of the three acquisitions completed in 2015–brand aromatics drogheria  alimentari da and stubb’s–added 14 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates that reduced 2015 sales compared to 2014 by 51 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 



in 2015 gross profit was comparable to 2014 gross profit margin declined 40 basis points from the 2014 level to 404 this decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the impact of a midsingle digit increase in material costs partially offset by cost savings and pricing actions in 2015 cci cost savings as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements totaled 98 million of which 66 million lowered cost of goods sold lower gross profit from our kohinoor business in india also impacted gross profit margin in 2015 and as a result toward the end of 2015 we decided to discontinue the lower margin bulkpackaged and broken rice product lines of our kohinoor business 



selling general and administrative expenses were 11274 million in 2015 compared to 11220 million in 2014 an increase of 54 million sga as a percentage of net sales was 262 a 30 basis point reduction from 2014 driving this reduction in sga as a percentage of net sales were cost savings from cci and from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements as well as the benefit of higher sales partly offset by higher benefits expense and a 14 million increase in our brand marketing from the 2014 level to 2406 million in 2015 in connection with our acquisitions of brand aromatics da and stubb’s we incurred 36 million of transaction costs which were included in sga 



special charges of 655 million were recorded in 2015 and 52 million in 2014 to enable us to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness of the 655 million of special charges recorded in 2015 40 million were recorded in cost of goods sold of that 655 million 292 million related to employee severance and related costs associated with our north american effectiveness initiative and 244 million related to our emea reorganization initiated earlier in 2015 an additional 142 million related to our kohinoor consumer business in india partially offsetting these charges was a credit of 23 million for the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of special charges in 2014 and 2013 see note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges 

in 2014 we recorded special charges of 21 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in late 2013 13 million related to the realignment of certain manufacturing activities in the us industrial business 11 million related to the elimination of certain administrative positions in the us consumer and industrial businesses and 07 million related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in the australian consumer business 



interest expense for 2015 was higher than the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings 



the effective tax rate increased 20 basis points to 265 in 2015 from 263 in 2014 primarily as a result of the following factors net discrete tax benefits increased by 83 million from 108 million in 2014 to 191 million in 2015 both 2015 and 2014 included reversals of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided for various income tax audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions in addition 2015 included a net discrete tax benefit for i the reversal of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets and ii a prior year adjustment for the 2014 research tax credit related to legislation enacted in 2015 offset by iii a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the uk resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 which reduced the uk statutory tax rate in future periods the increase in net discrete tax benefits in 2015 as compared to 2014 was more than offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015 that unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015 as compared to the prior year resulted from the higher percentage of us pretax earnings in 2015 that are taxed at a federal statutory rate of 35 as well as an increase in nonus losses in jurisdictions where income tax benefits could not be recognized as it is more likely than not that the resultant deferred tax assets will not be realized see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations rose 73 million in 2015 from the prior year which was a 248 increase despite the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates this increase is attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico which achieved higher sales and an increase in gross margin percentage in 2015 our 50 interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 60 of the sales and 89 of the income of our unconsolidated operations we own 50 of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 311 in 2015 compared to 334 in 2014 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2014 to 2015 the increase in adjusted operating income and increase in income from unconsolidated operations in the table below includes a significant impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2015 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment increased 04 as compared to 2014 and increased 53 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 38 to consumer sales and higher pricing related to material cost changes added 01 our acquisitions of da and stubb’s during the second and third quarters respectively added 14 to sales in 2015 these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced consumer sales by 49 compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 53 on a constant currency basis 

in the americas consumer sales rose 18 in 2015 as compared to 2014 and rose 32 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix increased sales by 24 and pricing added 05 higher volume and product mix was led by us sales growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes this is an improvement over the 2014 sales results and was driven by product innovation brand marketing particularly in digital and our work with retailers on instore product assortment pricing and promotion the acquisition of stubb’s which closed in august 2015 added 03 to sales in 2015 these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 14 from the 2014 level and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region consumer sales decreased 50 as compared to 2014 but increased by 103 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix increased sales by 47 as compared to 2014 and higher pricing added 03 the acquisition of da which closed in may 2015 added 53 to sales in 2015 our core business growth in the emea region was led by poland france and russia and driven by our higher brand marketing new product innovation and expanded distribution these factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 153 compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 26 as compared to 2014 and increased by 66 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix increased sales by 83 as compared to 2014 but were partly offset by a 17 reduction from pricing in 2015 sales in china increased at a doubledigit rate due in part to expanded distribution while sales in india declined due in part to the discontinuation of lowermargin bulkpackaged and broken rice product lines as well as lower pricing on basmati rice the net effect of these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 40 compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

operating income excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our consumer segment decreased 182 million or 38 compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis operating income for 2015 excluding special charges decreased 04 with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of higher material costs increased employee benefit expense and a 4 increase in brand marketing the decrease in operating income led to lower operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges the consumer segment operating income margin was 173 in 2015 and 181 in 2014 

industrial segment 

  



sales of our industrial segment increased by 27 in 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased by 82 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix added 43 to sales as compared to 2014 and higher pricing related to material cost changes added 26 our acquisition of brand aromatics in march 2015 added 13 to sales these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced sales by 55 from the 2014 level and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

in the americas industrial sales rose 32 as compared to 2014 and increased by 64 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix increased sales by 13 compared to 2014 and higher pricing increased sales by 31 higher volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in both the us and mexico as well as branded foodservice products in the us the acquisition of brand aromatics added 20 to industrial sales in the americas in 2015 these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 32 as compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

in the emea region industrial sales increased by 08 as compared to 2014 and increased by 126 on a constant currency basis sales in 2015 reflected an increase of 104 attributable to higher volume and product mix and 22 from higher pricing the strong sales performance reflected our support for the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 118 from the 2014 level and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

in the asiapacific region industrial sales increased 29 as compared to 2014 and increased by 102 on a constant currency basis higher volume and product mix increased sales by 99 as compared to the prior year and higher pricing increased sales by 03 in 2015 we increased sales to quick service restaurant customers in china and other markets across this region these factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 73 as compared to 2014 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth on a constant currency basis 

operating income excluding special charges–our measure of segment profit–for our industrial segment increased 239 million or 178 compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis operating income for 2015 excluding special charges increased 245 above 2014 with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and increased employee benefit expense the significant increase in operating income led to higher operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges the industrial segment operating income margin was 95 in 2015 and 83 in 2014 this also reflects a shift in the business mix to more valueadded products including the acquisition of brand aromatics 

nongaap financial measures 

the tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income adjusted income from unconsolidated operations adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share each excluding the impact of special charges in 2016 2015 and 2014 these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles in our consolidated income statement we include a separate line item captioned “special charges” in arriving at our consolidated operating income additionally we recorded 03 million and 40 million in cost of goods sold in our income statements for 2016 and 2015 respectively which we classified as special charges 

special charges consist of expenses including related impairment charges associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizationalstructural impact to require advance approval by our management committee comprised of our president and chief executive officer executive vice president and chief financial officer president global industrial and mccormick international president global consumer and north america and senior vice president human relations upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a noncash component such as an asset impairment or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold impacted employees or operations expected timing and expected savings to the management committee and the committee’s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion certain ancillary expenses related to these actions approved by our management committee do not qualify for accrual upon approval but are included as special charges as incurred during the course of the action details with respect to the composition of special charges recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements 

we believe these nongaap financial measures are important to investors the exclusion of special charges provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

these nongaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner as we do we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions where applicable and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below in millions except per share data 



1 in 2016 represents the portion of the total special charge of 28 million associated with our exit of a consolidated joint venture in south africa attributable to our former joint venture partner in 2015 represents the portion of the kohinoor total special charge of 142 million attributable to kohinoors 15 minority stakeholder 

2 total special charges of 160 million for 2016 655 million for 2015 and 52 million for 2014 are net of taxes of 30 million 156 million and 15 million respectively 

because we are a multinational company we are subject to variability of our reported us dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis” is a nongaap measure we believe that this nongaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the us it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows 1 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2016 on a constant currency basis net sales and adjusted operating income for 2016 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2015 and compared to the reported results for 2015 and 2 to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2015 on a constant currency basis net sales and operating income for 2015 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2014 and compared to the reported results for 2014 

  





in addition to the above nongaap measures we use total debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda as a measure of leverage we define ebitda as net income plus expenses of interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are both nongaap financial measures this ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations our target for total debt to ebitda is 15 to 18 our total debt to ebitda can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity we believe that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda 

 the following table reconciles our ebitda to our net income 



  

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases 

when appropriate in 2017 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions with cash flow from operations 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2016 the exchange rates for the british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty and chinese renminbi were lower versus the us dollar than at november 30 2015 at november 30 2016 the exchange rate for the australian dollar was higher versus the us dollar than at november 30 2015 at november 30 2016 the exchange rate for the euro versus the us dollar approximated the comparable rate at november 30 2015 

operating cash flow –  operating cash flow was 6581 million in 2016 5900 million in 2015 and 5036 million in 2014 the improvement in cash flow from operations in 2016 compared to 2015 is predominantly due to higher net income resulting principally from higher sales and gross profit a decrease in cash payments related to special charges and the impact of higher employee benefit accruals the improvement in cash flow from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to improvements in the three main components of working capital trade accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable the change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years as it was a use of cash in 2016 a source of cash in 2015 and a use of cash in 2014 while the change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations it was a less significant use of cash in 2015 when compared to 2016 and 2014 the change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in 2016 and 2015 compared to a moderate use of cash in 2014 dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates were higher in 2016 and 2015 when compared to 2014 contributing to the increased cash flow from operations in 2016 and 2015 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decrease in ccc in 2016 from 2015 is mainly due to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers the decrease in ccc in 2015 from 2014 is mainly due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding resulting from new contractual terms with a large customer 

investing cash flow –  net cash used in investing activities was 2671 million in 2016 3389 million in 2015 and 1316 million in 2014 the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses which amounted to 1206 million in 2016 and 2109 million in 2015 we did not make any acquisitions in 2014 see note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to the 2016 and 2015 acquisitions capital expenditures were 1538 million in 2016 1284 million in 2015 and 1327 million in 2014 we expect 2017 capital expenditures to range between 170 million and 190 million to support our growth 

financing cash flow –  net cash used in financing activities was 3715 million in 2016 1996 million in 2015 and 3489 million in 2014 the variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase activity described below and of changes in our net borrowings in 2016 2015 and 2014 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 557 million 1180 million and 561 million respectively in 2015 we received net cash proceeds of 2465 million from our issuance of 250 million of 325 notes due 2025 the net proceeds from this offering were used to pay down shortterm borrowings and for general corporate purposes in 2015 in 2016 proceeds from shortterm 

borrowings were used to pay off 200 million of 520 notes that matured in december 2015 and for general corporate purposes 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 



as of november 30 2016 327 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in march 2015 

the common stock issued in 2016 2015 and 2014 relates to our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2016 the board of directors approved a 93 increase in the quarterly dividend from 043 to 047 per share 



the decrease in our total debt to ebitda from 2015 to 2016 is due to higher net income ebitda used in the 2016 calculation is 979 million higher than the ebitda used in the 2015 calculation ebitda for 2015 was lower in part due to the impact of a higher level of special charges the increase in our total debt to ebitda from 2014 to 2015 is mainly due to higher longterm debt borrowings in 2015 to fund our acquisitions of brand aromatics da and stubb’s combined with the lower ebitda for 2015 special charges were 160 million 655 million and 52 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively those special charges reduced ebitda and accordingly increased the ratios of total debt to ebitda for 2016 2015 and 2014 shown in the preceding table by 003 016 and 001 respectively 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at november 30 2016 we temporarily used 2189 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2016 and 2015 were 6038 million and 5460 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2016 and 2015 was 16588 million and 15719 million respectively 

see notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets  – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities  – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in june 2015 we entered into a fiveyear 750 million revolving credit facility which will expire in june 2020 the pricing for this credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 075 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 1828 million as of november 30 2016 that will expire in 2017 we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 251 million in 2016 157 million in 2015 and 168 million in 2014 it is expected that the 2017 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 13 million primarily for international plans future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 65 of assets are invested in equities 26 in fixed income investments and 9 in other investments assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 50 in equities and 50 in fixed income investments see also note 10 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits 

on december 15 2016 after our fiscal year end we purchased 100 of the shares of enrico giotti spa giotti a leading european flavor manufacturer located in italy for a cash payment of 1255 million subject to certain postclosing adjustments the acquisition was funded with cash and shortterm borrowings giotti is well known in the industry for its innovative beverage sweet savory and dairy flavor applications our acquisition of giotti in fiscal 2017 expands the breadth of valueadded products for mccormicks industrial segment including additional expertise in flavoring health and nutrition products 

in fiscal year 2016 we made the following acquisitions 

 

in fiscal year 2015 we made the following acquisitions 

 see notes 2 and 19 of the financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht as well as the euro versus the british pound sterling australian dollar and swiss franc we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2016 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france the uk poland mexico canada and australia we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2016 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2016 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions

we had a number of smaller contracts at november 30 2016 with an aggregate notional value of 234 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc and the thai baht the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 04 million at november 30 2016 

included in the table are 1894 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than seven days that are used to hedge shortterm cash flow funding remaining contracts have durations of one to 12 months

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2016 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

years of maturity at november 30 2016 



the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects 

 commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2016 our most significant raw materials were pepper dairy products capsicums red peppers and paprika garlic onion rice wheat flour and vanilla while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2016 

contractual cash obligations due by year 







2017 changes in the fair value of this liability including any increase or decrease to our estimate of the ultimate payout determined under the contractual provisions and accretion of interest on the discounted liability will occur prior to the ultimate payment in 2018 

 

the contractual cash obligations table above does not reflect any estimated lease payment obligation with respect to a 15year lease for a headquarters building in hunt valley maryland which was entered into in july 2016 the lease which is expected to commence upon completion of building construction and fitout currently scheduled for the second half of 2018 will require monthly lease payments of approximately 09 million beginning six months after lease commencement that monthly lease payment is subject to adjustment after an initial 60month period and thereafter on an annual basis as specified in the lease agreement in addition the initial 09 million monthly lease payment is subject to an increase in the event of agreedupon changes to specifications related to the headquarters building see note 6 of the financial statements for additional details 

pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2016 and 2015 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue 

growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2016 we had 17714 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 16083 million in the consumer segment and 1631 million in the industrial segment our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a relieffromroyalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

as of november 30 2016 we had 3122 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values excluding i the kohinoor brand name that was written down to its estimated fair value in the third quarter of 2015 ii the brand names associated with brand aromatics da and stubbs that had their fair value brand valuations finalized during fiscal 2016 and iii the gourmet garden brand name preliminarily determined in fiscal 2016 the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value of our major brand names and trademarks is 40 or more as of november 30 2016 

below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2016 



a book value for the gourmet garden brand name as of november 30 2016 is based on a preliminary valuation and will be adjusted upon finalization of this valuation in 2017 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the 

need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2017 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 14 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2017 pension expense by approximately 8 million 

assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize 

in 2014 the society of actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables resulting from studies they conducted that measured mortality rates for various groups of individuals and mortality information from the social security administration the updated mortality tables released by the society of actuaries in 2014 reflected improved trends in longevity and therefore increased the estimate of benefits to be received by plan participants in 2015 the society of actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables that reflected updated social security administration data and that reflected smaller improvements in longevity than its 2014 mortality tables 

in determining the mortality assumptions for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have considered the updated mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries in 2014 and 2015 coupled with other mortality information from the social security administration and from our consulting actuaries that we believe is more closely aligned with our industry and participant mix to develop assumptions that we believe are most representative of the characteristics of our participant populations our use of these updated mortality assumptions increased pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 2 million in 2015 based on our evaluation as of november 30 2015 in conjunction with advice from our consulting actuaries we determined that no further change was required to our mortality assumptions in 2015 other than the following refinement with respect to our us other postretirement benefit plan in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our us other postretirement benefit plans at november 30 2015 we modified those mortality assumptions to reflect a headcountweighted version of such assumptions that we believe is most representative of the characteristics of our other postretirement benefits population the effect of this modification decreased the benefit obligation for our us other postretirement benefit plan by approximately 17 million and had an immaterial effect on our related 2016 expense based on our evaluation as of november 30 2016 in conjunction with advice from our consulting actuaries we have updated the mortality improvement scale for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans to reflect actual data from the social security administration through 2013 the effect of this modification decreased the benefit obligation for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 26 million and will have an immaterial effect on our related 2017 expense 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in addition see note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements

our industrial segment has a number of competitors some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach other competitors include larger publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature but which also tend to specialize in a narrower range of flavor solutions than mccormick 

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are pepper dairy products capsicums red peppers and paprika rice onion wheat flour and garlic pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced from within the us and locally for many of our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program 

customers

we also own various patents none of which are individually material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis” 

competition 

each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive in this competitive environment our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights additionally in the consumer segment we are building brand recognition and loyalty through increased advertising and promotions 

research and development 

many of our products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by our research laboratories and product development teams and in some cases customer proprietary formulas expenditures for research and development were 608 million in 2015 620 million in 2014 and 613 million in 2013 the amount spent on customersponsored research activities is not material 

governmental regulation

environmental regulations

employees 

we had approximately 10000 fulltime employees worldwide as of november 30 2015 our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages and in the opinion of management employee relations are good we have no collective bargaining contracts in the united states at our foreign subsidiaries approximately 1700 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves risks including the risks described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products if a significant portion of our branded business 

was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing and their response to those changes could impact our business our industrial segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial segment declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 22 of our consolidated sales in 2015 the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper dairy products capsicums red peppers and paprika rice onion wheat flour and garlic while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this 

risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacture storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification the import and export of products and product ingredients employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2015 43 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties beginning in 2011 several countries within the european union experienced sovereign debt and credit issues this has caused more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee thai baht and swiss franc as well as the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 140 million at an average interest rate of approximately 22 on november 30 2015 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently we rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control including those involving cyber attacks using viruses worms or other destructive software process breakdowns or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing such breaches could result in unauthorized access to information including customer consumer or other company confidential data we invest in security technology and design our business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches while we believe these measures are generally effective there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur moreover the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which has been material to us to date however a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation regulatory enforcement proceedings and direct costs associated with incident response 

the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing 

facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products in addition such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

during the last three years we implemented changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future as a result of such fixed cost reductions and process simplifications or improvements we may from time to time transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another or eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program or other similar 

programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase operating income 7 to 9 and increase earnings per share 9 to 11 over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support customer intimacy and category growth 2 product innovation and 3 acquisitions we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

our business generates strong cash flow and we have a balanced use of cash we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 30 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases each year we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2015 we continued to grow our business although sales and earnings were unfavorably impacted by the strength of the us dollar and the resultant unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange as compared to 2014 net sales rose 1 over the 2014 level as a result of the following factors 

 operating income was 5484 million in 2015 and 6030 million in 2014 excluding special charges adjusted operating income rose to 6139 million from 6082 million in 2014 or an increase of 1 as with net sales unfavorable currency exchange lowered this growth rate with an impact of 4 for further details and a reconciliation of nongaap to reported amounts see nongaap financial measures excluding this impact the increase in adjusted operating income compared to the prior year would have been 5 this was below our longterm objective due in part to higher material costs and higher employee benefit expense in 2015 as compared to the 

prior year as well as an increase in brand marketing diluted earnings per share was 311 in 2015 and 334 in 2014 excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges adjusted diluted earnings per share was 348 in 2015 an increase of 3 over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 337 in 2014 this growth rate reflected the increase in adjusted operating income higher income from unconsolidated operations and the impact of our share repurchases the unfavorable currency exchange rates had an adverse impact on the increase in adjusted operating income as previously described as well as on income from unconsolidated operations 

mccormick continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 5900 million in 2015 an increase from 5036 million in 2014 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2015 that return of cash to our shareholders was 3507 million 

results of operations—2015 compared to 2014 



sales for the fiscal year 2015 increased by 13 from 2014 and included a 51 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis that is excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption nongaap financial measures our sales increased 64 over 2014 with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments higher volume and product mix added 39 to sales driven by product innovation brand marketing and expanded distribution including new retail channels and new geographic regions pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 11 to sales the incremental impact of the three acquisitions completed in 2015–brand aromatics drogheria  alimentari da and stubb’s–added 14 to sales 

in 2016 we expect to grow sales on a constant currency basis by 4 to 6 from 2015 driven by further increases in volume and product mix pricing actions to offset a projected increase in material costs and incremental sales from the acquisitions completed during 2015 we expect this range to be reduced as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 



in 2015 gross profit was comparable to 2014 gross profit margin declined 40 basis points from the 2014 level to 404 this decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the impact of a midsingle digit increase in material costs partially offset by cost savings and pricing actions in 2015 cci cost savings as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements totaled 98 million of which 66 million lowered cost of goods sold lower gross profit from our kohinoor business in india also impacted gross profit margin in 2015 and as a result toward the end of 2015 we decided to discontinue the lower margin bulkpackaged and broken rice product lines of our kohinoor business in 2016 we expect our pricing actions and cost savings to more than offset an estimated low singledigit increase in raw material and packaging costs 



selling general and administrative expenses were 11274 million in 2015 compared to 11220 million in 2014 an increase of 54 million sga as a percentage of net sales was 262 a 30 basis point reduction from 2014 driving this reduction in sga as a percentage of net sales were cost savings from cci and from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements as well as the benefit of higher sales partly 

offset by higher benefits expense and a 14 million increase in our brand marketing from the 2014 level to 2406 million in 2015 in connection with our acquisitions of brand aromatics da and stubb’s we incurred 36 million of transaction costs which were included in sga 



we are evaluating and implementing changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness special charges of 655 million were recorded in 2015 and 52 million in 2014 to enable us to implement these changes of the 655 million of special charges recorded in 2015 40 million were recorded in cost of goods sold of the 655 million 292 million related to employee severance and related costs associated with our north american effectiveness initiative and 244 million related to our emea reorganization initiated earlier in 2015 an additional 142 million related to our kohinoor consumer business in india partially offsetting these charges was a credit of 23 million for the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of special charges in 2014 and 2013 see note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges 

in 2014 we recorded special charges of 21 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in late 2013 13 million related to the realignment of certain manufacturing activities in the us industrial business 11 million related to the elimination of certain administrative positions in the us consumer and industrial businesses and 07 million related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in the australian consumer business 



interest expense for 2015 was higher than the prior year primarily due to higher average borrowings 



the effective tax rate increased 20 basis points to 265 in 2015 from 263 in 2014 primarily as a result of the following factors net discrete tax benefits increased by 83 million from 108 million in 2014 to 191 million in 2015 both 2015 and 2014 included reversals of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided for various income tax audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions in addition 2015 included a net discrete tax benefit for i the reversal of valuation allowances on nonus deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets and ii a prior year adjustment for the 2014 research tax credit related to legislation enacted in 2015 offset by iii a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the uk resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 which reduced the uk statutory tax rate in future periods the increase in net discrete tax benefits in 2015 as compared to 2014 was more than offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015 that unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015 as compared to the prior year resulted from the higher percentage of us pretax earnings in 2015 that are taxed at a federal statutory rate of 35 as well as an increase in nonus losses in jurisdictions where income tax benefits could not be recognized as it is more likely than not that the resultant deferred tax assets will not be realized see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 

we expect an effective tax rate in 2016 of approximately 28 



income from unconsolidated operations rose 73 million in 2015 from the prior year which was a 248 increase despite the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates this increase is attributable to our largest joint venture 

mccormick de mexico which achieved higher sales and an increase in gross margin percentage in 2015 our 50 interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 60 of the sales and 89 of the income of our unconsolidated operations we own 50 of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures 

in 2016 we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be comparable to 2015 mainly due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates and material costs on mccormick de mexico 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 311 in 2015 compared to 334 in 2014 the table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2014 to 2015 the increase in adjusted operating income and increase in income from unconsolidated operations in the table below reflect a significant impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2015 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment increased by 04 which included a 49 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates as compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis consumer sales increased by 53 in 2015 due to higher volume and product mix that added 38 to sales and higher pricing related to material cost changes that added 01 to sales our acquisitions of da and stubb’s during the second and third quarters respectively added 14 to sales in 2015 

in the americas consumer sales rose 18 in 2015 as compared to 2014 that increase included a 14 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis americas consumer sales increased by 32 which included 24 from higher volume and product mix and 05 from higher pricing higher volume and product mix was led by us sales growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes this is an improvement over the 2014 sales results and is being driven by product innovation brand marketing particularly in digital and working with retailers on instore product assortment pricing and promotion the acquisition of stubb’s which closed in august 2015 added 03 to sales in 2015 

in the emea region consumer sales decreased 50 as compared to 2014 however that decrease included an unfavorable impact of 153 from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis emea consumer sales increased by 103 which included 47 from higher volume and product mix and 03 from higher pricing the acquisition of da which closed in may 2015 added 53 to sales in 2015 our core business growth in the emea region was led by poland france and russia and driven by our higher brand marketing new product innovation and expanded distribution 

in the asiapacific region consumer sales increased 26 as compared to 2014 that increase included an unfavorable impact of 40 from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis asiapacific consumer sales increased by 66 which included 83 from higher volume and product mix partly offset by a 17 reduction from pricing in 2015 constant currency sales in both china and australia increased at a doubledigit rate due in part to expanded distribution while sales in india declined due in part to the discontinuation of lowermargin bulkpackaged and broken rice product lines as well as lower pricing on basmati rice 

operating income excluding special charges for our consumer segment decreased 182 million or 38 compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis operating income for 2015 excluding special charges decreased 04 with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings offset by the unfavorable impact of higher material costs increased employee benefit expense and a 4 increase in brand marketing the decrease in operating income led to lower operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges the consumer segment operating income margin was 173 in 2015 and 181 in 2014 

industrial segment 



sales of our industrial segment increased by 27 which included a 55 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates as compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis industrial sales increased by 82 in 2015 due to higher volume and product mix that added 43 to sales and higher pricing related to material cost changes that added 26 to sales our acquisition of brand aromatics in the second quarter added 13 to sales in 2015 

in the americas industrial sales rose 32 in 2015 as compared to 2014 that increase included a 32 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis americas industrial sales increased by 64 which included 13 from higher volume and product mix and 31 from higher pricing higher volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in both the us and mexico as well as branded food service products in the us the acquisition of brand aromatics which closed in march 2015 added 20 to industrial sales in the americas in 2015 

in the emea region industrial sales increased 08 as compared to 2014 that increase included an unfavorable impact of 118 from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis emea industrial sales increased by 126 which included 104 from higher volume and product mix and 22 from higher pricing the strong sales performance reflected our support for the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region 

in the asiapacific region industrial sales increased 29 as compared to 2014 that increase included an unfavorable impact of 73 from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis asiapacific industrial sales increased by 102 which included 99 from higher volume and product mix and 03 from pricing in 2015 we increased sales to quick service restaurant customers in china and other markets across this region 

operating income excluding special charges for our industrial segment increased 239 million or 178 compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis operating income for 2015 excluding special charges increased 245 above 2014 with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and increased employee benefit expense the significant increase in operating income led to higher operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges the industrial segment 

operating income margin was 95 in 2015 and 83 in 2014 this also reflects a shift in the business mix to more valueadded products including the acquisition of brand aromatics 

results of operations—2014 compared to 2013 



sales for the fiscal year 2014 increased by 29 from 2013 and included a 06 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis our sales increased 35 over 2013 with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 19 to sales the incremental impact of the wuhan asia pacific condiments wapc acquisition completed in mid2013 accounted for a 18 increase to sales while volume and product mix in the base business reduced sales 02 



in 2014 gross profit increased 39 while gross profit margin rose 40 basis points over the 2013 level to 408 we offset a low singledigit increase in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings in 2014 cci cost savings totaled 65 million of which 54 million lowered cost of goods sold 



selling general and administrative expenses were 11220 million in 2014 compared to 10750 million in 2013 an increase of 470 million or 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales that 40 basis point increase was driven by an 188 million increase in our brand marketing support from the 2013 level to 2266 million in 2014 with 40 of that increase related to digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support in addition   compared to 2013 lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in 2014 were partially offset by increased employee incentive compensation expenses in 2014 



beginning in 2013 we evaluated and implemented changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness special charges of 52 million principally related to employee severance and related benefits were recorded in 2014 to enable us to implement these changes for 2013 we recorded 250 million of special charges with 159 million related to employee severance 64 million for asset writedowns and 27 million for other exit costs see note 3 of the financial statements for additional information 

in addition to the special charges outlined above we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of 153 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our us defined benefit obligation which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future the settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former us employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits this lump sum payout program was completed in 2013 see note 10 of the financial statements for additional information 



interest expense for 2014 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the refinancing of longterm debt in the second half of 2013 in august 2013 we issued 250 million of 350 notes at an effective interest rate of 330 the net cash proceeds of which plus cash on hand were used to pay off 250 million of 525 notes at an effective interest rate of 554 that matured in september 2013 



the effective tax rate declined 50 basis points to 263 in 2014 from 268 in 2013 primarily as a result of the following factors discrete tax benefits were 108 million in 2014 compared to 39 million in 2013 that increase in 2014 is primarily due to the reversal of previously established reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided upon the following tax settlements reached during 2014 1 a settlement with respect to the french taxing authority’s audits of the 20072013 tax years and 2 a settlement with respect to the internal revenue service irs examination of our us federal income tax return for the 2007 and 2008 tax years discrete tax benefits in 2013 of 39 million resulted from the 2013 recognition of a 2012 us research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses during 2013 a new law was enacted that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012 and allowed for a research tax credit in 2013 no research tax credit was recognized in 2014 as the tax law which retroactively granted the research tax credit for 2014 was not enacted until after the company’s 2014 fiscal year end see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations rose 62 million in 2014 compared to 2013 which was a 267 increase this increase was attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico which benefited in 2014 from its transition to a more efficient manufacturing facility and from lower commodity costs 

in 2014 our 50 interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 64 of the sales and 91 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 334 in 2014 compared to 291 in 2013 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2013 to 2014 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer segment 

  



sales of our consumer segment increased by 34 which included a 04 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates as compared to 2013 on a constant currency basis consumer sales increased by 38 in 2014 which included a 29 increase due to the mid2013 acquisition of wapc and a 20 increase due to higher pricing offset in part by a 11 decline in volume and product mix in 2014 from 2013 

in the americas consumer segment sales declined 07 in 2014 as compared to 2013 that decline included a 07 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis consumer sales in the americas approximated the prior year level as higher pricing added 16 to sales while a decline in volume and product mix reduced sales 16 in the latter part of 2013 our sales growth was hampered as smaller competitors gained category share this competitive activity persisted in 2014 throughout 2014 we had actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that included additional brand marketing support accelerated innovation and working with our retail customers to optimize their spices and seasonings and their recipe mix categories while simultaneously increasing sales of our products to these customers we made progress and gained category share in 2014 in recipe mixes driven in part by new grilling products glutenfree products and liquid skillet sauces in 2014 our category share of spices and seasonings had a further decline 

in emea consumer sales increased 33 in 2014 over the 2013 level with 15 added by favorable foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis consumer sales in emea increased by 18 as pricing increased sales by 20 while volume and product mix declined slightly reducing sales by 02 while we had success with new product introductions increased brand marketing and distribution gains economic conditions across the region remained challenging in this region higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products as well as digital marketing 

in 2014 as compared to 2013 consumer sales in the asiapacific region rose 312 which included unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that lowered sales 32 on a constant currency basis consumer sales in the asiapacific region increased by 344 our mid2013 acquisition of wapc added 282 to net sales pricing actions added 40 and base business volume and product mix added 22 we achieved a doubledigit increase in our base business volume and product mix in china however crop shortages of basmati rice led to another year of steep increases in cost and pricing of basmati rice in india during 2014 and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties 

operating income excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement for our consumer segment rose 04 to 4743 million from 4723 million in 2013 on a constant currency basis operating income excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement for our consumer segment increased 11 in 2014 over the prior year level higher sales and cci cost savings contributed to this profit growth but were partly offset by higher material costs and a 168 million increase in brand marketing support operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement was 181 in 2014 compared to 186 in 2013 this reduction was due in part to the higher brand marketing support and the mix of business across regions as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

industrial segment 

  



sales of our industrial segment increased by 20 which included a 07 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates as compared to 2013 on a constant currency basis industrial sales increased by 27 in 2014 as pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 18 and volume and product mix added 09 the growth in volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in the americas and sales to quick service restaurants in our emea region 

in the americas industrial sales rose 04 which included a 09 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis industrial sales in the americas rose by 13 over 2013 as pricing added 10 and volume and product mix added 03 innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and we also grew sales of branded foodservice items in 2014 however demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the us in 2014 

in emea we grew industrial sales 93 which included a 11 favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis industrial sales in emea increased by 82 over the prior year with a 50 increase from pricing actions and a 32 increase in volume and product mix demand from quick service restaurants remained robust and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa 

in the asiapacific region industrial sales declined by 05 from the 2013 level that decline included a 24 unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis industrial sales in the asiapacific region rose by 19 in 2014 as pricing actions added 10 and higher volume and product mix added 09 sales to quick service restaurants in china were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding quality issues from a supplier of protein in 2014 and regarding avian flu in 2013 

operating income excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement for our industrial segment was 1339 million in 2014 compared to 1185 million in 2013 on a constant currency basis operating income excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement for our industrial segment increased 134 in 2014 as compared to the prior year the increase from higher sales the benefit of cci cost savings and a more favorable mix of business was partly offset by increased material costs and a 20 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items industrial segment operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement was 83 in 2014 compared to 75 in 2013 

nongaap financial measures 

the tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income adjusted income from unconsolidated operations adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share each excluding the impact of special charges in 2015 2014 and 2013 and loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013 these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles in our consolidated income statement we include a separate line item captioned “special charges” in arriving at our consolidated operating income additionally we recorded 40 million in cost of goods sold in our income statement for the twelve months ended november 30 2015 which we classified as special charges special charges consist of expenses including related impairment 

charges associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both upfront costs and organizationalstructural impact to require advance approval by our management committee comprised of our chairman and chief executive officer president and chief operating officer executive vice president and chief financial officer president global industrial segment and mccormick international president global consumer segment and north america and senior vice president human relations upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a noncash component such as an asset impairment or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold impacted employees or operations expected timing and expected savings to the management committee and the committee’s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion details with respect to the composition of special charges recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements 

we believe these nongaap financial measures are important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

special charges of 655 million were recorded in 2015 to enable us to implement changes to our organization structure in order to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness of the 655 million of special charges recorded in 2015 292 million related to our north american effectiveness initiative 244 million related to streamlining actions in our europe middle east and africa emea region and 142 million related to our kohinoor business in india partially offsetting these charges was a reduction of 23 million associated with the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of actions undertaken in 2013 and 2014 

in 2014 we recorded special charges of 52 million of the 52 million of special charges recorded in 2014 21 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in 2013 13 million related to the realignment of manufacturing activities in the us industrial business and 11 million and 07 million related to the elimination of administrative andor manufacturing positions in the consumer and industrial businesses in the us and australia respectively 

in 2013 we recorded 250 million of special charges related to reorganization activities in the emea region and 153 million of loss on voluntary pension settlement related to our us pension plan for a lump sum distribution to former employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits 

we are treating these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as adjustments to our operating income income from unconsolidated operations net income and diluted earnings per share we are providing nongaap results that exclude the impact of these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as it allows for a better comparison of 2015 financial results to 2014 and 2013 see notes 3 and 10 of the financial statements for additional information on the special charges and the loss on voluntary pension settlement respectively 

these nongaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 



1 represents the portion of the kohinoor total special charge of 142 million attributable to kohinoors 15 minority stakeholder 

2 total special charges of 655 million for 2015 and 52 million for 2014 are net of taxes of 156 million and 15 million respectively total special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement for 2013 of 403 million are net of taxes of 111 million 

percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year the tables set forth below present constant currency net sales and operating income growth as follows 1 to present constant currency net sales and operating income growth for 2015 net sales and operating income for the year ended november 30 2015 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for the year ended november 30 2014 and compared to the reported results for the year ended november 30 2014 and 2 to present constant currency net sales and operating income growth for 2014 net sales and operating income for the year ended november 30 2014 for entities reporting in currencies other than the us dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for year ended november 30 2013 and compared to the reported results for the year ended november 30 2013 





in addition to the above nongaap measures we use total debt to adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as a measure of leverage we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses of interest income taxes depreciation and amortization special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement adjusted ebitda and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda are both nongaap financial measures this ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations our target for total debt to adjusted ebitda is 15 to 18 our total debt to adjusted ebitda can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity we believe that total debt to adjusted ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to adjusted ebitda 

 the following table reconciles our adjusted ebitda to our net income 



  

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate in 2016 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions with cash flow from operations 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2015 the exchange rate for substantially all foreign currencies including the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar and chinese renminbi were lower versus the us dollar than at november 30 2014 

operating cash flow –  operating cash flow was 5900 million in 2015 5036 million in 2014 and 4652 million in 2013 the variability in cash flow from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 is primarily attributable to improvements in the three main components of working capital the change in accounts payable was a source of cash in 2015 compared to a use of cash in 2014 and a modest source of cash in 2013 the change in accounts receivable was also a source of cash in 2015 but a use of cash in 2014 and 2013 the change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations as it was a less significant use of cash in 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2013 dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates were higher in 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2013 as well as in 2014 when compared to 2013 contributing to the increased cash flow from operations in 2015 and 2014 higher adjusted net income in 2015 compared to 2014 and in 2014 compared to 2013 contributed 79 million and 234 million to net cash flow from operating activities in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decrease in ccc in 2015 from 2014 is mainly due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding resulting from new contractual terms with a strategic customer the increase in ccc in 2014 from 2013 is mainly due to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of increased strategic raw material inventory 

investing cash flow –  net cash used in investing activities was 3389 million in 2015 1316 million in 2014 and 2397 million in 2013 the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses which amounted to 2109 million in 2015 and 1423 million in 2013 we did not make any acquisitions in 2014 see note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to the 2015 and 2013 acquisitions capital expenditures were 1284 million in 2015 1327 million in 2014 and 999 million in 2013 we expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between 150 million and 160 million 

financing cash flow –  net cash used in financing activities was 1996 million in 2015 3489 million in 2014 and 2459 million in 2013 the variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase and dividend activity described below and of changes in our net borrowing activity in 2015 2014 and 2013 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 1180 million 561 million and 667 million respectively in 2015 we received net cash proceeds of 2465 million from our issuance of 250 million of 325 notes due 2025 the net proceeds from this offering were used to pay down shortterm borrowings and for general corporate purposes in december 2015 proceeds from shortterm borrowings were used to pay off 200 million of 520 notes that matured in december 2015 in 2013 we received net cash proceeds of 2462 million from our issuance of 250 million of 350 notes due 2023 we used these net proceeds together with cash on hand to repay 250 million of maturing 525 notes and 14 million of other longterm debt and we increased our net shortterm borrowings by 719 million in 2013 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs 



as of november 30 2015 570 million remained of a 600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in march 2015 during the fourth quarter of 2015 we completed a previous 400 million share repurchase program that had been authorized in april 2013 

the common stock issued in 2015 2014 and 2013 relates to our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2015 the board of directors approved a 75 increase in the quarterly dividend from 040 to 043 per share 



the increase in our total debt to adjusted ebitda from 2014 to 2015 is mainly due to higher longterm debt borrowings in 2015 to fund our acquisitions of brand aromatics da and stubb’s excluding the impact of special charges adjusted ebitda for 2015 was 7556 million and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda was 185 the 

increase in our total debt to adjusted ebitda from 2013 to 2014 is mainly due to higher shortterm borrowings to fund strategic purchases of inventory 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at november 30 2015 we temporarily used 1717 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2015 and 2014 were 5460 million and 4237 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2015 and 2014 was 15719 million and 14287 million respectively 

during the year ended november 30 2015 we entered into a total of 100 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in november 2015 we cash settled all of these agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges for a loss of 12 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an allin effective fixed rate of 345 on the full 250 million of debt the loss on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to increase interest expense over the life of the notes hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements is not material 

in november 2015 we entered into an interest rate swap contract for a notional amount of 100 million to receive interest at 325 and pay a variable rate of interest based on threemonth libor plus 122 we designated these swaps which expire in november 2025 as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of 100 million of the 250 million 325 mediumterm notes due 2025 that we issued in november 2015 any unrealized gain or loss on these swaps will be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the value of the hedged debt hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements is not material 

in november 2012 and in april and august 2013 we entered into a total of 175 million of forwardstarting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in august 2013 we cash settled all of these agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges for a gain of 90 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an allin effective fixed rate of 330 on the full 250 million of debt the gain on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to reduce interest expense over the life of the notes hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements is not material 

see notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets – the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

in june 2015 we entered into a fiveyear 750 million revolving credit facility which will expire in june 2020 the pricing for this credit facility on a fully drawn basis is libor plus 075 this credit facility replaces our 600 million revolving credit facility which was due to expire in june 2016 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 154  0 million as of november 30 2015 that will expire in 2016 we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 157 million in 2015 168 million in 2014 and 427 million in 2013 it is expected that the 2016 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 16 million primarily for international plans future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 64 of assets are invested in equities 26 in fixed income investments and 10 in other investments assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of 50 in equities and 50 in fixed income investments see also note 10 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits 

in 2015 we made the following acquisitions 

 see note 2 of the financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions 

performance graph—shareholder return 

the following line graph compares the yearly change in mccormick’s cumulative total shareholder return stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends on mccormick’s nonvoting common stock with 1 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s 500 stock price index assuming reinvestment of dividends and 2 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s packaged foods  meats index assuming reinvestment of dividends 

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee thai baht and swiss franc as well as the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2015 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france the uk poland canada and australia we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2015 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2015 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2015 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

year of maturity at november 30 2015 



the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 520 notes due in december 2015 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015 net interest payments were based on 3 month libor minus 005 during this period we issued 250 million of 575 notes due in december 2017 in december 2007 forward treasury lock agreements of 150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 625 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due in 2021 in july 2011 forward treasury lock agreements of 200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 401 we issued 250 million of 350 notes due in 2023 in august 2013 forward treasury lock agreements of 175 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 330 we issued 250 million of 325 notes due in 2025 in november 2015 forward treasury lock agreements of 100 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 345 the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 325 notes due in december 2025 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025 net interest payments are based on 3 month libor plus 122 during this period 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2015 our most significant raw materials were pepper dairy products capsicums red peppers and paprika rice onion wheat flour and garlic while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future 

delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs discount chains and ecommerce this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2015 

contractual cash obligations due by year 





 pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2015 and 2014 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2015 we had 17593 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 15877 million in the consumer segment and 1716 million in the industrial segment our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a relieffromroyalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

in the third quarter of 2015 we recorded special charges related to initiatives to improve the profitability of our kohinoor consumer business in india this action principally relates to the discontinuance of kohinoors nonprofitable bulkpackaged and broken basmati rice product lines and other ancillary activities to enable the business to focus on both its existing consumerpackaged basmati rice product lines and the launch of consumerpackaged herbs and spices under the kohinoor brand name 

in light of the anticipated sales reduction associated with kohinoors discontinuance of its bulkpackaged and broken basmati rice product lines only partially offset by the launch of consumerpackaged herbs and spices we determined that an impairment of the kohinoor brand name had occurred using a relief from royalty method and a discount rate reflective of the risk associated with the launch of consumerpackaged herbs and spices a level 3 fair value measurement we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 96 million to write down the carrying value of our kohinoor brand name to its estimated fair value of 83 million see note 3 of our financial statements for additional information on this impairment charge 

as of november 30 2015 we had 2812 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values excluding the kohinoor brand name that was written down to its estimated fair value in the third quarter of 2015 and the brand names associated with brand aromatics drogheria  alimentari and stubbs that were recorded at fair value upon acquisition in fiscal 2015 the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value of our major brand names and trademarks ranges from a low of 40 to a high of over 90 

below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2015 



a book values for the stubbs and drogheria  alimentari brand names as of november 30 2015 are based on preliminary valuations and will be adjusted upon finalization of those valuations in 2016 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2016 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 16 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2016 pension expense by approximately 8 million 

assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize 

during 2014 the society of actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables resulting from recent studies conducted by them measuring mortality rates for various groups of individuals and mortality information from the social security administration through 2009 the updated mortality tables released by the society of actuaries in 2014 reflected improved trends in longevity and would therefore have had the effect of increasing the estimate of benefits to be received by plan participants during 2015 the society of actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables that reflected updated social security administration data from 2010 and 2011 and that reflected smaller improvements in longevity than its 2014 mortality tables 

in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at november 30 2014 we considered the updated mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries in 2014 coupled with other mortality information available from the social security administration including the 2010 and 2011 data previously referenced and from our consulting actuaries that we believe is more closely aligned with our industry and participant mix to develop assumptions that we believe are most representative of the various characteristics of our participant populations our use of these updated mortality assumptions during 2014 increased the benefit obligation for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 18 million at november 30 2014 and increased related pension and other postretirement benefit expense by approximately 2 million in 2015 based on our evaluation as of november 30 2015 in conjunction with advice from our consulting actuaries we determined that no further change was required to our mortality assumptions in 2015 other than the following refinement with respect to our us other postretirement benefit plan in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our us other postretirement benefit plan at november 30 2015 we modified those mortality assumptions to reflect a headcountweighted version of such assumptions that we believe is most representative of the characteristics of our other postretirement benefits population the effect of this modification decreased the benefit obligation for our us other postretirement benefit plan by approximately 17 million and will have an immaterial effect on our related 2016 expense 

we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in addition see note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used in our business are pepper dairy products rice capsicums red peppers and paprika onion garlic and wheat flour pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like dairy products and onion are primarily sourced from within the us and locally for many of our international locations because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control 

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program

we also own various patents none of which individually are material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in our business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis”

each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive in this competitive environment our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights additionally in the consumer segment we are building brand recognition and loyalty through increased advertising and promotions

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves risks including the risks described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products if a significant portion of our branded business 

was switched to private label or competitive products it could have a material negative impact on our consumer business 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and depending upon the significance of the affected product that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing and their response to those changes could impact our business our industrial business may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial business declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have a number of major customers including two large customers that in the aggregate constituted approximately 22 of our consolidated sales in 2014 the loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper dairy products rice capsicums red pepper and paprika onion garlic and wheat flour while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery customer price adjustments and cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement program we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this 

risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacture storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification the import and export of products and product ingredients employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses and raw material costs assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2014 approximately 45 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties beginning in 2011 several countries within the european union experienced sovereign debt and credit issues this has caused more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee thai baht and swiss franc as well as the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 270 million at an average interest rate of approximately 13 on november 30 2014 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently we rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control we invest in security technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber attacks while we believe these measures provide some protection against security breaches and mitigate cybersecurity risks there can be no assurance that security breaches and cyber attacks will not occur a breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation 

the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations 

during 2014 and 2013 we evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and we expect to continue such actions in the future as a result of such fixed cost reductions and process simplifications or improvements we may from time to time transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another or eliminate certain manufacturing selling and administrative positions these actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in mccormick 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report we use certain nongaap information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retail outlets food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase operating income 7 to 9 and increase earnings per share 9 to 11 over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support customer intimacy and category growth 2 product innovation and 3 acquisitions we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

our business generates strong cash flow and we have a balanced use of cash we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 29 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases each year we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2014 we grew net sales 3 with increases in both our consumer and industrial business this rate of growth was below our longterm goal as a result of challenging conditions in certain parts of our business in the us our consumer business was impacted by smaller competitors that have gained retail distribution we are addressing this competition through accelerated innovation increased brand marketing and the sharing of our analytics with retail customers to help optimize their sales and profitability while simultaneously increasing our sales to those customers in china our industrial business was impacted by weak demand from quick service restaurants that related to a product quality issue from a protein supplier we expect this situation to improve in 2015 as these quick service restaurants have addressed this issue and continue to invest in new restaurant locations in china operating income was 6030 million in 2014 excluding special charges and in 2013 a loss on a voluntary pension settlement adjusted operating income rose to 6082 million from 5908 million in 2013 this was an increase of 3 and below our longterm objective due in part to a significant increase in brand marketing support and a less favorable mix of business diluted earnings per share was 334 in 2014 excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement adjusted diluted earnings per share was 337 in 2014 an increase of approximately 8 over adjusted diluted earnings per share of 313 in 2013 this increase was mainly driven by higher adjusted operating income higher income from unconsolidated operations and our share repurchases 

mccormick continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 5036 million in 2014 an increase from 4652 million in 2013 we continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2014 that return of cash to our shareholders was a record 4367 million 

results of operations—2014 compared to 2013 



sales for the fiscal year 2014 rose 29 from 2013 with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 19 to sales the incremental impact of the wuhan asia pacific condiments wapc acquisition completed in mid2013 accounted for a 18 increase to sales while volume and product mix in the base business reduced sales 02 the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2014 reducing sales by 06 

in 2015 we expect to grow sales in local currency by 4 to 6 from 2014 to include the impact of higher volume and pricing we expect this range to be significantly reduced as a result of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 

in 2014 gross profit increased 39 while gross profit margin rose 40 basis points over the 2013 level to 408 we offset a low singledigit increase in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings our cci program generated cost savings of 65 million in 2014 of which 54 million lowered cost of goods sold in 2015 we expect a favorable impact from pricing actions and cost savings largely offset by a midsingle digit increase in raw material and packaging costs 



selling general and administrative expenses were 11220 million in 2014 compared to 10750 million in 2013 an increase of 470 million or 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales that 40 basis point increase was driven by an 188 million increase in our brand marketing support from the 2013 level to 2266 million in 2014 with 40 of that increase related to digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support in addition   compared to 2013 lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in 2014 were partially offset by increased employee incentive compensation expenses in 2014 



we are evaluating changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness special charges of 52 million were recorded in 2014 to enable us to implement these changes of the 52 million of special charges recorded in 2014 which were principally related to employee severance 21 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in late 2013 13 million related to the realignment of certain manufacturing activities in the us industrial business 11 million related to the elimination of certain administrative positions in the us consumer and industrial businesses and 07 million related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in the australian consumer business 

in late 2013 we announced several reorganization activities in the emea region to further improve emea’s profitability and process standardization while supporting its competitiveness and longterm growth at that time we indicated our expectation that we would recognize approximately 27 million of cash and noncash charges related to this plan of which 250 million in special charges was recognized in 2013 with 159 million related to 

employee severance 64 million for asset writedowns and 27 million for other exit costs total cash expenditures to implement this emea reorganization plan were 107 million in 2014 we expect to complete the implementation of this plan in 2015 spending an additional 10 million in cash in that year see note 3 of the financial statements for further information with respect to special charges recorded in 2014 and 2013 

in addition to the special charges outlined above we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of 153 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our us defined benefit obligation which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future the settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former us employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits this lump sum payout program was completed in 2013 see note 10 of the financial statements for additional information 



interest expense for 2014 was lower than the prior year primarily due to the refinancing of longterm debt in the second half of 2013 in august 2013 we issued 250 million of 350 notes at an effective interest rate of 330 the net cash proceeds of which plus cash on hand were used to pay off 250 million of 525 notes at an effective interest rate of 554 that matured in september 2013 



the effective tax rate declined 50 basis points to 263 in 2014 from 268 in 2013 primarily as a result of the following factors discrete tax benefits were 108 million in 2014 compared to 39 million in 2013 that increase in 2014 is primarily due to the reversal of previously established reserves for unrecognized tax benefits net of additional taxes provided upon the following tax settlements reached during 2014 1 a settlement with respect to the french taxing authority’s audits of the 20072013 tax years and 2 a settlement with respect to the internal revenue service irs examination of our us federal income tax return for the 2007 and 2008 tax years discrete tax benefits in 2013 of 39 million resulted from the 2013 recognition of a 2012 us research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses during 2013 a new law was enacted that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012 and allowed for a research tax credit in 2013 no research tax credit was recognized in 2014 as the tax law which retroactively granted the research tax credit for 2014 was not enacted until after the company’s 2014 fiscal year end see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate with the effective tax rate 

in november 2012 we deposited 188 million with the irs to stop any potential interest on proposed adjustments associated with the irs examination of our us federal income tax returns for the 2007 and 2008 tax years in november 2014 149 million of that deposit was refunded to us upon our settlement with the irs 

we expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to range from 27 to 28 



income from unconsolidated operations rose 62 million in 2014 compared to 2013 which was a 267 increase this increase is attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico which benefited in 2014 from its transition to a more efficient manufacturing facility and from lower commodity costs 

in 2014 our 50 interest in the mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 64 of the sales and 91 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures we own 50 of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 334 in 2014 compared to 291 in 2013 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2013 to 2014 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges and in 2013 the loss on voluntary pension settlement as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer business 

  



we grew sales in the consumer business 34 in 2014 from 2013 this growth rate included a 29 increase due to the mid2013 acquisition of wapc and a 20 increase due to higher price offset in part by a 11 decline in volume and product mix and 04 decline from unfavorable foreign exchange rates in 2014 from 2013 

in the americas consumer business sales declined 07 although higher pricing added 16 a decline in volume and product mix reduced sales 16 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales 07 in the latter part of 2013 our sales growth was hampered as smaller competitors gained category share this competitive activity persisted in 2014 throughout 2014 we had actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that included additional brand marketing support accelerated innovation and working with our retail customers to optimize their spices and seasonings and their recipe mix categories while simultaneously increasing sales of our products to these customers we are making progress and have gained category share in 2014 in recipe mixes driven in part by new grilling products glutenfree products and liquid skillet sauces in 2014 our category share of spices and seasonings had a further decline although we expect better results in 2015 as we continue with our actions to improve the performance of our consumer business in the americas 

in emea consumer business sales increased 33 with 20 added by pricing and 15 added by favorable foreign currency exchange rates volume and product mix declined slightly reducing sales by 02 while we had success with new product introductions increased brand marketing and distribution gains economic conditions across the region remained challenging our innovation activity in 2014 included the rollout of flavour shots in the uk dessert items in france and additional recipe mixes in poland in this region higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products as well as digital marketing 

in the asiapacific region sales rose 312 our mid2013 acquisition of wapc added 282 to net sales pricing actions added 40 and base business volume and product mix added 22 while unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates lowered sales 32 we achieved a doubledigit increase in our base business volume and product mix in china however crop shortages of basmati rice led to another year of steep increases in cost and pricing of basmati rice in india during 2014 and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties 

consumer business operating income excluding special charges and for 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement rose 04 to 4743 million from 4723 million in 2013 higher sales and cci cost savings contributed to this profit growth but were largely offset by higher material costs and a 168 million increase in brand marketing support operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement was 181 in 2014 compared to 186 in 2013 this reduction was due in part to the higher brand marketing support and the mix of business across regions as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

industrial business 

  



we grew sales for the industrial business 20 in 2014 pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 18 and volume and product mix added 09 unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 07 the growth in volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in the americas and sales to quick service restaurants in our emea region 

in the americas industrial business sales rose 04 pricing added 10 and volume and product mix added 03 to sales offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that lowered sales 09 innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and we also grew sales of branded foodservice items in 2014 however demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the us in 2014 this weakness is likely to extend into the first part of 2015 

in emea we grew industrial business sales 93 with a 50 increase from pricing actions a 32 increase in volume and product mix and a 11 increase from favorable foreign exchange rates demand from quick service restaurants remained robust and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa 

in the asiapacific region industrial business sales declined by 05 while pricing actions added 10 and higher volume and product mix added 09 unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales 24 sales to quick service restaurants in china were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding quality issues from a supplier of protein in 2014 and regarding avian flu in 2013 in 2015 we expect demand from these quick service restaurant customers to improve in china as they address these issues and continue to expand the number of restaurant locations 

industrial business operating income excluding special charges and for 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement was 1339 million compared to 1185 million in 2013 higher sales the benefit of cci cost savings and a more favorable mix of business more than offset increased material costs and a 20 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items industrial business operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement was 83 in 2014 compared to 75 in 2013 

results of operations—2013 compared to 2012 



sales for the fiscal year 2013 rose 27 from 2012 with growth in the consumer segment partially offset by a decline in the industrial segment pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 15 to sales the incremental impact of the wapc acquisition completed in mid2013 accounted for a 15 increase to sales and increased volume and product mix in the base business added 01 to sales the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2013 reducing sales by 04 



in 2013 gross profit increased 30 while gross profit margin rose 10 basis points we were able to offset the dollar impact of 3 inflation in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings in 2013 cci cost savings totaled 63 million of which 48 million lowered cost of goods sold 



selling general and administrative expenses were 10750 million in 2013 compared to 10395 million in 2012 an increase of 355 million or 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales retirement benefit expense increased 200 million in 2013 largely as a result of a lower interest rate environment at the november 30 2012 pension measurement date which negatively impacted 2013 expense of the increase in retirement benefit expense approximately 60 impacted selling general and administrative expenses in addition we increased our brand marketing support by 96 million to 2078 million in 2013 with about half of the increase in digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support 



in 2013 we announced several reorganization activities in the emea region and our expectation that we would record approximately 27 million of cash and noncash charges related to this plan for 2013 we recorded 250 million of special charges with 159 million related to employee severance 64 million for asset writedowns and 27 million for other exit costs we expect to complete the implementation of this plan in 2015 see note 3 of the financial statements for additional information 

in addition to the 250 million in special charges outlined above we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of 153 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our us defined benefit obligation which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future the settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former us employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits this lump sum payout program was completed in 2013 see note 10 of the financial statements for additional information 



interest expense for 2013 was lower than the prior year most of this decrease is due to the impact of lower average debt balances for 2013 compared to 2012 and was partially aided by slightly lower average interest rates in 2013 the higher average debt balances in 2012 were due to the acquisitions completed late in 2011 



discrete tax benefits in 2013 were 39 million compared to 20 million in 2012 the increase in 2013 was due to the 2013 recognition of a 2012 us research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses a new law was enacted in 2013 that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012 

tax expense for 2012 benefited from us foreign tax credits that reduced tax expense by 97 million due to the repatriation of 70 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries while no such benefit or repatriation occurred in 2013 tax expense in 2013 as a percentage of pretax income approximated the 2012 level due primarily to certain favorable items in 2013 which included the utilization of nonus operating losses lower state and local income taxes and the inclusion of the us research tax credit for 2013 as well as the increase in discrete tax benefits described above 

in addition see note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations increased 17 million in 2013 compared to 2012 most of this increase was attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico through strong sales growth along with improved performance by our eastern condiments joint venture in india 

in 2013 our mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 63 of the sales and 78 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 291 in 2013 compared to 304 in 2012 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2012 to 2013 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges and the loss on a voluntary pension settlement as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer business 

  



we grew sales in the consumer business 51 in 2013 from 2012 which included a 25 increase due to the mid2013 acquisition of wapc a 17 increase due to higher price and a 10 increase from higher volumes and improved product mix the effect of foreign exchange rates in 2013 from 2012 was slightly unfavorable reducing sales by 01 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 24 with volume and product mix adding 17 higher pricing adding 09 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates lowering sales by 02 higher volume and product mix was the result of new product introductions and increased brand marketing in 2013 our new product launches included grilling items premium recipe mixes authentic hispanic rice mixes and new varieties of lawry’s zatarains and simply asia brand products in the us in canada we had particular success with glutenfree gravy mixes introduced new grilling items and imported products from our business in china and affiliate in the philippines across the americas region a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was in support of our new products and seasonal events we also increased our digital marketing activity which offers a more personalized way to interact with consumers while we made good progress with these growth initiatives which contributed to strong consumer demand for spices and seasonings throughout 2013 our us sales slowed in the second half of the year during this period private label and smaller competitors gained category share in 2014 we had actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that include a significant increase in brand marketing support accelerated innovation and improved agility in the marketplace 

in emea consumer business sales increased 33 with pricing and favorable foreign currency exchange rates each adding 13 and higher volume and product mix adding 07 while we had success with new product introductions increased brand marketing and distribution gains economic conditions across the region remained challenging our innovation in 2013 included the development and introduction of recipe mixes in france and poland the launch of grilling items in a number of markets and new varieties of vahiné brand dessert items as in the americas higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products and towards digital marketing 

in the asiapacific region sales rose 326 the impact of our 2013 acquisition of wapc added 306 to net sales pricing added 100 base business volume and product mix declined 47 and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates lowered sales by 33 we achieved a doubledigit increase in our base business volume and product mix in china however crop shortages of basmati rice led to a steep increase in cost and pricing of basmati rice in india during 2013 and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties 

consumer business operating income excluding special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement rose to 4723 million from 4561 million in 2012 a 36 increase the growth in operating income was the result of higher sales and cci savings offset in part by higher retirement benefit expense a 69 million increase in brand marketing support 43 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of wapc and higher material costs operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement was 186 in 2013 compared to 189 in 2012 this reduction was due in part to the mix of business across regions as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

industrial business 

  



sales for the industrial business declined 08 in 2013 pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 12 while volume and product mix lowered sales by 12 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 08 the decline in volume and product mix was largely attributable to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the us and china in the us sales to quick service restaurants were impacted by lower restaurant traffic and customer emphasis on menu items for which mccormick is not a leading supplier in china consumer concerns including avian flu led to reduced demand for poultry throughout most of 2013 as a leading supplier of coatings and seasonings for chicken this adversely impacted our sales in 2013 

in the americas industrial business sales declined 17 while pricing added 12 to sales and favorable foreign currency exchange rates added 01 lower volume and product mix reduced sales 30 innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and sales of branded foodservice items were steady in 2013 however as indicated demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the us in 2013 

in emea industrial business sales rose 14 with a 39 increase in volume and product mix as well as a 20 increase from pricing actions these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced sales by 45 demand from quick service restaurants remained robust and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose slightly increasing by 02 higher volume and product mix added 06 and was largely offset by lower pricing of 01 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 03 product innovation in other parts of the region largely offset the weaker demand from quick service restaurants in china that was previously described by the end of our fiscal year 2013 the situation in china had improved 

industrial business operating income excluding special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement was 1185 million compared to 1222 million in 2012 the benefit of cci cost savings was more than offset by higher retirement benefit expense increased material costs and a 27 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items industrial business operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement was 75 in 2013 compared to 76 in 2012 

nongaap financial measures 

the tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share each excluding the impact of special charges in 2014 and 2013 and loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013 there were no adjustments to 2012 financial results these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we believe this nongaap information is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

special charges of 52 million were recorded in 2014 to enable us to implement changes to our organization structure in order to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness of the 52 million of special charges recorded in 2014 21 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the emea reorganization announced in 2013 13 million related to the realignment of manufacturing activities in the us industrial business and 11 million and 07 million related to the elimination of administrative andor manufacturing positions in the consumer and industrial businesses in the us and australia respectively 

in 2013 we recorded 250 million of special charges related to reorganization activities in the emea region and 153 million of loss on voluntary pension settlement related to our us pension plan for a lump sum distribution to former employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits 

we are treating these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as adjustments to our operating income net income and diluted earnings per share we are providing nongaap results that exclude the impact of these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as it allows for a better comparison of 2014 financial results to 2013 and 2012 see notes 3 and 10 of the financial statements for additional information on the special charges and the loss on voluntary pension settlement respectively 

these nongaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 



in addition to the above nongaap measures we use total debt to adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as a measure of leverage we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses of interest income taxes depreciation and amortization special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement adjusted ebitda and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda are both nongaap financial measures this ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations our target for total debt to adjusted ebitda excluding the temporary impact from acquisition activity is 15 to 18 we believe that total debt to adjusted ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to adjusted ebitda 

 the following table reconciles our adjusted ebitda to our net income 



  

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate in 2015 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions with cash flow from operations 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2014 the exchange rate for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty and australian dollar were lower versus the us dollar than at november 30 2013 

operating cash flow –  operating cash flow was 5036 million in 2014 4652 million in 2013 and 4550 million in 2012 the variability between years is due in part to changes in pension contributions which were 168 million in 2014 427 million in 2013 and 1043 million in 2012 these contributions include payments to unfunded plans we did not make any contribution to our major us pension plan in 2014 as the plan was already funded within our company funding guidelines the change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations as it was a use of cash in 2014 and 2013 and a modest source of cash in 2012 higher adjusted net income which excludes the impact of special charges in 2014 and 2013 and the loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013 in 2014 compared to 2013 and in 2013 compared to 2012 was also a factor in the increased cash flow from operations in 2014 and in 2013 respectively 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the increase in ccc from 2013 to 2014 is mainly due to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of increased strategic raw material inventory in the future we expect to reduce ccc by decreasing our days in inventory the increase in ccc from 2012 to 2013 is due to an increase in our days sales outstanding and a decrease in our days payable outstanding the increase in days sales outstanding was due in part to a greater customer response in 2013 to our us holiday display program which includes extended terms than in 2012 

investing cash flow –  net cash used in investing activities was 1316 million in 2014 2397 million in 2013 and 1090 million in 2012 the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses and joint venture interests which amounted to 1423 million in 2013 we did not make any acquisitions in either 2014 or 2012 see note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to the 2013 acquisition capital expenditures were 1327 million in 2014 999 million in 2013 and 1103 million in 2012 we expect 2015 capital expenditures to range between 130 million and 140 million 

financing cash flow –  net cash used in financing activities was 3489 million in 2014 2459 million in 2013 and 3243 million in 2012 the variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase and dividend activity described below and of changes in our net borrowing activity in 2014 and 2013 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 561 million and 667 million respectively in 2013 we received net cash proceeds of 2462 million from our issuance of 250 million of 350 notes due 2023 we used these net proceeds together with cash on hand to repay 250 million of maturing 525 notes and 14 million of other longterm debt and we increased our net shortterm borrowings by 719 million in 2013 in 2012 our net borrowing activity used cash of 805 million due principally to a 766 million net reduction in shortterm borrowings 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs in millions 



as of november 30 2014 116 million remained of a 400 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in april 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed a previous 400 million share repurchase program that had been authorized in june 2010 

the common stock issued in 2014 2013 and 2012 relates to our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2014 the board of directors approved an 81 increase in the quarterly dividend from 037 to 040 per share during the past five years dividends per share have risen at a compound annual rate of 90 



for 2014 our total debt has increased slightly over the prior year to bring the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda to 173 the increase was due to higher shortterm borrowings to fund strategic purchases of inventory 

the changes in our total debt to adjusted ebitda from 2012 to 2013 are mainly due to changes in our debt in conjunction with acquisition activity and the subsequent reduction of that debt in 2011 we increased our debt levels to help fund our kohinoor kamis and kitchen basics ®   acquisitions during 2012 the debt associated with these acquisitions was reduced to bring our total debt to adjusted ebitda within our target range of 15 to 18 for 2013 our ebitda is lower due to the impact of the special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement adjusted ebitda for 2013 was 7222 million and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda was 171 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at november 30 2014 we temporarily used 2014 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2014 and 2013 were 4237 million and 3907 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2014 and 2013 was 14287 million and 13957 million respectively 

in november 2012 and in april and august 2013 we entered into a total of 175 million of forwardstarting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in august 2013 we cash settled all of these agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges for a gain of 90 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an allin effective fixed rate of 330 on the full 250 million of debt the gain on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to reduce interest expense over the life of the notes hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements was not material 

see notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets –  global credit and capital markets continued to improve in 2014 the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth share repurchases dividends and capital expenditures we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

our major revolving credit facility has a total committed capacity of 600 million which expires in 2016 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 1254 million as of november 30 2014 that will expire in 2015 we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets and other investments – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 168 million in 2014 427 million in 2013 and 1043 million in 2012 our cash contributions in 2012 included a 35 million contribution made late in the fiscal year to bring the pension plans funding status within our company guidelines it is expected that the 2015 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 16 million primarily for international plans future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans approximately 66 of assets are invested in equities 25 in fixed income investments and 9 in other investments assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporateowned life insurance the value of which approximates an investment mix of approximately 50 in equities and 50 in fixed income investments see also note 10 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits we have a particular interest in emerging markets 

in 2013 we purchased the assets of wuhan asiapacific condiments co ltd wapc a privately held company based in china for 1448 million which included 1423 million of cash paid net of closing adjustments and the assumption of 25 million of liabilities the acquisition was financed with a combination of cash and debt wapc included in our consumer business segment manufactures and markets daqiao and chushile ®  brand bouillon products which have a leading position in the central region of china 

see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of this acquisition

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee thai baht and swiss franc as well as the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2014 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france the uk poland canada and australia we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2014 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2014 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2014 



we have a number of smaller contracts with an aggregate notional value of 127 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc and the thai baht as of november 30 2014 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 04 million at november 30 2014 

included in the table above are 1271 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than seven days that are used to hedge shortterm cash flow funding remaining contracts have durations of one to 12 months 

at november 30 2013 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and polish zloty with a notional value of 2049 million all of which matured in 2014 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 05 million at november 30 2013 

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2014 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

year of maturity at november 30 2014 



the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 520 notes due in december 2015 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015 net interest payments are based on 3 month libor minus 005 during this period we issued 250 million of 575 notes due in december 2017 in december 2007 forward treasury lock agreements of 150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 625 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due in 2021 in july 2011 forward treasury lock agreements of 200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 401 we issued 250 million of 350 notes due in 2023 in august 2013 forward treasury lock agreements of 175 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 330 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2014 our most significant raw materials were pepper dairy products rice capsicums red peppers and paprika onion garlic and wheat flour while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer business are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs and discount chains this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2014 and 2013 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expenses reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer business sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as 

sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2014 we had 17222 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 15811 million in the consumer segment and 1411 million in the industrial segment our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a relieffromroyalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset as of november 30 2014 we had 2708 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values at november 30 2014 the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value of our major brand names and trademarks ranges from a low of 8 to a high of over 70 while we believe that it is reasonably possible that in the event of an increase in discount rates andor a decline in forecasted revenues a noncash impairment charge may be required we do not believe that the amount of such an impairment charge would be significant at november 30 2014 a hypothetical 15 reduction in the calculated fair values of our major brand names and trademarks would result in an impairment charge for only one of our major brand names and trademarks and that impairment charge would be approximately 15 million we intend to continue to support our brand names and trademarks 

below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2014 



income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income 

taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2015 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 17 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2015 pension expense by approximately 8 million 

assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize during 2014 the society of actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables resulting from recent studies conducted by them measuring mortality rates for various groups of individuals the updated mortality tables released in 2014 reflect improved trends in longevity and therefore have the effect of increasing the estimate of benefits to be received by plan participants 

in determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at november 30 2014 we considered the updated mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries coupled with other mortality information available from the social security administration and our consulting actuaries that we believe is more closely aligned with our industry and participant mix to develop assumptions that we believe are most representative of the various characteristics of our participant populations 

the use of these updated mortality assumptions increased the benefit obligation for our us defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately 18 million at november 30 2014 and will have the effect of increasing related expense by approximately 2 million in 2015 we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension obligations in addition see the preceding sections of mda and note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in mccormick’s business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter mccormick usually builds its inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 of the financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis”

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves risks including the risks described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in private label use by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of branded and private label product offerings and consumers have the option to purchase private label products instead of branded products if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label it could have a material negative impact on our consumer business 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation 

we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us any of which could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall import alerts and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements even if the allegation is untrue a product recall import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients could result in our having to pay fines or damages incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients any of which could have a negative effect on our business and financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the rising popularity of social networking and other consumeroriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination whether or not accurate and as a result negative inaccurate or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands 

customer consolidation and competitive economic and other pressures facing our customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

a number of our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing and their response to those changes could impact our business our industrial business may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial business declines these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper dairy products rice capsicums red pepper and paprika onion garlic and soybean oil while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance 

and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing sourcing manufacture storage labeling marketing advertising and distribution of food products as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment competition anticorruption privacy relations with distributors and retailers foreign supplier verification the import and export of products and product ingredients employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results increased regulatory scrutiny of and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients for example proposition 65 the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 in california exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state if we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with proposition 65 the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operations major facilities or employees’ and customers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our 

financial results could be adversely affected additionally joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2013 approximately 40 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties beginning in 2011 several countries within the european union experienced sovereign debt and credit issues this has caused more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the british pound sterling versus the euro and the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 212 million at an average interest rate of approximately 07 on november 30 2013 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans liability due to a low interest rate environment could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby 

increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our operations may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack 

our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently we rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data communications supply chain order entry and fulfillment and other business processes the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers causing our business and results of operations to suffer 

furthermore our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control we invest in security technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber attacks while we believe these measures are adequate in preventing security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks and we have yet to experience any breach a breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation 

the global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate 

as a global business our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors including changes in tax 

legislation our global mix of earnings the tax characteristics of our income the timing and recognition of goodwill 

impairments acquisitions and dispositions adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the us and that will be taxable 

in addition significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported the positions are uncertain the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of tax audits case law and emerging legislation our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to the accruals including related interest and penalties as considered appropriate by management when particular matters arise a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

climate change may negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unseasonable or unusual weather or longterm climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices herbs and other raw materials there is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products 

our intellectual property rights and those of our customers could be infringed challenged or impaired and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers 

we possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers these intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas trademarks copyrights patents business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products our packaging the processes for their production and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses we protect our intellectual property rights and those of certain customers globally through a variety of means including trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets thirdparty assignments and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of thirdparty misuses of intellectual property if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

litigation legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

we are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection with such matters will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings in the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation that is material arises in the future there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings even if untrue may also adversely affect our reputation these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program our financial results could be negatively affected 

our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our cci program or other similar programs could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report the dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the mda are in millions except per share data 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retail outlets food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our longterm annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase operating income 7 to 9 and increase earnings per share 9 to 11 over time we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support expanded distribution and category growth 2 product innovation and 3 acquisitions we are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our comprehensive continuous improvement cci program an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization in addition to funding brand marketing support product innovation and other growth initiatives our cci program is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

our business generates strong cash flow and we have a balanced use of cash we are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends with annual increases in each of the past 28 years and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases each year we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

we grew net sales 3 in 2013 which was below our longterm objective of 4 to 6 while consumer business sales rose 5 as a result of an acquisition in china pricing actions product innovation and effective brand marketing sales declined 1 for our industrial business lower demand from quick service restaurants in the us and china more than offset higher sales in several developed markets and expansion in emerging markets operating income was 5505 million in 2013 excluding special charges of 250 million related to reorganization activities in the europe middle east and africa region emea and a 153 million loss on a voluntary pension settlement both of which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 adjusted operating income rose to 5908 million from 5783 million in 2012 this was an increase of 2 and below our longterm objective due in part to the lower rate of sales growth and a significant increase in retirement benefit expense these factors also impacted 2013 diluted earnings per share which was 291 excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2013 was 313 an increase of 3 from 304 diluted earnings per share in 2012 

mccormick continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached 4652 million in 2013 an increase from 4550 million in 2012 a lower contribution to pension plans in 2013 was offset in part by an increase in inventory largely as a result of strategic purchases and higher material costs we continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2013 that return of cash to our shareholders was a record 3573 million 

results of operations—2013 compared to 2012 



sales for the fiscal year 2013 rose 27 from 2012 with growth in the consumer segment partially offset by a decline in the industrial segment pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 15 to sales the incremental impact of the wapc acquisition completed in mid2013 accounted for a 

15 increase to sales and increased volume and product mix in the base business added 01 to sales the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2013 reducing sales by 04 

in 2014 we expect to grow sales in a 3 to 5 range from 2013 driven by higher volume pricing and the incremental impact in the first half of 2014 of the wapc acquisition 



in 2013 gross profit increased 30 while gross profit margin rose 10 basis points we were able to offset the dollar impact of 3 inflation in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings in 2013 cci cost savings totaled 63 million of which 48 million lowered cost of goods sold in 2014 we expect to improve in our gross profit margin by 50 to 100 basis points from 2013 due to cci cost savings together with a more favorable business mix 



selling general and administrative expenses were 10750 million in 2013 compared to 10395 million in 2012 an increase of 355 million or 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales retirement benefit expense increased 200 million in 2013 largely as a result of a lower interest rate environment at the november 30 2012 pension measurement date which negatively impacted 2013 expense of the increase in retirement benefit expense approximately 60 impacted selling general and administrative expenses in addition we increased our brand marketing support by 96 million to 2078 million in 2013 with about half of the increase in digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support 



in 2013 we announced several reorganization activities in the emea region we expect to record approximately 27 million of cash and noncash charges related to this plan for 2013 we recorded 250 million of special charges with 159 million related to employee severance 64 million for asset writedowns and 27 million for other exit costs we expect to record approximately 2 million of additional special charges related to this plan in 2014 total cash expenditures to implement the plan are expected to occur in 2014 and are estimated to be approximately 18 million we expect to complete the implementation of this plan by 2015 see note 3 of the financial statements for additional information 

in addition to the 250 million in special charges outlined above we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of 153 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our us defined benefit obligation which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future the settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former us employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits this lump sum payout program was completed in 2013 see note 9 of the financial statements for additional information 



interest expense for 2013 was lower than the prior year most of this decrease is due to the impact of lower average debt balances for 2013 compared to 2012 and was partially aided by slightly lower average interest rates in 2013 the higher average debt balances in 2012 were due to the acquisitions completed late in 2011 



discrete tax benefits in 2013 were 39 million compared to 20 million in 2012 the increase in 2013 is due to the 2013 recognition of a 2012 us research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses a new law was enacted in 2013 that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012 

tax expense for 2012 benefited from us foreign tax credits that reduced tax expense by 97 million due to the repatriation of 70 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries while no such benefit or repatriation occurred in 2013 tax expense in 2013 as a percentage of pretax income approximated the 2012 level due primarily to certain favorable items in 2013 which included the utilization of nonus operating losses lower state and local income taxes and the inclusion of the us research tax credit for 2013 as well as the increase in discrete tax benefits described above    

in 2010 the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of our us federal income tax return for the 2007 and 2008 tax years during the course of the examination we have held discussions with the irs on certain issues and in october 2012 we received proposed adjustments for these tax years in november 2012 we deposited 188 million with the irs to stop any potential interest on these proposed adjustments we disagree with certain of the proposed adjustments and in december 2012 we filed a protest to initiate the irs administrative appeals process no further significant events occurred in 2013 we believe we have established appropriate tax accruals under us gaap for these issues 

in addition see note 11 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 

we expect the tax rate in 2014 to increase from 2013 as a result of the discontinuation of the rd tax credit a tax law change in france and the expected mix of business across tax jurisdictions in addition we are comparing to the 2013 rate that included 39 million of discrete items 



income from unconsolidated operations increased 17 million in 2013 compared to 2012 most of this increase is attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico through strong sales growth along with improved performance by our eastern condiments joint venture in india 

in 2013 our mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 63 of the sales and 78 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures we own 50 of our other unconsolidated joint ventures except for a 26 share in our eastern condiments joint venture 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 291 in 2013 compared to 304 in 2012 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2012 to 2013 



we measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges and the loss on a voluntary pension settlement as these activities are managed separately from the business segments 

consumer business 

  



we grew sales in the consumer business 51 in 2013 from 2012 which included a 25 increase due to the mid2013 acquisition of wapc a 17 increase due to higher price and a 10 increase from higher volumes and improved product mix the effect of foreign exchange rates in 2013 from 2012 was slightly unfavorable reducing sales by 01 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 24 with volume and product mix adding 17 higher pricing adding 09 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates lowering sales by 02 higher volume and product mix was the result of new product introductions and increased brand marketing in 2013 our new product launches included grilling items premium recipe mixes authentic hispanic rice mixes and new varieties of lawry’s zatarains and simply asia brand products in the us in canada we had particular success with glutenfree gravy mixes introduced new grilling items and imported products from our business in china and affiliate in the philippines across the americas region a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was in support of our new products and seasonal events we also increased our digital marketing activity which offers a more personalized way to interact with consumers while we made good progress with these growth initiatives which contributed to strong consumer demand for spices and seasonings throughout 2013 our us sales slowed in the second half of the year during this period private label and smaller competitors gained category share in 2014 we have actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that include a significant increase in brand marketing support accelerated innovation and improved agility in the marketplace 

in emea consumer business sales increased 33 with pricing and favorable foreign currency exchange rates each adding 13 and higher volume and product mix adding 07 while we had success with new product introductions increased brand marketing and distribution gains economic conditions across the region remained challenging our innovation in 2013 included the development and introduction of recipe mixes in france and poland the launch of grilling items in a number of markets and new varieties of vahiné brand dessert items as in the americas higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products and towards digital marketing 

in the asiapacific region sales rose 326 the impact of our 2013 acquisition of wapc added 306 to net sales pricing added 100 base business volume and product mix declined 47 and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates lowered sales by 33 we achieved a doubledigit increase in our base business volume and product mix in china however crop shortages of basmati rice led to a steep increase in cost and pricing of basmati rice in india during 2013 and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties 

consumer business operating income excluding special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement rose to 4723 million from 4561 million in 2012 a 36 increase the growth in operating income was the result of higher sales and cci savings offset in part by higher retirement benefit expense a 69 million increase in brand marketing support 43 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of wapc and higher material costs operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement was 186 in 2013 compared to 189 in 2012 this reduction was due in part to the mix of business across regions as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

industrial business 

  



sales for the industrial business declined 08 in 2013 pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 12 while volume and product mix lowered sales by 12 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 08 the decline in volume and product mix was largely attributable to weak demand from quick service restaurants in the us and china in the us sales to quick service restaurants were impacted by lower restaurant traffic and customer emphasis on menu items for which mccormick is not a leading supplier in china consumer concerns including avian flu led to reduced demand for poultry throughout most of 2013 as a leading supplier of coatings and seasonings for chicken this adversely impacted our sales in 2013 

in the americas industrial business sales declined 17 while pricing added 12 to sales and favorable foreign currency exchange rates added 01 lower volume and product mix reduced sales 30 innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and sales of branded foodservice items were steady in 2013 however as indicated demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the us this period this weakness is expected to extend into the first part of 2014 

in emea industrial business sales rose 14 with a 39 increase in volume and product mix as well as a 20 increase from pricing actions these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced sales by 45 demand from quick service restaurants remained robust and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose slightly increasing by 02 higher volume and product mix added 06 and was largely offset by lower pricing of 01 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 03 product innovation in other parts of the region largely offset the weaker demand from quick service restaurants in china that was described above by yearend the situation in china had improved and further improvement is expected in 2014 

industrial business operating income excluding special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement was 1185 million compared to 1222 million in 2012 the benefit of cci cost savings was more than offset by higher retirement benefit expense increased material costs and a 27 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items industrial business operating income margin excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement was 75 in 2013 compared to 76 in 2012 

results of operations—2012 compared to 2011 



sales for 2012 rose 86 from 2011 with strong growth in both of our consumer and industrial businesses pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 44 to sales the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 accounted for a 43 increase to sales and increased volume and product mix in the base business added 14 to sales the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2012 reducing sales 15 



in 2012 gross profit increased 63 however our gross profit margin declined 90 basis points in 2012 we were able to offset the dollar impact of a high single digit increase in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings in 2012 cci cost savings totaled 56 million of which 39 million lowered cost of goods sold while pricing and cci cost savings offset the dollar impact of increased material costs the net impact of these factors caused downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of net sales margins were further pressured by our mix of sales in 2012 as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our gross profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 



selling general and administrative expenses increased 58 in 2012 from 2011 but decreased as a percentage of net sales for those same time periods the decrease in sga as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by a leveraging effect of our higher sales on these costs we had a benefit from cci cost savings that lowered sga 17 million in 2012 and a favorable comparison to 2011 when sga included 109 million of transaction costs related to completed acquisitions while 2012 had only 17 million of such costs 

during 2012 we increased brand marketing support by 110 million from 2011 levels to 1983 million a large portion of this increase was in digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support 



interest expense for 2012 was higher than the prior year the impact of higher average debt balances in 2012 compared to 2011 was partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates for 2012 compared to 2011 the higher average debt balances in 2012 were due to the acquisitions completed late in 2011 



in 2012 we repatriated 700 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries this transaction generated us foreign tax credits due to the mix of foreign earnings that related to this cash these us foreign tax credits reduced 2012 tax expense by 97 million and were the major driving factor in a reduction in the tax rate for 2012 as compared to the prior year 

discrete tax benefits in 2012 were 20 million compared to 08 million in 2011 the increase in 2012 is mainly due to the reversal of a portion of a valuation allowance originally established against a subsidiarys net operating losses this subsidiary has established a pattern of profitability which resulted in us concluding that a portion of the valuation allowance should be reversed 

in addition see note 11 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 39 million in 2012 compared to 2011 most of this decrease was attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico which was negatively impacted by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate between the mexican peso and the us dollar for most of 2012 while this business grew sales 6 profits were also pressured by higher soybean oil cost a main ingredient for mayonnaise which is the leading product for this joint venture this situation began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and by the fourth quarter of 2012 the yearonyear impact had eased 

in 2012 our mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 59 of the sales and 82 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures we own a 26 share in our eastern condiments joint venture and on average own 50 of our other unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 304 in 2012 compared to 279 in 2011 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2011 to 2012 



consumer business 

  



we grew consumer business sales 98 in 2012 when compared to 2011 which included a 72 increase from acquisitions completed in 2011 the remaining increase was driven by higher pricing which added 37 and volume and product mix which added 03 unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales by 14 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 40 primarily as a result of pricing actions which added 45 these pricing actions taken in response to an increase in material costs went into effect late in fiscal year 2011 our 2011 acquisition of kitchen basics ®  added 08 to sales volume and product mix reduced sales by 11 and foreign exchange rates reduced sales by 02 while higher prices had an unfavorable impact on volume and product mix we offset this in part with our initiatives to drive growth through new product introductions and brand marketing in 2012 our new product launches included a line of gourmet recipe mixes authentic hispanic recipe mixes zatarains frozen dinners for two new varieties of grill mates ®  and in canada club house brand grinders a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was in support of our new products we also increased our digital marketing activity which offers a more personal way to interact with consumers recipe views at wwwmccormickcom rose 30 in 2012 and our facebook fan base grew to 15 million in 2011 we reported that an estimated 10 million in sales shifted from the first quarter of 2011 into the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of customer purchases in advance of a late 2010 price increase 

in emea consumer business sales increased 153 with our 2011 acquisition of kamis adding 169 to sales unfavorable foreign currency decreased sales 57 in local currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions we grew sales 41 with 29 from volume and product mix and 12 from pricing actions during 2012 we successfully completed the integration of kamis and sales from this polandbased business benefited from particular strength in its subsidiary in russia for the base business in emea strong execution behind product innovation brand marketing and new distribution enabled us to achieve growth in a difficult economic environment we have moved to a masterbrand approach to gain synergies and efficiencies in product development and brand marketing support across our countryspecific brands new products introduced in 2012 included bag n season ®  grill mates recipe inspirations ®  and a number of vahiné brand dessert items 

in the asiapacific region sales rose 653 the impact of our 2011 kohinoor joint venture added 538 to sales and favorable foreign exchange rates added 04 we grew sales in local currency excluding the impact of kohinoor 111 with 77 from volume and product mix and 34 from pricing this increase was driven by china where we achieved rapid sales growth of 231 based largely on increased consumer demand in our other market australia we grew sales 29 despite a difficult competitive environment due in part to new product activity 

consumer business operating income rose to 4561 million from 4284 million in 2011 a 64 increase the growth in operating income was the result of higher sales and cci savings also operating income in 2011 included the impact of 109 million of transaction costs related to the completion of acquisitions that year in 2012 we invested 132 million in additional brand marketing support operating income margin was 189 in 2012 compared to 195 in 2011 this reduction is due in part to the mix of business across regions as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

industrial business 

  



sales for the industrial business grew 68 from 2011 pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 53 while volume and product mix added 31 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 16 both food manufacturers and foodservice customers continue to have an interest in products that feature all natural ingredients reduced sodium and other healthy attributes these types of projects accounted for more than 30 of our product development activity during 2012 

in the americas we grew industrial business sales 82 with 64 from pricing actions and a 28 increase from favorable volume and product mix partially offset by a decrease of 10 from unfavorable foreign exchange rates we grew sales of seasonings and flavors to a number of food manufacturers and also increased sales of branded items to foodservice distributors however for the quick service restaurant industry we saw lower demand for our products and less customerdriven innovation during this period 

in emea industrial business sales rose 55 with a 77 increase in volume and product mix as well as a 36 increase from pricing actions partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced sales by 58 demand from quick service restaurants remained strong and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose 11 higher pricing added 24 and favorable foreign exchange rates added 12 while volume and product mix declined 25 by comparison volume and product mix for our industrial business in the asiapacific region rose 107 in 2011 and included a significant impact from new product introductions and regional expansion by quick service restaurants 

industrial business operating income increased to 1222 million in 2012 from 1119 million in 2011 a 92 increase the growth in operating income was driven largely by higher sales and cost savings from cci our industrial business operating income margin in 2012 was 76 compared to 75 in 2011 

nongaap financial measures 

the tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share each excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013 there were no adjustments to 2012 or 2011 financial results these represent nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we believe this nongaap information is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

in 2013 we recorded 250 million of special charges related to reorganization activities in the emea region and 153 million of loss on voluntary pension settlement related to our us pension plan for a lump sum distribution to former employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits we are treating these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as adjustments to our operating income net income and diluted earnings per share we are providing nongaap results that exclude the impact of these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as it allows for a better comparison of 2013 financial results to 2012 and 2011 see notes 3 and 9 of the financial statements for additional information on the special charges and the loss on voluntary pension settlement respectively 

these nongaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 



in addition to the above nongaap measures we use total debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda as a measure of leverage ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are both nongaap financial measures this ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations our target for total debt to ebitda excluding the temporary impact from acquisition activity is 15 to 17 we believe that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus expenses of interest income taxes depreciation and amortization special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement the following table reconciles our adjusted ebitda to our net income 



  

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate in 2014 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2013 the exchange rates for the euro polish zloty and british pound sterling were higher versus the us dollar compared to 2012 at november 30 2013 the exchange rate for the canadian dollar australian dollar and indian rupee versus the us dollar were lower than at november 30 2012 

operating cash flow –  operating cash flow was 4652 million in 2013 4550 million in 2012 and 3400 million in 2011 the variability between years is due in part to changes in pension contributions which were 427 million in 2013 1043 million in 2012 and 427 million in 2011 the change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations as it was a use of cash in 2013 and 2011 and a source of cash in 2012 higher net income in 2012 compared to 2011 was also a factor in the increased cash flow in 2012 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the increase in ccc from 2012 to 2013 is due to an increase in our days sales outstanding and a decrease in our days payable outstanding the increase in days sales outstanding was due in part to a greater customer response in 2013 to our us holiday display program which includes extended terms the decrease in ccc from 2011 to 2012 is mainly due to a decrease in our days in inventory as a result of decreased strategic raw material inventory in the future we expect to continue to reduce ccc by decreasing our days in inventory 

investing cash flow –  net cash used in investing activities was 2397 million in 2013 1090 million in 2012 and 5375 million in 2011 the variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses and joint venture interests which amounted to 1423 million in 2013 and 4414 million in 2011 we did not make any acquisitions in 2012 see note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to these acquisitions capital expenditures were 999 million in 2013 1103 million in 2012 and 967 million in 2011 we expect 2014 capital expenditures to range between 120 million and 130 million 

financing cash flow –  net cash used in financing activities was 2459 million in 2013 and 3243 million in 2012 in 2011 net cash provided from financing activities was 1878 million the variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase and dividend activity described below and of changes in our net borrowing activity in 2013 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 667 million we received net cash proceeds of 2462 million from our issuance of 250 million of 350 notes due 2023 we used these net proceeds together with cash on hand to repay 250 million of maturing 525 notes and 14 million of other longterm debt and we increased our net shortterm borrowings by 719 million in 2013 in 2012 our net borrowing activity used cash of 805 million due principally to a 766 million net reduction in shortterm borrowings in 2011 our net borrowing activity provided cash of 3676 million in 2011 we received 2475 million from our issuance of 250 million of 390 notes due 2021 these proceeds were used to partially fund our acquisition of kamis in 2011 we also repaid 1011 million of longterm debt and increased our net shortterm borrowings by 2167 million 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs in millions 



as of november 30 2013 360 million remained of a 400 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in april 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed a previous 400 million share repurchase program that had been authorized in june 2010 

the common stock issued in 2013 2012 and 2011 relates to our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2013 the board of directors approved an 88 increase in the quarterly dividend from 034 to 037 per share during the past five years dividends per share have risen at a compound annual rate of 90 



the changes in our total debt to adjusted ebitda from 2011 to 2013 are mainly due to changes in our debt in conjunction with acquisition activity and the subsequent reduction of that debt in 2011 we increased our debt levels to help fund our kohinoor kamis and kitchen basics acquisitions during 2012 the debt associated with these acquisitions was reduced to bring our total debt to ebitda within our target range of 15 to 17 for 2013 our ebitda is lower due to the impact of the special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement excluding the impact of special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement adjusted ebitda for 2013 was 7222 million and the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda was 171 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at year end we temporarily used 1023 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2013 and 2012 were 3907 million and 4176 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2013 and 2012 was 13957 million and 14226 million respectively 

in november 2012 and in april and august 2013 we entered into a total of 175 million of forwardstarting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in august 2013 we cash settled all of these agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges for a gain of 90 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an allin effective fixed rate of 330 on the full 250 million of debt the gain on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to reduce interest expense over the life of the notes hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements was not material 

see notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets –  global credit and capital markets continued to improve in 2013 the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth dividends and capital expenditures for 2013 2012 and the first half of 2011 we also used this cash to make share repurchases in the second half of 2011 we used operating cash flow to help fund our 2011 acquisitions of kamis kohinoor and kitchen basics we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements 

our major revolving credit facility has a total committed capacity of 600 million which expires in 2016 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 1254 million as of november 30 2013 we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 427 million in 2013 1043 million in 2012 and 427 million in 2011 our cash contributions in 2012 include a 35 million contribution made late in the fiscal year to bring the pension plans funding status within company guidelines it is expected that the 2014 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 16 million primarily for international plans future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all plans approximately 66 of assets are invested in equities 29 in fixed income investments and 5 in other investments see also note 9 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this discussion under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits we have a particular interest in emerging markets 

in 2013 we purchased the assets of wuhan asiapacific condiments co ltd wapc a privately held company based in china for 1448 million which included 1423 million of cash paid net of closing adjustments and the assumption of 25 million of liabilities the acquisition was financed with a combination of cash and debt wapc included in our consumer business segment manufactures and markets daqiao and chushile ®  brand bouillon products which have a leading position in the central region of china 

in 2011 we purchased the assets of kitchen basics inc based in the us for 40 million and the shares of kamis sa based in poland for 287 million both acquisitions are consumer businesses and were financed with a combination of cash and debt we also completed a joint venture with kohinoor foods ltd in india investing 113 million for an 85 interest in kohinoor speciality foods india private limited this was financed with a combination of cash and debt this joint venture is consolidated and included in our consumer business segment 

see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of these acquisitions

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee thai baht swiss franc and the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2013 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france the uk poland canada australia and india we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2013 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2013 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2013 



we have a number of smaller contracts with an aggregate notional value of 85 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc and the singapore dollar as of november 30 2013 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 01 million at november 30 2013 

included in the table above are 961 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than seven days that are used to hedge shortterm cash flow funding remaining contracts have durations of one to 12 months 

at november 30 2012 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and thai baht with a notional value of 1888 million all of which matured in 2013 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 10 million at november 30 2012 

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2013 and 2012 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

year of maturity at november 30 2013 



the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 520 notes due in 2015 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015 net interest payments are based on 3 month libor minus 005 during this period we issued 250 million of 575 notes due in 2017 in december 2007 forward treasury lock agreements of 150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 625 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due in 2021 in july 2011 forward treasury lock agreements of 200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 401 we issued 250 million of 350 notes due in 2023 in august 2013 forward treasury lock agreements of 175 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 330 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in 2013 our most significant raw materials were pepper dairy products rice capsicums red peppers and paprika onion garlic and soybean oil while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer business are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs and discount chains this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2013 

contractual cash obligations due by year 





 pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2013 and 2012 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer business sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are expensed based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2013 we had 17985 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 16547 million in the consumer segment and 1438 million in the industrial segment our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model or relieffromroyalty method and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset as of november 30 2013 we had 2697 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their estimated fair values we intend to continue to support our brand names 

below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2013 



income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows management has recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so management has considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2014 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 15 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2014 pension expense by approximately 8 million in addition see the preceding sections of mda and note 9 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 10 of the financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retail outlets food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our strategy for growth is to increase sales and profit by investing in the business and fueling that investment with our comprehensive continuous improvement  cci  cost savings cci is our ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization our longterm annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase operating income 7 to 9 and increase earnings per share 9 to 11 over time we expect similar contributions to sales growth largely from three sources 1 our base business–driven by brand marketing support expanded distribution and category growth 2 product innovation and 3 acquisitions in addition to fueling sales growth our cci program is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share 

our business generates strong cash flow and we have a balanced use of cash funding dividends which we have increased in each of the past 27 years capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases each year we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to earnings per share growth 

in 2012 our financial results were at or above these longterm goals sales grew 9 exceeding the longterm objective of 4 to 6 due to increased pricing taken in response to significant increases in raw and packaging material costs as well as incremental sales from three acquisitions completed in 2011 the increase in operating income of 7 was within our longterm goal but below our expectations of 9 to 11 growth in 2012 earnings per share rose 9 to 304 from 279 in 2011 this growth was achieved with the increase in operating income and a favorable income tax rate offset in part by lower income from unconsolidated operations which were under pressure from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates primarily the mexican peso 

we generated strong cash flow in 2012 net cash provided by operating activities reached a 455 million a 34 increase from 340 million in 2011 in addition to higher net income inventory was unchanged in 2012 in contrast to a significant increase in 2011 that was driven by higher costs strategic inventory purchases and acquisitions 

along with our solid financial performance there were a number of important accomplishments in 2012 which included 







results of operations—2012 compared to 2011 



sales for the fiscal year rose 86 from 2011 with strong growth in both of our consumer and industrial businesses pricing actions taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs added 44 to sales the incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 accounted for a 43 increase to sales and increased volume and product mix in the base business added 14 to sales the impact of foreign exchange rates was unfavorable in 2012 reducing sales 15 

in 2012 gross profit increased 63 however our gross profit margin declined 90 basis points in fiscal year 2012 we were able to offset the dollar impact of a high single digit increase in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings in 2012 cci cost savings totaled 56 million of which 39 million lowered cost of goods sold while pricing and cci cost savings offset the dollar impact of increased material costs the net impact of these factors caused downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of net sales margins were further pressured by our mix of sales in 2012 as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our gross profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

in 2013 we expect material cost inflation to moderate to an increase of approximately 3 due to the low interest rate environment retirement benefit expense is expected to increase by 22 million in 2013 about 40 of this increase is expected to impact cost of goods sold 



selling general and administrative expenses increased 58 in 2012 from 2011 but decreased as a percentage of net sales for those same time periods the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales was primarily driven by a leveraging effect of our higher sales on these costs we had a benefit from cci cost savings that lowered sga 17 million in 2012 and a favorable comparison to 2011 when sga included 109 million of transaction costs related to completed acquisitions while 2012 had only 17 million of such costs 

during 2012 we increased brand marketing support by 110 million to 1983 million a large portion of this increase was in digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support 

in 2013 due to the low interest rate environment retirement benefit expense is expected to increase by 22 million about 60 of this increase is expected to impact sga 



interest expense for 2012 was higher than the prior year the impact of higher average debt balances in 2012 compared to 2011 was partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates for 2012 compared to 2011 the higher average debt balances in 2012 were due to the acquisitions completed late in 2011 



in 2012 we repatriated 700 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries this transaction generated us foreign tax credits due to the mix of foreign earnings that related to this cash these us foreign tax credits reduced 2012 tax expense by 97 million and were the major driving factor in a reduction in the tax rate for 2012 as compared to the prior year 

discrete tax benefits in 2012 were 20 million compared to 08 million in 2011 the increase in 2012 is mainly due to the reversal of a portion of a valuation allowance originally established against a subsidiarys net operating losses this subsidiary has established a pattern of profitability which resulted in us concluding that a portion of the valuation allowance should be reversed 

in 2010 the internal revenue service irs commenced an examination of our us federal income tax return for the 2007 and 2008 tax years during the course of the examination we held discussions with the irs on certain issues and in october 2012 we received proposed adjustments for these tax years in november 2012 we deposited 188 million with the irs to stop any potential interest on these proposed adjustments we believe we have established appropriate deferred taxes or tax accruals under us gaap for these issues in prior periods while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of uncertain tax positions we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome we will continue to update these unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances in the future 

in addition see note 10 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 39 million in 2012 compared to 2011 most of this decrease is attributable to our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico which was negatively impacted by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate between the mexican peso an the us dollar for most of 2012 while this business grew sales 6 profits were also pressured by higher soybean oil cost a main ingredient for mayonnaise which is the leading product for this joint venture this situation began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the yearonyear impact in the fourth quarter of 2012 had eased 

in 2012 our mccormick de mexico joint venture represented 59 of the sales and 82 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures we own a 26 share in our eastern condiments joint venture and on average own 50 of our other unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 304 in 2012 compared to 279 in 2011 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2011 to 2012 



consumer business 

  



we grew consumer business sales 98 in 2012 when compared to 2011 which included a 72 increase from acquisitions completed in 2011 the remaining increase was driven by higher pricing which added 37 and volume and product mix which added 03 unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales by 14 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 40 primarily as a result of pricing actions which added 45 these pricing actions taken in response to an increase in material costs went into effect late in fiscal year 2011 our 2011 acquisition of kitchen basics ®  added 08 to sales volume and product mix reduced sales by 11 and foreign exchange rates reduced sales by 02 while higher prices had an unfavorable impact on volume and product mix we offset this in part with our initiatives to drive growth through new product introductions and brand marketing in 2012 our new product launches included a line of gourmet recipe mixes authentic hispanic recipe mixes zatarains frozen dinners for two new varieties of grill mates and in canada club house brand grinders a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was in support of our new products we also increased our digital marketing activity which offers a more personal way to interact with consumers recipe views at wwwmccormickcom rose 30 in 2012 and our facebook fan base grew to 15 million in 2011 we reported that an estimated 10 million in sales shifted from the first quarter of 2011 into the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of customer purchases in advance of a late 2010 price increase 

in europe the middle east and africa emea consumer business sales increased 153 with our 2011 acquisition of kamis adding 169 to sales unfavorable foreign currency decreased sales 57 in local currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions we grew sales 41 with 29 from volume and product mix and 12 from pricing actions during 2012 we successfully completed the integration of kamis and sales from this polandbased business benefited from particular strength in its subsidiary in russia for the base business in emea strong execution behind product innovation brand marketing and new distribution enabled us to achieve growth in a difficult economic environment we have moved to a masterbrand approach to gain synergies and efficiencies in product development and brand marketing support across our countryspecific brands new products introduced in 2012 included bag n season ®  grill mates ®  recipe inspirations ®  and a number of vahiné brand dessert items 

in the asiapacific region sales rose 653 the impact of our 2011 kohinoor joint venture added 538 to sales and favorable foreign exchange rates added 04 we grew sales in local currency excluding the impact of kohinoor 111 with 77 from volume and product mix and 34 from pricing this increase was driven by china where we achieved rapid sales growth of 231 based largely on increased consumer demand in our other market australia we grew sales 29 despite a difficult competitive environment due in part to new product activity 

consumer business operating income rose to 4561 million from 4284 million in 2011 a 64 increase the growth in operating income was the result of higher sales and cci savings also operating income in 2011 included the impact of 109 million of transaction costs related to the completion of acquisitions that year in 2012 we invested 132 million in additional brand marketing support operating income margin was 189 in 2012 compared to 195 in 2011 this reduction is due in part to the mix of business across regions as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the us where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity 

industrial business 

  



sales for the industrial business grew 68 from 2011 pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 53 while volume and product mix added 31 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates decreased sales 16 both food manufacturers and foodservice customers continue to have an interest in products that feature all natural ingredients reduced sodium and other healthy attributes these types of projects accounted for more than 30 of our product development activity during 2012 

in the americas we grew industrial business sales 82 with 64 from pricing actions and a 28 increase from favorable volume and product mix partially offset by a decrease of 10 from unfavorable foreign exchange rates we grew sales of seasonings and flavors to a number of food manufacturers and also increased sales of branded items to foodservice distributors however for the quick service restaurant industry we saw lower demand for our products and less customerdriven innovation during this period 

in emea industrial business sales rose 55 with a strong 77 increase in volume and product mix as well as a 36 increase from pricing actions these were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced sales by 58 demand from quick service restaurants remains robust and we are meeting this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose 11 higher pricing added 24 and favorable foreign exchange rates added 12 while volume and product mix declined 25 by comparison volume and product mix for our industrial business in the asiapacific region rose 107 in 2011 and included a significant impact from new product introductions and regional expansion by quick service restaurants while we did not have a similar incremental benefit from new product and customer promotion activity in 2012 we believe this part of our business continues to offer longterm growth 

industrial business operating income increased to 1222 million from 1119 million in 2011 a 92 increase the growth in operating income was driven largely by higher sales and cost savings from cci our industrial business operating income margin ended 2012 at 76 compared to 75 in 2011 

results of operations—2011 compared to 2010 



sales for the fiscal year rose 108 from 2010 with doubledigit growth in both of our consumer and industrial businesses our pricing actions which were taken to offset the impact of steep increases in material costs added 46 to sales and favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales another 21 new product introductions expanded distribution and brand marketing support led to favorable volume and product mix which combined added 25 to sales acquisitions added 16 to sales 



in 2011 gross profit increased 74 however our gross profit margin declined 130 basis points in fiscal year 2011 we experienced a double digit increase in raw material and packaging costs while we were able to offset the dollar impact of these costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings the net impact of these factors caused downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of net sales in addition we had a negative effect on gross margin from product and segment mix in the year product mix was unfavorable in our industrial business with an increased demand for ingredients and weak demand for branded foodservice products during this period unfavorable segment mix was due to the higher sales growth rate of our industrial business which has lower gross margin than our consumer business cci cost savings totaled 65 million in 2011 of which 45 million lowered cost of goods sold 



selling general and administrative expenses in total dollars increased in 2011 compared to 2010 but decreased as a percentage of net sales for those same time periods the increase in total dollars was largely driven by higher incremental brand marketing support sga of acquired businesses and 109 million of transaction costs related to completed acquisitions the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales is primarily driven by lower selling costs as a percentage of net sales 

during 2011 we increased brand marketing support by 201 million or 12 a portion of this increase was in digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support we nearly doubled our digital marketing in the past year including a program behind grill mates in the us that contributed to a 7 unit increase in 2011 we also increased support behind our hispanic products in the us which included television and a sampling program this helped drive a 9 increase in sales of hispanic products which exceeded 100 million for the first time in 2011 



interest expense for 2011 was higher than the prior year this was caused by higher average debt balances due to our acquisitions in 2011 and a slightly higher weightedaverage interest rate 



the increase in the tax rate in 2011 was due to a lower level of net discrete tax benefits decreased us foreign tax credits in the current year as compared to the prior year partially offset by a favorable mix of earnings among our different tax jurisdictions 

discrete tax benefits in 2011 were 08 million compared to 201 million in 2010 the 201 million in 2010 was mainly due to a 139 million reversal of a tax accrual for a closed tax year this tax accrual was recorded in a prior period based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions related to the reorganization of our european operations and divestment of certain of our joint ventures 

in 2010 us foreign tax credits included the impact of a 1085 million repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries due to the mix of foreign earnings related to this cash the repatriation generated additional tax credits 

in addition see note 10 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 



income from unconsolidated operations decreased 01 million in 2011 compared to 2010 we increased income with our unconsolidated joint venture in india eastern condiments which was completed late in fiscal year 2010 this was offset by investment spending behind our new joint venture in turkey and decreases in some of our smaller joint ventures our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico had net income comparable to the prior year while this business grew sales 12 profits were pressured by higher soybean oil cost and a weakening mexico peso in the fourth quarter of 2011 

we own a 26 share in our eastern condiments joint venture and on average own 50 of our other unconsolidated joint ventures in 2011 sales of these joint ventures grew 32 to 709 million at 100 of these businesses with many products marketed under the mccormick name the eastern condiments joint venture added 18 while existing joint ventures increased sales by 14 

we reported diluted earnings per share of 279 in 2011 compared to 275 in 2010 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2010 to 2011 



consumer business 

  



we grew consumer business sales 100 in 2011 when compared to 2010 higher pricing added 51 and favorable foreign exchange rates added 18 volume and product mix rose 31 which included a 26 increase from acquisitions in 2011 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 82 primarily as a result of pricing actions which added 60 our acquisition of kitchen basics added 11 to sales other increases in volume and product mix added 04 and favorable foreign exchange rates added 07 increased pricing unfavorably impacted volume and product mix during 2011 in addition an estimated 10 million in sales shifted from the first quarter of 2011 into the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of customer purchases in advance of a late 2010 price increase however the impact of these reductions to volume and product mix were more than offset by a favorable impact of product innovation brand marketing support and expanded distribution new products introduced in 2011 included new recipe inspirations grinders grill mates and reduced sodium dry seasoning mixes we had particular success with new zatarain’s frozen entrees which helped contribute to a 40 increase in sales of zatarain’s frozen products a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was directed toward a new advertising campaign for dry seasoning mixes a hispanic marketing program that included sampling and a digital marketing program behind grill mates which contributed to a 7 unit increase in grill mates sales new distribution was gained for both brand and private label items in a variety of retail channels that included grocery warehouse clubs dollar stores and drug chains 

in europe the middle east and africa emea consumer business sales increased 135 our acquisition of kamis added 65 to sales favorable foreign exchange rates added 42 and pricing actions added 28 in our largest market france we achieved solid growth with higher pricing which was slightly offset by lower volume and product mix we introduced nearly 40 new products in this market including an organic line of ducros spices and herbs and a number of vahiné dessert items and gained new distribution with a large grocery retailer a highly competitive retail environment in the uk made sales growth in this market a challenge even with the introduction of new products and distribution gains into smaller store formats with a major customer we adapted to this environment by redirecting a portion of our brand marketing support to emphasize the value of our products accelerating the introduction of new products and working to achieve secondary placement of our brand in retail stores export sales into developing markets contributed to growth in 2011 and we improved results in smaller markets such as spain and portugal which experienced significant declines in 2010 

consumer business sales in the asiapacific region rose 225 favorable foreign exchange rates added 94 to sales the impact of our new kohinoor joint venture added 91 to sales other increases in volume and product mix added 20 and pricing actions added 20 sales in china grew 10 in local currency during the year as a result of pricing actions product introductions and new television advertising our business in australia was unfavorably impacted by a challenging competitive environment leading to a modest decline in 2011 sales when measured in local currency 

consumer business operating income increased 260 million to 4284 million a 65 increase from 2010 the profit impact of higher sales and cci savings were offset in part by increased material costs we also funded an increased investment in brand marketing support which rose 15 million in 2011 including a 4 million increase that related to acquisitions profit from our 2011 acquisitions had a minimal impact on 2011 operating income during a period of integration in 2011 we recorded 109 million of transaction costs related to acquisitions completed in 2011 which lowered operating income margin by 05 operating income margin was 195 in 2011 compared to 201 in 2010 

industrial business 

  



sales for the industrial business grew 119 from 2010 with higher volume and product mix adding 55 to sales pricing actions added 39 while favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales 25 

in the americas industrial business sales rose 102 with a 47 increase from favorable volume and product mix 45 from pricing actions and 10 from favorable foreign exchange rates strong sales to food manufacturers were driven in part by the development of new products and increased demand for snack seasonings and ingredients particularly in the us and mexico while sales to the foodservice industry were favorably impacted by product introductions a number of our customers were impacted by the weak economy both food manufacturers and foodservice customers continue to have an interest in products that feature all natural ingredients reduced sodium and other healthy attributes these types of projects accounted for 40 of our product development activity in the us during 2011 

in emea industrial business sales rose 123 with a 58 increase from favorable volume and product mix 29 from pricing actions and 36 from favorable foreign exchange rates as in 2010 demand from quick service restaurants was high and continued to be the key sales driver in this region we had particular strength in the sales of products that we manufacture in our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa for these customers and supported their expansion in russia and the middle east 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose 220 favorable volume and product mix grew sales 107 favorable foreign exchange rates added 90 and increased pricing actions added 23 as in emea sales to quick service restaurants were a source of strong growth in 2011 the rapid expansion of quick service restaurants in this region and our new product activity contributed to a 15 increase of industrial business sales in china when measured in local currency we also supported the expansion of quick service restaurants into india further adding to our sales growth in this region 

industrial business operating income increased 45 million to 1119 million a 42 increase from 2010 the profit impact of higher sales and cci cost savings were offset in part by increased material costs and an investment in our branded foodservice business with 5 million of incremental marketing support the net effect of these items along with our sales mix of products during 2011 led to a decline in industrial business operating income margin to 75 from 80 in 2011 since 2005 we have improved the operating income margin of this business and expect to achieve further improvements in margin in a less volatile input cost environment and as a result of our development of more valueadded higher margin new products 

nongaap financial measures 

the tables below include financial measures of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the benefit of the reversal of a significant tax accrual in 2010 there were no adjustments to 2012 or 2011 financial results this is a nongaap financial measure which is prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we believe this nongaap information is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends 

in 2010 our discrete tax benefits included a 139 million reversal of a tax accrual for a closed tax year this tax accrual was recorded in a prior period based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions related to the reorganization of our european operations and divestment of certain of our joint ventures we are treating this 139 million discrete tax benefit as a nongaap adjustment to our diluted earnings per share we are providing nongaap results that exclude the impact of this reversal as the item to which it relates was recorded as a restructuring charge and it allows for a better comparison of 2010 financial results to 2011 and 2012 when we had restructuring charges in periods prior to 2010 we used nongaap financial measures to display earnings exclusive of these restructuring charges 

these nongaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 



in addition to the nongaap measures for net income and diluted earnings per share we use total debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda as a measure of leverage ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are both nongaap financial measures this ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations our target for total debt to ebitda excluding the temporary impact from acquisition activity is 15 to 17 we believe that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda 

we define ebitda as net income plus expenses of interest income taxes depreciation and amortization the following table reconciles our ebitda to our net income 



  

liquidity and financial condition 



we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives increase our dividend fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate in 2013 we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and use a portion of our cash flow from operations to help fund our acquisition of wuhan asiapacific condiments co ltd which is expected to close midyear 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2012 the exchange rates for the canadian dollar australian dollar polish zloty and british pound sterling were slightly higher versus the us dollar compared to 2011 at november 30 2012 the exchange rate for the euro and indian rupee versus the us dollar were lower than at november 30 2011 

operating cash flow –  when 2012 is compared to 2011 the increase in operating cash flow was led by a small decrease in inventory whereas in 2011 we had a significant increase in inventory in addition we generated cash from higher net income in 2012 our total pension contributions were 1043 million in 2012 as compared to 427 million in 2011 which provided a partial offset to the increases noted above 

when 2011 is compared to 2010 the decrease in operating cash flow was driven by a higher level of inventory in 2011 as compared to the prior year the increase in inventory in 2011 was largely due to an increase in our strategic positions for a number of spices and herbs and the higher cost impact of raw materials from inflation these uses of operating cash were partially offset by a higher level of cash generated from improved net income in 2011 our total pension contributions were 427 million in 2011 as compared to 495 million in 2010 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 



the decrease in ccc from 2011 to 2012 is mainly due to a decrease in our days in inventory as a result of decreased strategic raw material inventory the increase in ccc from 2010 to 2011 is largely due to an increase in our days in inventory in the future we expect to continue to reduce ccc by decreasing our days in inventory 

investing cash flow –  the changes in cash used in investing activities from 2010 to 2012 were primarily due to fluctuations in cash used for acquisition of businesses and joint venture interests in 2011 and 2010 with no acquisitions in 2012 we invested 4414 million and 469 million in acquisitions and joint venture interests in 2011 and 2010 respectively see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of these acquisitions capital expenditures were 1103 million in 2012 967 million in 2011 and 890 million in 2010 we expect 2013 capital expenditures to be slightly above depreciation and amortization expense 

financing cash flow –  the change in cash flow from financing activities from 2010 to 2012 is primarily due to a change in net borrowings in 2012 we repaid borrowings of 805 million including shortterm borrowings of 766 million in 2011 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due 2021 with net cash proceeds received of 2475 million the net proceeds from this offering were used to fund in part our acquisition of kamis in 2011 we also increased our shortterm borrowings by 2167 million and repaid 1000 million in longterm debt in 2010 we repaid borrowings of 1140 million which included shortterm borrowings of 996 million and 144 million in longterm debt 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs in millions 



in june 2010 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to 400 million of our outstanding shares in september 2010 we completed a 400 million share repurchase program authorized by the board in june 2005 as of november 30 2012 137 million remained of the new share repurchase program 

the common stock issued in 2012 2011 and 2010 relates to our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 



in november 2012 the board of directors approved a 97 increase in the quarterly dividend from 031 to 034 per share during the past five years dividends per share have risen at a compound annual rate of 91 



the changes in our total debt to ebitda from 2010 to 2012 are mainly due to changes in our debt in conjunction with acquisition activity and subsequent reduction of that debt in 2011 we increased our debt levels to help fund our kohinoor kamis and kitchen basics acquisitions during 2012 the debt associated with these acquisitions was reduced to bring our total debt to ebitda within our target range of 15 to 17 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at yearend we temporarily used 1656 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2012 and 2011 were 4172 million and 3440 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2012 and 2011 was 14222 million and 12615 million respectively 

in november 2012 we entered into a total of 50 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of at least 50 million of fixed rates notes by august 2013 we intend to issue fixed rate notes in 2013 to retire the 250 million of notes that are coming due in september 2013 we intend to cash settle these swap agreements upon issuance of the fixed rate notes thereby effectively locking in the interest rate in effect at the time the swap agreements were initiated the fixed rate of these agreements is 190 we have designated these forward starting interest rate swap agreements which expire on august 28 2013 as cash flow hedges the gain or loss on these agreements is deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the life of the fixed rate notes as a component of interest expense hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements was not material in the year 

in may and june 2011 we entered into a total of 200 million of forward us treasury rate lock agreements to manage the us treasury portion of our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in july 2011 we cash settled all of these agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges for a loss of 02 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an all in effective fixed rate of 401 on the full 250 million of debt the loss on these agreements is deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements was not material 

see notes 5 and 6 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets –  while global and european credit markets have stabilized in 2012 the global economy is still fragile the following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth dividends and capital expenditures for 2012 the second half of 2010 and the first half of 2011 we also used this cash to make share repurchases in the first half of 2010 we used operating cash flow to pay down debt incurred in the lawry’s acquisition and did not repurchase shares in the second half of 2011 we used operating cash flow to help fund our 2011 acquisitions of kamis kohinoor and kitchen basics we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements our major revolving credit facility has a total committed capacity of 600 million which expires in 2016 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 555 million as of november 30 2012 we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see also note 5 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 1043 million in 2012 427 million in 2011 and 495 million in 2010 our cash contributions in 2012 include a 35 million contribution made late in the fiscal year to bring the pension plans funding status within company guidelines it is expected that the 2013 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 45 million future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all plans approximately 60 of assets are invested in equities 30 in fixed income investments and 10 in other investments see also note 8 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this mda under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits we have a particular interest in emerging markets 

in august 2012 we signed an agreement to purchase the assets of wuhan asiapacific condiments co ltd wapc a privately held company based in china the completion of the acquisition is expected to occur in mid2013 subject to regulatory approval and will be included in our consumer business segment we have agreed to acquire the company for approximately 141 million subject to certain closing adjustments 

in 2011 we purchased the assets of kitchen basics inc based in the us for 40 million and the shares of kamis sa based in poland for 287 million both deals are consumer businesses and were financed with a combination of cash and debt we also completed a joint venture with kohinoor foods ltd in india we invested 113 million for an 85 interest in kohinoor speciality foods india private limited financed with a combination of cash and debt this joint venture is consolidated and included in our consumer business segment see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of these acquisitions

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 5 and 6 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk –  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee thai baht swiss franc and the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2012 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france the uk poland canada and australia we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2012 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2012 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

 foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2012 



we have a number of smaller contracts with an aggregate notional value of 47 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc and the singapore dollar as of november 30 2012 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 01 million at november 30 2012 

included in the table above are 849 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than 7 days that are used to hedge shortterm cash flow funding remaining contracts have durations of one to twelve months 

at november 30 2011 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and thai baht with a notional value of 1276 million all of which matured in 2012 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 23 million at november 30 2011 

interest rate risk –  our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2012 and 2011 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

year of maturity at november 30 2012 



year of maturity at november 30 2011 



the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 520 notes due in 2015 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015 net interest payments are based on 3 month libor minus 005 during this period we issued 250 million of 575 notes due in 2017 in december 2007 forward treasury lock agreements of 150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 625 we issued 250 million of 525 notes due in 2013 in september 2008 forward treasury lock agreements of 100 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 554 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due in 2021 in july 2011 forward treasury lock agreements of 200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 401 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control our most significant raw materials are dairy products pepper rice capsicums red peppers and paprika onion soybean oil and wheat while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer business are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs and discount chains this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2012 

contractual cash obligations due by year 





 in 2013 our pension and postretirement contributions are expected to be approximately 45 million pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2012 and 2011 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer business sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are expensed based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2012 we had 16953 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 15510 million in the consumer segment and 1443 million in the industrial segment our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model or relieffromroyalty method and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset as of november 30 2012 we had 2561 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their estimated fair values we intend to continue to support our brand names 

below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2012 



income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities may challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows management has recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so management has considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2013 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 20 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2013 pension expense by approximately 8 million in addition see the preceding sections of mda and note 8 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 9 of the financial statements

we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments

trademarks licenses and patents

we also own various patents none of which individually are viewed as material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in mccormick’s business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter mccormick usually builds its inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 5 of the financial statements and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis”

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including the risks described below if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in private label use by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact us 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law we also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands 

  

through effective marketing and other measures a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of branded and private label product offerings if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label it could have a significant impact on our consumer business 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness a product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could cause consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients and otherwise have a negative effect on our business and financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our reputation or brands 

the consolidation of customers may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue throughout the us the european union and other major markets such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability 

issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper garlic onion capsicums red pepper and paprika soybean oil and wheat while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield government actions political unrest in producing countries changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities could also create additional risks for food safety although we have adopted rigorous quality 

  

assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures which may adversely affect our profitability such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in many of the countries in which we sell our products we are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the sourcing manufacture storage marketing advertising and distribution of food products including laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment relations with distributors and retailers employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect our business financial condition or operating results 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

we could have an interruption in our business loss of inventory or data be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster catastrophic event epidemic or computer system failure natural disasters could include an earthquake fire flood tornado or severe storm a catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack an epidemic could affect our operating activities major facilities or employees’ and customers’ health in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that a natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these potential acquisitions and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated 

  

revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2011 40 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties beginning in 2011 several countries within the european union experienced sovereign debt and credit issues this has caused more volatility in the economic environment throughout the european union additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the british pound sterling versus the euro and the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee and thai baht we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of 217 million at an average interest rate of approximately 02 on november 30 2011 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements our syndicate of banks include certain european banks that could be affected by the current volatile credit market in the european union we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the 

  

relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand mccormick  company incorporated our operations and our present business environment mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report 

mccormick is a global leader in flavor the company manufactures markets and distributes spices seasoning mixes condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retail outlets food manufacturers and foodservice businesses we currently manage our business in two operating segments consumer and industrial as described in item 1 of this report 

our strategy for growth is to increase sales and profit by investing in the business and fueling that investment with cci cost savings our longterm annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4 to 6 increase operating income 7 to 9 and increase earnings per share 9 to 11 over time we expect similar contributions to sales growth from our base business–driven by brand marketing support expanded distribution and category growth from product innovation and from acquisitions in addition to sales growth our comprehensive continuous improvement program–cci–is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share cci is our ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization 

our business generates strong cash flow and we have a balanced use of cash funding dividends which have increased in each of the past 26 years capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchases each year we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2 to increased earnings per share 

in 2011 our financial results varied from these longterm goals sales grew 11 exceeding the longterm objective of 4 to 6 due primarily to increased prices taken in response to significant increases in raw and packaging material costs the increase in operating income of 6 was close to our long term expectations several factors affected earnings per share which was 279 in 2011 compared to 275 in 2010 as explained in more detail in the following section we recorded transaction costs associated with completed acquisitions which lowered 2011 earnings per share 007 in addition we recorded the reversal of a significant tax accrual in 2010 that added 010 to earnings per share 

in addition to strong financial results we had a number of important accomplishments which included 

 

   in a challenging economic environment and period of material cost volatility we had a strong financial performance in 2011 

results of operations—2011 compared to 2010 

 

 sales for the fiscal year rose 108 from 2010 with doubledigit growth in both of our consumer and industrial businesses our pricing actions taken to offset the impact of steep increases in material costs added 46 to sales and favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales another 21 new product introductions expanded distribution and brand marketing support led to favorable volume and product mix which combined added 25 to sales acquisitions added 16 to sales 

 

 in 2011 gross profit increased 74 however our gross profit margin declined 130 basis points in fiscal year 2011 we experienced a double digit increase in raw material and packaging costs while we have been able to offset the dollar 

  

impact of these costs with our pricing actions and cci cost savings the net impact of these factors caused downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of net sales in addition we had a negative effect on gross margin from product and segment mix in the year product mix was unfavorable in our industrial business with an increased demand for ingredients and weak demand for branded foodservice products during this period unfavorable segment mix was due to the higher sales growth rate of our industrial business which has lower gross margin than our consumer business cci cost savings totaled 65 million in 2011 of which 45 million lowered cost of goods sold 

we are projecting our raw material and packaging costs to rise at a high single digit rate in fiscal year 2012 we expect that these cost increases will be offset by a combination of price increases some of which were initiated late in 2011 and cci cost savings 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses in total dollars increased in 2011 compared to 2010 but decreased as a percentage of net sales for those same time periods the increase in total dollars was largely driven by higher incremental brand marketing support sga of acquired businesses and 109 million of transaction costs related to completed acquisitions the decrease in sga as a percent of net sales is primarily driven by lower selling costs as a percentage of net sales 

during 2011 we increased brand marketing support by 201 million or 12 a portion of this increase was in digital marketing which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support we nearly doubled our digital marketing in the past year including a program behind grill mates ® in the us that contributed to a 7 unit increase in 2011 we also increased support behind our hispanic products in the us which included television and a sampling program this helped drive a 9 increase in sales of hispanic products which exceeded 100 million for the first time in 2011 

 

 interest expense for 2011 was higher than the prior year this was caused by higher average debt balances due to our acquisitions in 2011 and a slightly higher weightedaverage interest rate 

 

 the increase in the tax rate in 2011 was due to a lower level of net discrete tax benefits decreased us foreign tax credits in the current year as compared to the prior year partially offset by a favorable mix of earnings among our different tax jurisdictions 

discrete tax benefits in 2011 were 08 million compared to 201 million in 2010 the 201 million in 2010 was mainly due to a 139 million reversal of a tax accrual for a closed tax year this tax accrual was recorded in a prior period based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions related to the reorganization of our european operations and divestment of certain of our joint ventures 

in 2010 us foreign tax credits included the impact of a 1085 million repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries due to the mix of foreign earnings related to this cash the repatriation generated additional tax credits 

in addition see note 11 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 

 

 income from unconsolidated operations decreased 01 million in 2011 compared to 2010 we increased income with our unconsolidated joint venture in india eastern condiments which was completed late in fiscal year 2010 this was offset 

  

by investment spending behind our new joint venture in turkey and decreases in some of our smaller joint ventures our largest joint venture mccormick de mexico had net income comparable to the prior year while this business grew sales 12 profits were pressured by higher soybean oil cost and a weakening mexico peso in the fourth quarter of 2011 we expect this pressure on profits to continue into 2012 

we own a 26 share in our eastern condiments joint venture and on average own 50 of our other unconsolidated joint ventures in 2011 sales of these joint ventures grew 32 to 709 million at 100 of these businesses with many products marketed under the mccormick name the new eastern condiments joint venture added 18 while existing joint ventures increased sales by 14 

our mccormick de mexico joint venture represents 58 of the sales and 76 of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures 

we reported earnings per share of 279 in 2011 compared to 275 in 2010 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2010 to 2011 

 

 consumer business 

 

 we grew consumer business sales 100 in 2011 when compared to 2010 higher pricing added 51 and favorable foreign exchange rates added 18 volume and product mix rose 31 which included a 26 increase from acquisitions in 2011 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 82 primarily as a result of pricing actions which added 60 our acquisition of kitchen basics ® added 11 to sales other increases in volume and product mix added 04 and favorable foreign exchange rates added 07 increased pricing unfavorably impacted volume and product mix during 2011 in addition an estimated 10 million in sales shifted from the first quarter of 2011 into the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of customer purchases in advance of a late 2010 price increase however the impact of these reductions to volume and product mix were more than offset by a favorable impact of product innovation brand marketing support and expanded distribution new products introduced in 2011 included new recipe inspirations ®  grinders grill mates and reduced sodium dry seasoning mixes we had particular success with new zatarain’s frozen entrees which helped contribute to a 40 increase in sales of zatarain’s frozen products a portion of our incremental brand marketing support was directed toward a new advertising campaign for dry seasoning mixes a hispanic marketing program that included sampling and a digital marketing program behind grill mates which contributed to a 7 unit increase in grill mates sales new distribution was gained for both brand and private label items in a variety of retail channels that included grocery warehouse clubs dollar stores and drug chains 

in europe the middle east and africa emea consumer business sales increased 135 our acquisition of kamis added 65 to sales favorable foreign exchange rates added 42 and pricing actions added 28 in our largest market france we achieved solid growth with higher pricing which was slightly offset by lower volume and product mix we introduced nearly 40 new products in this market including an organic line of ducros spices and herbs and a number of vahiné dessert items and gained new distribution with a large grocery retailer a highly competitive retail environment in the uk made sales growth in this market a challenge even with the introduction of new products and distribution gains into smaller store formats with a major customer we have adapted to this environment by redirecting a portion of our brand marketing support to emphasize the value of our products accelerating the introduction of new products and working to achieve secondary placement of our brand in retail stores export sales into developing markets contributed to growth 

  

in 2011 and we had improved results in smaller markets such as spain and portugal which experienced significant declines in 2010 

consumer business sales in the asiapacific region rose 225 favorable foreign exchange rates added 94 to sales the impact of our new kohinoor joint venture added 91 to sales other increases in volume and product mix added 20 and pricing actions added 20 sales in china grew 10 in local currency during the year as a result of pricing actions product introductions and new television advertising our business in australia was unfavorably impacted by a challenging competitive environment leading to a modest decline in 2011 sales when measured in local currency 

consumer business operating income increased 260 million to 4284 million a 65 increase from 2010 the profit impact of higher sales and cci savings were offset in part by increased material costs we also funded an increased investment in brand marketing support which rose 15 million in 2011 including a 4 million increase that related to acquisitions while we expect the 2011 acquisitions to be accretive to 2012 operating income profit from these businesses had a minimal impact on 2011 operating income during a period of integration in 2011 we recorded 109 million of transaction costs related to acquisitions completed in 2011 which lowered operating income margin by 05 operating income margin was 195 in 2011 compared to 201 in 2010 

industrial business 

 

 sales for the industrial business grew 119 from 2010 with higher volume and product mix adding 55 to sales pricing actions added 39 while favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales 25 

in the americas industrial business sales rose 102 with a 47 increase from favorable volume and product mix 45 from pricing actions and 10 from favorable foreign exchange rates strong sales to food manufacturers were driven in part by the development of new products and increased demand for snack seasonings and ingredients particularly in the us and mexico 

while sales to the foodservice industry were favorably impacted by product introductions a number of our customers were impacted by the weak economy both food manufacturers and foodservice customers continue to have an interest in products that feature all natural ingredients reduced sodium and other healthy attributes these types of projects accounted for 40 of our product development activity in the us during 2011 

in emea industrial business sales rose 123 with a 58 increase from favorable volume and product mix 29 from pricing actions and 36 from favorable foreign exchange rates as in 2010 demand from quick service restaurants was high and continues to be the key sales driver in this region we had particular strength in the sales of products that we manufacture in our facilities in the uk turkey and south africa for these customers and supported their expansion in russia and the middle east 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose 220 favorable volume and product mix grew sales 107 favorable foreign exchange rates added 90 and increased pricing actions added 23 as in emea sales to quick service restaurants were a source of strong growth in 2011 the rapid expansion of quick service restaurants in this region and our new product activity contributed to a 15 increase of industrial business sales in china when measured in local currency we also supported the expansion of quick service restaurants into india further adding to our sales growth in this region 

industrial business operating income increased 45 million to 1119 million a 42 increase from 2010 the profit impact of higher sales and cci cost savings were offset in part by increased material costs and an investment in our branded foodservice business with 5 million of incremental marketing support the net effect of these items along with our sales mix of products 

  

during 2011 led to a decline in industrial business operating income margin to 75 from 80 in 2011 since 2005 we have improved the operating income margin of this business and expect to achieve further improvements in margin in a less volatile input cost environment and as a result of our development of more valueadded higher margin new products 

results of operations—2010 compared to 2009 

 

 sales for the fiscal year rose 45 from 2009 with strong growth in both the consumer and industrial businesses new product introductions brand marketing support and expanded distribution led to favorable volume and product mix which combined added 32 to sales the impact of pricing was minimal in 2010 reducing sales 03 while favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales 16 

 

 in 2010 gross profit increased 68 and gross profit margin rose 90 basis points a significant part of this improvement was due to our cci program which lowered costs 54 million in 2010 of which 45 million improved gross profit in addition the industrial business continued to shift its mix of business toward more higher margin valueadded products 

most raw and packaging material costs did not change significantly from 2009 through the first half of 2010 one exception was the lower cost of dairy ingredients which was passed through in lower pricing to industrial customers in the second half of 2010 input costs began to increase and unfavorably impacted gross profit margin in the fourth quarter pricing actions were taken toward the end of the year and continued in 2011 to offset a portion of these increases 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales increased in 2010 compared to 2009 the increases were mainly driven by incremental brand marketing support to invest in the growth of our leading brands as well as higher retirement benefit costs sga in 2009 included 75 million of expenses related to the bankruptcy of a uk foodservice distributor 

during 2010 we increased brand marketing support costs by 207 million or 14 the increased funding supported the launch of recipe inspirations perfect pinch ® and other new products we also drove sales with incremental spending behind our holiday cooking and baking advertising support for the zatarain’s brand and information regarding the antioxidant levels in many spices and herbs the increase in retirement benefit costs was primarily due to changes in actuarial assumptions 

in 2005 we announced a restructuring program to consolidate our global manufacturing rationalize our distribution facilities improve our gotomarket strategy and eliminate administrative redundancies this restructuring program was completed in 2009 more details of the restructuring charges are discussed in note 10 of the financial statements 

 

 lower total average debt outstanding coupled with lower shortterm interest rates led to a favorable variance in interest expense in 2010 when compared to 2009 in 2010 we completed the pay down of debt from the 2008 lawry’s acquisition primarily with cash generated from operations 

  

 the decrease in the tax rate in 2010 was due to a higher level of net discrete tax benefits increased us foreign tax credits and a favorable mix of earnings among our different foreign tax jurisdictions 

discrete tax benefits in 2010 were 201 million compared to 36 million in 2009 the 201 million in 2010 is mainly due to a 139 million reversal of a tax accrual for a closed tax year this tax accrual was recorded in a prior period based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions related to the reorganization of our european operations and divestment of certain of our joint ventures 

us foreign tax credits increased as a result of a 1085 million repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the mix of foreign earnings related to this cash the repatriation generated these tax credits 

in addition see note 11 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate with the effective tax rate 

 

 income from unconsolidated operations increased 92 million in 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was mainly due to the performance of our mccormick de mexico joint venture which experienced a doubledigit sales increase over the prior year also this joint venture benefited from lower soybean oil costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rates for 2010 compared to 2009 soybean oil is a main ingredient for mayonnaise which is the leading product for this joint venture in addition our other smaller joint ventures experienced good growth in both sales and income in 2010 

on average in 2009 and 2010 we owned 50 of our unconsolidated joint ventures these joint ventures had 2010 annual sales of 538 million at 100 of these businesses with many products marketed under the mccormick brand name in 2010 sales by these joint ventures increased 12 and net income increased 49 

we reported earnings per share of 275 in 2010 compared to 227 in 2009 the following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2009 to 2010 

 

 consumer business 

 

 in our consumer business higher volume and product mix added 31 to sales favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales 11 and higher pricing added 04 when compared to 2009 

in the americas consumer business sales rose 59 primarily as a result of higher volume and product mix which rose 41 foreign exchange rates in this region increased sales 11 and pricing added 07 recipe inspirations perfect pinch and other new product introductions contributed to this sales growth we also increased brand marketing support to build consumer awareness and trial of these new products as well as to support our broader line of spices and seasonings and other flavorful products as a result sales of gourmet items grilling items extracts lawry’s products and zatarain’s products were particularly strong in 2010 distribution gains added to sales including new placement in a warehouse club retail channel in the us and new distribution of billy bee ® honey products in canada in the fourth quarter of 2010 sales growth of our products in the us exceeded the increase in consumer purchases at retail by 

  

approximately 2 we believe that customer purchases in advance of a late 2010 price increase contributed to this difference as a result we estimate that 10 million of sales shifted from the first quarter of 2011 into the fourth quarter of 2010 

in europe the middle east and africa emea consumer business sales declined 18 pricing decreased 10 unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales 05 and unfavorable volume and product mix lowered sales 03 our largest markets the uk and france achieved an increase in volume and product mix with new products and marketing programs which supported products like schwartz flavourful seasoning mixes and vahiné homemade dessert products this growth was offset by declines in smaller markets including spain portugal italy the netherlands and belgium due in part to poor economies and competitive conditions in 2010 consumer demand in these markets was weak and retail customers lowered their inventory levels in total these smaller markets account for about 20 of emea sales 

consumer business sales in the asiapacific region rose 172 foreign exchange rates were favorable adding 90 to sales favorable volume and product mix grew sales 79 and pricing added 03 in china we grew sales at a doubledigit pace with the introduction of new products such as thai chili sauce which takes advantage of our leadership position in bottled condiments sales also rose as we expanded distribution of our products beyond modern grocery stores and into wet markets also known as “street” markets which are frequently shopped by many chinese consumers sales in australia also rose at a doubledigit rate but in local currency were close to 2009’s result 

consumer business operating income excluding restructuring charges increased 11 from 2009 the profit impact of higher sales and cci cost savings were largely offset by a 19 million increase in brand marketing support as well as higher retirement benefit costs operating income margin was 201 in 2010 in the fourth quarter of 2010 there was a decline of operating income when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 which was partially due to increasing commodity costs we took pricing actions in late 2010 and early in fiscal year 2011 in response to these cost increases 

industrial business 

 

 sales for the industrial business grew 44 from 2009 with higher volume and product mix adding 33 to sales favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales 25 and lower pricing reduced sales 14 

in the americas industrial business sales rose 18 with a 22 increase from favorable volume and product mix this increase was primarily driven by increased demand by food manufacturers for new products in both the us and mexico these customers were particularly interested in seasonings and other products with lower sodium reduced fat content and simple ingredients during 2010 sales to foodservice distributors quick service restaurants and other foodservice customers were comparable to the prior year the 22 increase in volume and product mix in 2010 was largely offset by the impact of reduced pricing as we passed through to our customers the lower cost of dairy ingredients foreign exchange rates in this region added 17 to sales 

in emea industrial business sales rose 79 led by a 44 increase from favorable volume and product mix higher demand from quick service restaurants reflected increased consumer traffic and new product wins sales of branded foodservice products were higher compared to a weak performance in 2009 when sales were disrupted by the bankruptcy of a major foodservice distributor in the uk favorable foreign exchange rates increased sales 30 and pricing added 05 

industrial business sales in the asiapacific region rose 162 favorable volume and product mix grew sales 93 quick service restaurants led the increase in this region driven by new store openings in china and new product 

  

introductions including beverage flavors and chicken marinades foreign exchange rates added 69 to the sales increase 

industrial business operating income excluding restructuring charges increased 261 from 2009 higher sales and a shift to more higher margin valueadded products increased profit as well as the impact of cci cost savings also in 2009 we recorded 75 million of costs related to the foodservice distributor bankruptcy in the uk these increases more than offset the higher retirement benefit costs in 2010 industrial business operating income margin excluding restructuring charges rose 130 basis points to 80 

nongaap financial measures 

the tables below include financial measures of operating income and diluted earnings per share excluding restructuring charges in 2009 and the benefit of a significant tax accrual in 2010 there were no adjustments to 2011 financial results these are all nongaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles we believe this nongaap information is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends as of november 30 2009 our restructuring program was completed 

in 2010 our discrete tax benefits included a 139 million reversal of a tax accrual for a closed tax year this tax accrual was recorded in a prior period based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions related to the reorganization of our european operations and divestment of certain of our joint ventures we are treating this 139 million discrete tax benefit as a nongaap adjustment to our diluted earnings per share we are providing nongaap results that exclude the impact of this reversal as the item to which it relates was recorded as a restructuring charge and it allows for a better comparison of 2010 financial results to the prior year and 2011 

these nongaap measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we intend to continue to provide these nongaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these nongaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap financial results is provided below 

 

 liquidity and financial condition 

 

 we generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives make share repurchases when appropriate increase our dividend and fund capital projects in 2012 we expect to further pay down our debt incurred to fund 2011 acquisitions and resume our share repurchase activity in the absence of any acquisition activity 

in the cash flow statement the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as these do not reflect actual cash flows accordingly the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet 

  

the reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our nonus subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods at november 30 2011 the exchange rates for the euro australian dollar and british pound sterling were slightly higher versus the us dollar compared to 2010 exchange rate fluctuations resulted in increases to trade accounts receivable of 4 million inventory of 3 million goodwill of 19 million and other comprehensive income of 4 million since november 30 2010 

operating cash flow – when 2011 is compared to 2010 the decrease in operating cash flow was driven by a higher level of inventory in 2011 as compared to last year as we have moved into a higher cost environment we have increased our strategic inventory positions in a number of spices and herbs crops that do not have hedging options other than outright purchase in addition to these higher levels of raw material the cost of our raw material inventory has increased which increased the dollar value of our inventory acquisitions in 2011 have also added to a higher level of inventory in summary about one third of the inventory increase was due to strategic positions one third due to the cost impact and about 15 related to acquisitions these uses of operating cash were partially offset by a higher level of cash generated from improved net income in 2011 our total pension contributions were 427 million in 2011 as compared to 495 million in 2010 

when 2010 is compared to 2009 the decrease in operating cash flow was driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable these were partially offset by a higher level of cash generated from improved net income and lower pension contributions in 2010 our total pension contributions were 495 million in 2010 as compared to 723 million in 2009 

in addition to operating cash flow we also use cash conversion cycle ccc to measure our working capital management this metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures ccc is a calculation of the number of days on average that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources such as raw materials to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable our goal is to lower our ccc over time we calculate ccc as follows 

days sales outstanding average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales plus days in inventory average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold less days payable outstanding average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory 

the following table outlines our cash conversion cycle in days over the last three years 

 

 the increase in ccc from 2010 to 2011 is largely due to an increase in our days in inventory the decrease in ccc from 2009 to 2010 is mainly due to lower days sales outstanding in the future we expect to reduce ccc by decreasing our days in inventory as a result of a new inventory management system and related processes 

investing cash flow – the changes in cash used in investing activities from 2009 to 2011 were primarily due to fluctuations in cash used for acquisition of businesses and joint venture interests in 2011 and 2010 with no acquisitions in 2009 we invested 4414 million and 469 million in acquisitions and joint venture interests in 2011 and 2010 respectively see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of these acquisitions capital expenditures were 967 million in 2011 890 million in 2010 and 824 million in 2009 we expect 2012 capital expenditures to be in line with depreciation and amortization expense 

financing cash flow – the change in cash flow used in financing activities in 2011 when compared to 2010 is primarily due to an increase in net borrowings in 2011 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due 2021 with net cash proceeds received of 2475 million the net proceeds from this offering were used to fund in part 

  

our acquisition of kamis in 2011 we also increased our shortterm borrowings by 2167 million and repaid 1000 million in longterm debt in 2010 and 2009 we repaid borrowings of 1140 million and 2522 million respectively in 2010 we repaid shortterm borrowings of 996 million and repaid 144 million in longterm debt in 2009 we repaid 504 million of longterm debt as it became due and repaid shortterm borrowings of 2018 million 

the following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs in millions 

 

 in june 2010 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program to purchase up to 400 million of our outstanding shares in september 2010 we completed a 400 million share repurchase program authorized by the board in june 2005 as of november 30 2011 270 million remained of the new share repurchase program there were no shares repurchased during 2009 as we were continuing to repay debt incurred with the lawry’s and billy bee acquisitions 

the common stock issued in 2011 2010 and 2009 relates to our stock compensation plans 

our dividend history over the past three years is as follows 

 

 in november 2011 the board of directors approved a 107 increase in the quarterly dividend from 028 to 031 per share during the past five years dividends per share have risen at a compound annual rate of 91 

 

 the changes in the debttocapital ratio from 2009 to 2011 are mainly due to changes in our debt in conjunction with acquisition activity and subsequent pay downs of that debt in 2008 we acquired lawry’s and billy bee during 2009 and 2010 the debt associated with these acquisitions was greatly reduced in 2011 we increased our debt levels to help fund our kamis kohinoor and kitchen basics acquisitions 

most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations capital projects and future acquisitions at yearend we temporarily used 1386 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down shortterm debt in the us the average shortterm borrowings outstanding for the years ended november 30 2011 and 2010 were 3440 million and 3763 million respectively the total average debt outstanding for the years ended november 30 2011 and 2010 was 12615 million and 12372 million respectively 

in may and june 2011 we entered into a total of 200 million of forward us treasury rate lock agreements to manage the us treasury portion of our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in july 2011 we cash settled all of these agreements which were designated as cash flow hedges for a loss of 02 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an all in effective fixed rate of 401 on the full 250 million of debt the loss on these agreements is deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements was not material see notes 5 and 6 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions 

credit and capital markets – credit market conditions were volatile during 2009 but improved in 2010 during 2011 several countries within the european union experienced sovereign debt and credit 

  

issues this has caused more volatility in the credit and economic environment throughout the european union the following summarizes the more significant impacts on our business 

credit facilities – cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth dividends and capital expenditures in the second half of 2010 and in the first half of 2011 we also used this cash to make share repurchases in 2009 and the first half of 2010 we used operating cash flow to pay down debt incurred in the lawry’s acquisition and did not repurchase shares in the second half of 2011 we used operating cash flow to help fund our 2011 acquisitions of kamis kohinoor and kitchen basics we also rely on our revolving credit facility or borrowings backed by this facility to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements our major revolving credit facility has a total committed capacity of 600 million which expires in 2016 we generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper if the commercial paper market is not available or viable we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility the facility is made available by a syndicate of banks with various commitments per bank if any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital in addition to our committed revolving credit facility we have uncommitted credit facilities for 546 million as of november 30 2011 we engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facility during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition we periodically review our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities we believe our banks will perform on their commitments see also note 5 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements we believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations 

pension assets – we hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan cash payments to pension plans including unfunded plans were 427 million in 2011 495 million in 2010 and 723 million in 2009 it is expected that the 2012 total pension plan contributions will be approximately 60 million future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets we base our investment of plan assets in part on the duration of each plan’s liabilities across all plans approximately 67 of assets are invested in equities 28 in fixed income investments and 5 in other investments see also note 8 of the financial statements which provides details on our pension funding 

customers and counterparties – see the subsequent section of this mda under market risk sensitivity–credit risk 

acquisitions 

acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits we have a particular interest in emerging markets 

in 2011 we purchased the assets of kitchen basics inc based in the us for 40 million and the shares of kamis sa based in poland for 287 million both deals are consumer businesses and were financed with a combination of cash and debt we also completed a joint venture with kohinoor foods ltd in india we invested 113 million for an 85 interest in kohinoor speciality foods india private limited financed with a combination of cash and debt this joint venture will be consolidated and included in our consumer business segment 

these three acquisitions added 526 million to sales and we recorded 109 million in transactionrelated expenses in 2011 the impact on earnings per share exclusive of the transaction related expenses was immaterial as profit from these three acquisitions was largely offset by costs to integrate these businesses these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings per share in 2012 

  

in 2010 we purchased a 26 noncontrolling interest in eastern condiments private limited eastern based in india for 377 million in cash we also purchased the assets of a consumer business in north america that sells mexican food items for 115 million in cash 

see note 2 of the financial statements for further details of these acquisitions 

performance graph—shareholder return 

below is a line graph comparing the yearly change in mccormick’s cumulative total shareholder return stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends on mccormick’s nonvoting common stock with 1 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s 500 stock price index assuming reinvestment of dividends and 2 the cumulative total return of the standard  poor’s packaged foods  meats index assuming reinvestment of dividends 

market risk sensitivity 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures which exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument the use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 5 and 6 of the financial statements 

foreign exchange risk – we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar polish zloty australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi indian rupee swiss franc thai baht and the british pound sterling versus the euro we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks 

during 2011 the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in france the uk canada and australia we did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 

  

the following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at november 30 2011 all contracts are valued in us dollars using yearend 2011 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures firm commitments or anticipated transactions 

foreign currency exchange contracts at november 30 2011 

 

 we have a number of smaller contracts with an aggregate notional value of 46 million to purchase or sell other currencies such as the swiss franc and the singapore dollar as of november 30 2011 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 01 million at november 30 2011 

included in the table above are 477 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than 7 days that are used to hedge shortterm cash flow funding remaining contracts have durations of one to twelve months 

at november 30 2010 we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar and thai baht with a notional value of 2082 million the majority of which matured in 2011 the aggregate fair value of these contracts was 26 million at november 30 2010 

interest rate risk – our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt the table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees by fiscal year of maturity at november 30 2011 and 2010 for foreign currencydenominated debt the information is presented in us dollar equivalents variable interest rates are based on the weightedaverage rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented 

  

year of maturity at november 30 2011 

 

 year of maturity at november 30 2010 

 

 the table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees interest rate swaps have the following effects the fixed interest rate on 100 million of the 520 notes due in 2015 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015 net interest payments are based on 3 month libor minus 005 during this period we issued 250 million of 575 notes due in 2017 in december 2007 forward treasury lock agreements of 150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 625 we issued 250 million of 525 notes due in 2013 in september 2008 forward treasury lock agreements of 100 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 554 we issued 250 million of 390 notes due in 2021 in july 2011 forward treasury lock agreements of 200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full 250 million of notes at a weightedaverage fixed rate of 401 

commodity risk – we purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather market conditions growing and harvesting conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control our most significant raw materials are dairy products pepper garlic onion capsicums red peppers and paprika soybean oil and wheat while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk to the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose it has not been material to our business 

credit risk – the customers of our consumer business are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers consolidations in these industries have created larger customers in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers dollar stores warehouse clubs and discount chains this has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged we continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value we consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of november 30 2011 

contractual cash obligations due by year 

 

   

   in 2012 our pension and postretirement contributions are expected to be approximately 60 million pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets as a result we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above 

commercial commitments expiration by year 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of november 30 2011 and 2010 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations see note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts 

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

in preparing the financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenue and expense amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us including information about contingencies risk and financial condition we believe given current facts and circumstances our estimates and assumptions are reasonable adhere to us gaap and are consistently applied inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise in preparing the financial statements we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable inventory fixed assets and prepaid allowances our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas 

customer contracts 

in several of our major geographic markets the consumer business sells our products by entering into annual or multiyear customer contracts these contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts marketing allowances and performance incentives these items are expensed based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending we routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change 

goodwill and intangible asset valuation 

we review the carrying value of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below we also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows 

  

riskadjusted discount rates assumed royalty rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

goodwill impairment 

our reporting units are the same as our operating segments we calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate we then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit including intangible assets and goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value as of november 30 2011 we had 16942 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet 15507 million in the consumer segment and 1435 million in the industrial segment our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 

indefinitelived intangible asset impairment 

our indefinitelived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks we calculate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model or relieffromroyalty method and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible asset as of november 30 2011 we had 2770 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their estimated fair values we intend to continue to support our brand names 

below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of november 30 2011 

 

 based on preliminary purchase price allocations at november 30 2011 

income taxes 

we estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return at the end of each year an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year a reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate income tax expense for 2011 includes 26 million of adjustments from the reconciliation of prior year tax estimates to actual tax filings we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the us gaap guidance for uncertainty in income taxes we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions including related interest is adequate the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows management has recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in doing so management has considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates 

  

pension and postretirement benefits 

pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates investment returns projected salary increases mortality rates and health care cost trend rates the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results a 1 increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2012 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately 16 million a 1 increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2012 pension expense by approximately 7 million in addition see the preceding sections of mda and note 8 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of our stockbased compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock dividend yield and riskfree interest rate our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 9 of the financial statements

raw materials 

the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper capsicums onion wheat soybean oil and garlic pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the united states other raw materials like cheese and onion are primarily sourced from within the united states we are not aware of any government restrictions or other factors that would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials because the raw materials are agricultural products they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions and other factors beyond our control we respond to this volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments

trademarks licenses and patents 

mccormick owns a number of trademark registrations although in the aggregate these trademarks may be material to our business the loss of any one of those trademarks with the exception of our “mccormick” “lawry’s” “zatarain’s” “club house” “ducros” “schwartz” and “vahine” trademarks would not have a material adverse effect on our business the “mc  mccormick” trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the us and certain nonus markets the terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful 

we have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and nonaffiliated entities the loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business the term of the license agreements is generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties 

we also own various patents none of which individually are viewed as material to our business 

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in mccormick’s business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter mccormick usually builds its inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 “financing arrangements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 43 and 44 of our annual report to stockholders for 2010 and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 24 through 27 of our annual report to stockholders for 2010 

competition 

mccormick competes in a geographic market that is international and highly competitive our strategies for competing in each of our segments include a focus on price and value product quality and innovation and superior service additionally in the consumer segment we focus on brand recognition and loyalty effective advertising promotional programs and the identification and satisfaction of consumer preferences for further discussion see pages 16 through 18 of our annual report to stockholders for 2010 

research and development 

many of mccormick’s products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by our research laboratories and product development teams as well as from in some cases customer proprietary formulas expenditures for research and development were 527 million in 2010 489 million in 2009 and 510 million in 2008 the amount spent on customersponsored research activities is not material to us 

environmental regulations 

the cost of compliance with federal state and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on mccormick’s business there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2010 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2011 

employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including the risks described below the risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that we face if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance increase in private label use by customers or consumers or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact us 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law we also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brand through effective marketing and other measures a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brand which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of branded and private label product offerings if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label it could have a significant impact on our consumer business 

the food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged we also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness a product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could cause consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients and otherwise have a negative effect on our business and financial results negative publicity about these concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our reputation or brands 

the consolidation of customers may put pressures on our operating margins and profitability 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the us the european union and other major markets such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying 

  

power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability 

issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper capsicums onion wheat soybean oil and garlic while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield political unrest in the producing countries changes in governmental agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

further political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities in developing countries create risks for food safety although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 

food products are extensively regulated in many of the countries in which we sell our products the company is subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the manufacture storage marketing advertising and distribution of food products including laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements the environment relations with distributors and retailers employment health and safety and trade practices enforcement of existing laws and regulations changes in legal requirements andor evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations financial or otherwise that could adversely affect the company’s business andor financial results 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

a natural disaster such as an earthquake fire flood or severe storm or a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack an epidemic affecting our operating activities major facilities or employees’ and customers’ health or a computer system failure could cause an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory andor data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner or at all in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that an earthquake natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 

we may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these potential acquisitions and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including 

  

diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2010 39 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the british pound sterling versus the euro and the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi and thai baht we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of approximately 02 million at an average interest rate of approximately 88 on november 30 2010 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements the company engages in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition management periodically reviews our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities management believes the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time if at all our inability to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise could cause or increase an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other 

  

corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity

seasonality 

due to seasonal factors inherent in mccormick’s business our sales income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season this seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns primarily in the consumer segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter mccormick usually builds its inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year we generally finance working capital items inventory and receivables through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of our liquidity and capital resources see note 6 “financing arrangements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 48 and 49 of our annual report to stockholders for 2009 and the “liquidity and financial condition” section of “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 27 through 30 of our annual report to stockholders for 2009

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or common stock nonvoting you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including the risks described below the risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that we face if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name loss of brand relevance or increase in private label use by customers or consumers could negatively impact us 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law we also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brand through effective marketing and other measures a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brand which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations from time to time our customers evaluate their mix of branded and private label product offerings if a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label it could have a significant impact on our consumer business 

the consolidation of customers may put pressures on our operating margins and profitability 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the us the european union and other major markets such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability 

  

issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products pepper wheat onion capsicums soybean oil and garlic while future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield political unrest in the producing countries changes in governmental agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

further political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities in developing countries create risks for food safety although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

a natural disaster such as an earthquake fire flood or severe storm or a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack an epidemic affecting our operating activities major facilities or employees’ and customers’ health or a computer system failure could cause an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory andor data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner or at all in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner 

  

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that an earthquake natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 

we may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these potential acquisitions and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2009 38 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with us and foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the british pound sterling versus the euro and the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi and thai baht we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

  

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of approximately 1012 million at an average interest rate of approximately 04 on november 30 2009 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements the company engages in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities during these communications none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments in addition management periodically reviews our banking and financing relationships considering the stability of the institutions pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships based on these communications and our monitoring activities management believes the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote 

in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time if at all our inability to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

we face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our us nonqualified pension plan deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise could cause or increase an 

  

underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy our common stock or nonvoting common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including the risks described below the risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that we face if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

damage to our reputation or brand name or loss of brand relevance due to increased private label use by consumers could negatively impact us 

our reputation for manufacturing highquality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law we also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brand through effective marketing and other measures a serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures deterioration of our quality image impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brand which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us 

our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control the most significant raw materials used by us in our business are cheese pepper soybean oil wheat capsicums onion and garlic while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments we have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

in addition we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield political unrest in the producing countries changes in governmental agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control therefore we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

further political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities in developing countries create risks for food safety although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business financial condition or operating results

our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets 

the food industry is intensely competitive competition in our product categories is based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases 

our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters business interruptions or similar events 

a natural disaster such as an earthquake fire flood or severe storm or a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack an epidemic affecting our operating activities major facilities or employees’ and customers’ health or a computer system failure could cause an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory andor data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner or at all in addition some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather a major storm heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner 

we cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing in the event that an earthquake natural disaster terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner our business financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 

we may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we may acquire other businesses and based on an evaluation of our business portfolio divest existing businesses these potential acquisitions and divestitures may present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from existing businesses difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers in addition we may be required to incur asset impairment charges including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce its profitability for example as reported on the form 8k filed by us on november 25 2008 we recorded a noncash impairment charge representing a reduction in the value of our silvo brand which was acquired by us in 2004 if we are unable to consummate such transactions or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected

our failure to successfully integrate the recently purchased assets of the lawry’s business into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results 

on july 31 2008 we completed our previously announced purchase from conopco inc an indirect subsidiary of unilever nv of specified assets used in connection with the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of food products under the “lawry’s” and “adolph’s ® ” brands as previously announced the terms of the order from the federal trade commission for the acquisition required the sale of our seasonall business and in accordance with these terms on july 31 2008 we completed the sale of our seasonall business to morton international inc there may be risks or costs resulting from the lawry’s acquisition that are not presently known to us various factors may be necessary for us to achieve our objectives with respect to the acquisition andor avoid increases in the costs associated with the acquisition including continued customer acceptance of the lawry’s and adolph’s product lines the successful integration of the lawry’s business into our business and the completion of transition services agreements with conopco inc for the lawry’s business and with morton international inc for the seasonall business 

our foreign operations are subject to additional risks 

we operate our business and market our products internationally in fiscal year 2008 42 of our sales were generated in foreign countries our foreign operations are subject to additional risks including fluctuations in currency values foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies compliance with foreign laws enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties additionally international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could adversely affect our profitability 

fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas cash flows related to raw material purchases the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments primary exposures include the us dollar versus the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar australian dollar mexican peso chinese renminbi and thai baht we routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing foreign currency risks however these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes therefore we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business financial position or operating results

the consolidation of customers may put pressures on our operating margins and profitability 

our customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the us the european union and other major markets such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories resisting price increases demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products these factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability 

increases in interest rates may negatively impact us 

we had total outstanding shortterm borrowings of approximately 3031 million at an average interest rate of approximately 21 on november 30 2008 our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements we also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt we utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations we do not enter into contracts for trading purposes nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines however our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates therefore we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business financial position or operating results 

the deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding 

we rely on our revolving credit facilities or borrowings backed by these facilities to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes if any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments our liquidity could be impacted which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements in addition global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time if at all our inability to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us could have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

  

 8  

we face risks associated with certain pension obligations 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans a deterioration in the value of plan assets driven by a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from general financial downturn or otherwise could cause or increase an underfunded status of our primary defined benefit pension plan thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plan for example from november 2007 to november 2008 our primary us defined benefit pension plan moved from an overfunded to underfunded status driven by decreased plan asset values resulting from the global financial turndown an obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

the global financial downturn exposes us to credit risks from customers and counterparties 

consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged in addition competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk current credit markets are highly volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following are certain risk factors that could affect the registrant’s business financial condition and results of operations these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forwardlooking statements before you buy the registrant’s common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including the risks described below the risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that the registrant faces if any of the risks actually occur the registrant’s business financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected in that case the trading price of the registrant’s securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

damage to the registrant’s reputation or brand name could negatively impact the registrant 

  

the registrant’s reputation for manufacturing high quality products is widely recognized in order to safeguard that reputation the registrant has adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with law the registrant also continually makes efforts to increase its brand awareness and relevance and to maintain and improve relationships with its customers and consumers a serious breach of the registrant’s quality assurance or quality control procedures or deterioration of its quality image or impairment of its customer or consumer relationships could have a material negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations 

  

issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact the registrant 

  

the registrant’s purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond the registrant’s control the most significant raw materials are cheese pepper soybean oil wheat sweeteners capsicums garlic and onion while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain the registrant seeks to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments the registrant has not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate the registrant’s exposure to changes in raw material prices therefore the registrant cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on its business financial condition or operating results 

  

in addition the registrant may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield political unrest in the producing countries changes in governmental agricultural programs and other factors beyond the registrant’s control therefore the registrant cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on its business financial condition or operating results 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

further political socioeconomic and cultural conditions as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities in developing countries create risks for food safety although the registrant has adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of its imported products the registrant cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on its business financial condition or operating results 

  

the registrant’s profitability may suffer as a result of competition in its markets
