general business and industry risks 

the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business  we have grown rapidly over the last several years through acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to us 

• managing our distribution channel partners and enduser customers 

• managing our contract manufacturing and supply chain 

• manufacturing an increased number of products 

• developing and managing custom solutions offerings 

• managing parties to whom we have outsourced portions of our business operations 

• managing administrative and operational burdens 

• managing stakeholder interests including customer investor and employee social responsibility matters 

• maintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth 

• managing the integration of acquisitions 

• managing logistical problems common to complex expansive operations 

• managing our international operations and 

• attracting developing and retaining individuals with the requisite technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and solutions 

inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price our ability to expand revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results we may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services products or solutions an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us the process of integrating any acquired business technology service product or solution into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including but not limited to 

• difficulties and uncertainties in retaining the customers distributors vendors or other business relationships from the acquired entities 

• the loss of key employees of acquired entities 

• disruptions in our business due to difficulties integrating and reorganizing operations products technologies and personnel 

• the ability of acquired entities to fulfill their customers’ obligations 

• the inheritance of known and the discovery of unknown issues or liabilities 

• preclosing and postclosing acquisitionrelated earnings charges could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from period to period 

• the failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected operating results or cash flows could result in impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired 

• the ability to implement internal controls and accounting systems necessary to be compliant with requirements applicable to public companies subject to sec reporting which could result in misstated financial reports and 

• future acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and goodwill impairment charges 

the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products and solutions as well as introducing new products solutions and services to address user demands 

the company’s industry is characterized by 

• evolving industry standards 

• frequent new product solution and service introductions 

• evolving distribution channels 

• increasing demand for customized product and software solutions 

• changing customer demands and 

• changing security protocols 

future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

the company participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements the markets that we serve are rapidly evolving and highly competitive some of our products solutions and services are in direct competition with similar or alternative products solutions and services provided by our competitors in addition we often compete with local competitors that may have a substantial advantage in attracting customers in their countries due to more established branding in that country greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of customers residing in that country or their focus on a single market because of the potential for consolidation in any market such competitors may become larger and increased size could permit them to operate in wider geographic areas to remain competitive we believe we must continue to effectively and economically 

• identify and evolve with customer needs emerging technologies and industry trends 

• monitor disruptive technologies and business models 

• innovate develop and timely commercialize new technologies solutions and services 

• competitively price our products solutions and services 

• offer superior customer service

we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or technologies current or future competitors are likely to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products solutions and services that could cause a decline in market acceptance of our products solutions or services or result in the loss of major customers increased competition in our industry may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support in addition we may not be able to effectively anticipate and react to new entrants in the marketplace competing with our products solutions or services 

further as we expand into markets beyond our core products we may face well established competitors placing us at a disadvantage in a new competitive landscape some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products and solutions which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace an inability to compete successfully could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

operational risks 

the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products solutions and services outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from suppliers located outside the us many of whom with operations concentrated in china shipments to nonus customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales we also expect to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

• fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales increase costs of purchasing and affect collection of receivables outside of the us 

• volatility in foreign credit markets may affect the financial wellbeing of our customers and suppliers 

• violations of anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act could result in large fines and penalties 

• adverse changes in or uncertainty of local business laws or practices including the following 

• imposition of burdensome tariffs quotas taxes trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 

• restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 

• political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our nonus assets at risk 

• limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringement on our products or may cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 

• staffing may be difficult including higher than anticipated turnover 

• a governmentcontrolled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of currencies including the chinese yuan 

• transportation delays and customs related delays may affect production and distribution of our products 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil could negatively affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

• effectively managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters and 

• integration and enforcement of laws varies significantly among jurisdictions and may change over time 

third parties may allege that the company or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights periodically third parties claim that we or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights as we continue to expand our business and incorporate new technologies into our products and solutions these types of claims may increase any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel to the extent a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right is established we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and we may be required to pay costly judgments or settlements enter into costly licensing arrangements or use a noninfringing method to accomplish our business objectives any of which could have a negative impact on our operating margins see item 3 legal proceedings for additional information regarding current patent litigation 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation and our competitive position may be materially damaged our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages we use copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information we regard as trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of the company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use thirdparty andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products and solutions such parties ceasing continued development of the operating systems or restricting our access to such operating systems could adversely impact our business and financial results we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating systems and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices our financial results could be negatively impacted by a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage us 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations we rely on information technology systems throughout the company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to distributors and customers maintain confidential and proprietary information and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email the company stores confidential and proprietary information 

through cloudbased services that are hosted by third parties where we have less influence over security protocols in addition our customers may use certain of our products and solutions to transmit andor process personal data and other sensitive information like many companies we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we periodically perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection implement and manage disaster recovery testing and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information despite our implementation of a variety of security controls and measures as well as those of our thirdparty vendors there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident further as cybercrime and threats continue to rapidly evolve and become increasingly more difficult to detect and defend against our current security controls and measures may not be effective in preventing cybersecurity incidents and we may not have the capabilities to detect certain vulnerabilities a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption phishing and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

cybersecurity incidents can take a variety of forms including unintentional events as well as deliberate attacks by individuals groups and sophisticated organizations such as state sponsored organizations or nationstate actors further certain of our third party vendors have limited access to our employee and customer data and may use this data in unauthorized ways any such cybersecurity incident or misuse of our employees’ or customers’ data may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at the company if our core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data any failure on the part of us or our thirdparty service providers to maintain the security of data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings private litigation with potentially large costs deterioration in our suppliers’ distributors’ and customers’ confidence in us as well as other competitive disadvantages such failures to maintain the security of data could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach 

any threats or security breaches to our systems may negatively impact our customers our products and solutions that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in disclosure of a customer’s confidential information or disrupt the availability of the customer’s data and systems further our customers may fail to adopt adequate security controls and measures or may fail to timely update their products and solutions to install or enable security patches which may result in a security breach the market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our reputation could also be harmed as a result of any actual or perceived security breach that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products the systems of other vendors or to actions of malicious parties it is possible that such a breach or a perceived breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products solutions or services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages to date we have had no material incidents related to the security of our products or solutions further strategic customers may negotiate specific controls and we may incur additional costs to comply with such customerspecific controls although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient 

we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects we have been subject to product liability claims and may continue to be subject to such claims including claims for property or economic damages or personal injury where damages arose and may continue to arise from our products as a result of actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects in addition such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by thirdparty suppliers we seek to limit such risk through insurance protection as well as product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers although there have been no material claims todate at the company due to the growing size of the company’s installed product base and growing number of applications in which our products can be used an actual or alleged design or manufacturing defect could result in product recalls injury to our reputation and customer service costs or legal costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results 

defects or errors in the company’s software products could harm our reputation result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market such products our software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner any future errors defects or bugs found in our software 

products and related services may result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products solutions or services diversion of resources injury to reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our business success depends on our ability to attract retain develop and motivate key personnel our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by increased competition for highly skilled employees higher employee turnover or increased compensation and benefit costs the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of key personnel including senior management and other highly skilled employees the experience industry knowledge and skill sets of our employees materially benefit our operations and performance and the ability to attract retain develop and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our longterm success skilled employees in our industry are in high demand and competition for their experience and skill sets is intense the incentives and benefits we have available to attract retain and motivate employees may become less effective as employees seek new or different opportunities based on factors such as compensation benefits mobility and flexibility that are different from what we offer although we strive to be an employer of choice we may not be able to continue to successfully attract retain develop or motivate key personnel in the future any disruption in the services of key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a natural disaster widespread public health issue civil unrest or manmade disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations natural disasters or widespread public health issues including pandemics may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the company’s operations and facilities are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility following an interruption to our business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected the consequences of a natural disaster or widespread public health issue may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have and may continue to adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations the coronavirus “covid19” pandemic has been and continues to be complex and rapidly evolving and has impacted our business most recently primarily related to supply chain disruption including higher fulfillment costs and component shortages and labor constraints the duration and extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of covid19 the emergence of new variants of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment actions the extent to which vaccines andor other medical treatments are developed and made available to and accepted by the public and the impact of these and other factors on our stakeholders 

the us federal state and local governments as well as nonus governments to varying degrees have imposed and continue to impose several protocols and regulations restricting activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid19 over the course of the pandemic we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and suppliers including having the majority of office workers work remotely during the height of the pandemic and gradually returning to offices as restrictions are lifted limiting employee travel and implementing more strenuous health and safety measures for hosting and attending inperson industry events as governments ease their restrictions we have been allowing and will continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach with modified business practices including implementing social distancing protocols consistent with government regulations vaccine verification health screening office capacity restrictions and tracking and tracing protocols where applicable provision of personal protective equipment increasing air exchangeventilation and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces however there is no guarantee that such protocols will be successful in preventing the spread of covid19 amongst our employees and even as employees return to our offices we may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time the extent and duration of ongoing workplace restrictions and limitations particularly in sites with significant headcount could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute on strategic imperatives for our business moreover vaccine and testing mandates have been announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate as a company under us occupational safety and health administration “osha” jurisdiction we must comply with osha covid19 mandates such as the emergency temporary standard “ets” that was announced on november 5 2021 but currently remains in flux and under review by the courts as to final implementation and compliance our implementation of these mandates and any future mandates may result in employee attrition including attrition of critically skilled labor and may cause difficulty in attracting and retaining talent necessary for our business operations and securing future labor needs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the potential negative effects to our operations including reductions in production levels 

research and development activities and increased efforts to mitigate the impact of covid19 may adversely affect our ability to deliver our products solutions and services 

further the conditions caused by covid19 have affected and may continue to affect the overall demand environment for our products solutions and services the level of demand for certain product components has resulted in and may continue to result in lengthened lead times and higher input costs including freight this has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to meet customer demand as well as profitability an inability to meet customer demand may also adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products solutions or services additionally our financial results may be adversely impacted by challenges in the macroeconomic environment including market inflation as a result of global supply chain shortages 

if covid19 or its variants become more prevalent in the locations where our customers suppliers or we conduct business we may experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected moreover the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may exacerbate other preexisting risks such as global economic conditions political regulatory social financial operational and cybersecurity as well as similar risks relating to our suppliers and customers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business we enter into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers that expose us to risks including among others i technological risks especially when contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the accuracy of estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cybersecurity risks especially in solutions or managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of frontloaded costs incurred on longterm managed services and softwarebased solutions contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we enter into fixedprice contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs if our initial cost estimates are incorrect we can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and our use of subcontractors has and may continue to increase as we expand our global solutions and services business our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software we may have disputes with our subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by a subcontractor and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by a subcontractor we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from our subcontractors our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners we are not able to directly control certain business operations that we outsource our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases our outsource partners’ actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations such as import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results further we have from timetotime and in certain instances will continue to transition our outsourced operations to new service providers andor to different geographies such transition activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies as well as insourcing activities could 

result in additional cost time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition which could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business it is our policy to require suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations including those regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the company’s products and solutions and expose us to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of our products services and solutions and their failure to effectively bring our products services and solutions to market may negatively affect our results of operation and financial results in addition to our own sales force we offer our products services and solutions through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers who may also market other products services and solutions that compete with ours failure of one or more of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote our offerings could affect our ability to bring products services and solutions to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations any changes to our channel program may cause some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure which may reduce our ability to bring products and solutions to market and could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products and solutions from other thirdparties or from us directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain of our products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers we may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shutdown may adversely affect our business results because we rely on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products we may incur increased business continuity risks we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products if these thirdparty manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming we have taken actions to diversify and may take additional actions to diversify in the future our product sourcing footprint such actions have and may again result in additional costs 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers we source some of our components from sole source suppliers any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies inclusive of transportation costs could have a negative impact on our results of operations our ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from our suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for our products solutions or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters public health issues severe weather conditions or financial issues we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future at times we have and may continue to execute multiyear purchase commitments with suppliers that contain minimum spend thresholds which we are obligated to fulfill even if customer demand declines in addition volatility in customer demand product availability and costs to transport products may result in increased operating input costs also credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us impacting our cash flow 

in addition our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer 

financial and market risks 

the impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the united states and corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance the company currently imports a significant percentage of our products into the us and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company’s financial performance although the company has taken actions to diversify its product sourcing footprint these efforts may not be sufficient to mitigate negative impacts on the company’s financial performance resulting from an increase in customs duties 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves we are subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination disposition or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions many countries have recently adopted or are considering the adoption of revisions to their respective tax laws based on the ongoing reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd”g20 base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the us our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may negatively impact our business general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products solutions or services by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products solutions and services negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro british pound sterling and czech koruna could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk we have many types of insurance coverage and are also selfinsured for some risks and obligations our thirdparty insurance coverage varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance in addition our thirdparty insurance policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis further certain types of coverages may be difficult or expensive to obtain we selfinsure against certain 

business risks and expenses where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available if the amount of our thirdparty insurance coverage is not available or adequate to cover all claims or liabilities or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business our indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

• we may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness 

• our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired 

• we may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for or responding to changing conditions in the industry including increased competition and 

• we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business 

we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we may not be able to effect any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness 

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of “interest expense net” if not hedged the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase we would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swaps may introduce additional volatility to our operating results 

legal and regulatory risks 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition business acquisition purchase price allocations impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company as part of our operations the company collects uses stores and transfers personal data of third parties employees and limited customer data in and across various jurisdictions laws and regulations relating to the handling of such personal 

data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company existing laws and emerging regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing sometimes conflicting interpretations government officials regulators and privacy advocates are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data which may result in new interpretations of existing laws that impact our business compliance with these laws may require us to among other things make changes in services business practices or internal systems that may result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms further there is no assurance that we will be able to meet additional requirements that may be imposed on the transfer of personal data without incurring expenses we may experience reluctance or refusal by customers to purchase or continue to use our services due to concerns regarding their data protection obligations our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing may subject the company to enforcement actions and regulatory investigations claims legal proceedings or other actions reputational harm and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from time to time we are a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results

recent developments 

covid19 outbreak 

the global coronavirus “covid19” pandemic continues to be complex and rapidly evolving governmental agencies to varying degrees have imposed and continue to impose several protocols and regulations restricting activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid19 we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect our employees’ health and wellbeing over the course of the pandemic tailored to address the local impacts including having the majority of office workers work remotely during the height of the pandemic and gradually returning to offices as restrictions are lifted 

limiting employee travel and implementing more strenuous health and safety measures for hosting and attending inperson industry events throughout the pandemic distribution centers and repair centers have remained open at varying capacity levels to ensure continued support to our customers many of whom provide essential goods and services to communities as governments ease their restrictions we have been allowing and will continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach with modified business practices including masking and social distancing protocols consistent with government regulations vaccine verification health screening office capacity restrictions and tracking and tracing protocols where applicable provision of personal protective equipment increasing air exchangeventilation and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces 

the negative impacts to net sales from the pandemic including declines in customer demand and impacts of operational closures within our supply chain were most pronounced in the first half of 2020 and lessened later in 2020 as the global economic recovery took shape while the ultimate duration of the pandemic and timing of recovery in each region remains highly uncertain the company’s 2021 sales and profitability particularly in the first half of the year have benefited from pentup demand from customers who we believe had delayed purchases in 2020 due to the pandemic as well as the resulting acceleration of the underlying trend to digitize and automate workflows the level of demand for certain product components has resulted in lengthened lead times and higher input costs in 2021 including freight which have become more significant during the second half of 2021 and in some cases have impacted our ability to meet customer demand the company expects input costs to remain elevated for some period of time which we believe will be partially mitigated through higher pricing where permitted by market conditions the availability of certain component parts has and may continue to negatively impact our ability to meet forecasted customer demand as suppliers of necessary parts allocate supply among their customers including the company

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of our revenues cash collections from our customers cash payments to our suppliers capital expenditures repatriation of foreign cash acquisitions and share repurchases management believes that our existing capital resources inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated in millions 



2021 vs 2020 

the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following 

• the increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher operating income lower inventory levels and lower employee incentive compensation payments these benefits were partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances reflecting the timing of customer transactions within the period higher income tax payments as well as reduced benefits from our accounts receivable factoring programs 

• the decrease in cash used in investing activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions the current year includes cash payments for the acquisitions of antuit fetch and adaptive vision whereas the prior year includes a cash payment for the acquisition of reflexis 

• the increase in net cash used in financing activities during the current year was primarily due to higher net debt repayments as well as higher payments related to sharebased compensation plans in the current year which were partially offset by lower share repurchases the prior year included a net source of cash associated with the timing of factored receivables servicing activities

future cash requirements 

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents which totaled 332 million as of december 31 2021 along with anticipated cash generation from operations and available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities will be sufficient to fund the company’s cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter based on our current business plans 

included in the company’s cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries which was 39 million and 37 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we do not expect that cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries will need to be repatriated in order to fund the company’s us operations based on current cash requirements 

our cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter include payments to satisfy the following obligations 

• purchase obligations — we generally procure inventories and other goods and services through purchase orders at levels to satisfy our operational needs for 12 months or less we have a limited number of multiyear inventory and servicerelated purchase commitments which contain minimum purchase requirements and are noncancellable as of december 31 2021 these commitments were approximately 360 million relating to the next five years excluding amounts already reflected within accounts payable or accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet see note 14 accrued liabilities commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 

• debt obligations — we expect to make total payments of approximately 101 million associated with the company’s debt facilities in 2022 this expected use of cash is based on the company’s current borrowings and applicable interest rates and margins as of december 31 2021 and includes principal and interest payments along with expected cash settlements associated with the company’s interest rate swaps in the ordinary course of business the company may decide to borrow additional amounts or repay principal earlier than contractually owed which would affect future cash payments see note 12 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details related to the company’s debt facilities

critical accounting estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the company under accounting principles generally accepted in the us the application of these principles requires the use of estimates which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements while we believe that our estimates are reasonable based upon available information actual results may substantially differ from those estimates note 2 significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional discussion of these items along with other significant accounting policies of the company the accounting estimates described below have been identified by management as those that are most critical to our financial statements as they require management to make significant judgments and assumptions about inherently uncertain and complex matters

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting this method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the estimates used to determine the fair values of longlived intangible assets can be complex and require judgment we generally value intangible assets using incomebased valuation methodologies such as the excess earnings method which require a number of critical estimates that include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from revenues and operating activities and the determination of discount rates 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill impairment testing consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value fair value determinations require judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates as well as market factors we estimate the fair value of reporting units using both income and marketbased valuation approaches the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit including projected future operating results and cash flows and the determination of discount rates the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from a comparable industry group estimating the fair value of reporting units also requires that we make a number of assumptions and estimates regarding our longterm growth and cash flow expectations as well as overall industry and economic conditions these estimates and assumptions include but are not limited to projections of revenue and income growth rates capital investments competitive and customer trends appropriate peer group selection marketbased discount rates and other market factors our annual quantitative impairment test most recently completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 continues to indicate that the fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceed their respective carrying values 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods solutions or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive the consideration that we expect to receive is estimated by reflecting reductions to our transaction price for product returns rebates and other incentives these estimates are developed using the expected value that the company anticipates receiving and are based on recent trends observed in similar transactions additionally many of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations including various hardware software andor services for such contracts that contain multiple performance obligations we allocate the estimated total transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices “ssp” the determination of ssp is established at a regional level ssp is based on observable prices in recent standalone transactions for the same or similar offerings to the extent available which is often applicable to tangible products and software licenses alternatively in the absence of recent observable prices the company generally applies the expected costplus margin approach to professional services repair and maintenance services and solution offerings there were no changes to our estimation processes for consideration received or ssp that materially affected revenues during the year

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency changes zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk interest rate and foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances our exposures include the london interbank offered rate “libor” and the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate swaps to mitigate the majority of the company’s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these interest rate swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange floatingrate for fixedrate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced in 2017 the phase out of libor we continue to closely monitor the phase out of libor to assess any impacts to our debt and interest rate swap contracts we have already taken actions to amend certain contracts to incorporate a sofr benchmark rate and we expect other key contracts will be amended to incorporate a sofr benchmark rate before the libor phase out is completed as of december 31 2021 our remaining contracts containing exposure to libor pertain only to libor tenors that will be phased out by june 30 2023 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 10 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 2 million this exposure includes the impact of associated forward interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2021 refer to note 11 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease to the extent that the company’s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease respectively 

foreign exchange risk 

we provide products solutions and services in approximately 180 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates in some instances we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments including foreign currency exchange contracts see note 11 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of hedging activities 

the currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the euro british pound sterling and czech koruna a one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the us dollar would increase or decrease our pretax income by approximately 2 million this amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts

regulatory matters 

wireless regulatory matters 

our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters 

the use of wireless voice data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world in the us the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” regulate spectrum use by nonfederal entities and federal entities respectively similarly countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies these include voice and data infrastructure mobile radios and portable or handheld devices consequently our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from timetotime by the fcc ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and consequently the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed 

other regulatory matters 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites certain products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products during 2020 compliance with us federal state and local and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects these risks are not the only risks we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial no priority or significance is intended by nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

general business and industry risks 

the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business  we have grown rapidly over the last several years through acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to us 

• managing our distribution channel partners 

• managing our contract manufacturing and supply chain 

• manufacturing an increased number of products 

• developing and managing custom solutions offerings 

• managing parties to whom we have outsourced portions of our business operations 

• managing administrative and operational burdens 

• managing stakeholder interests including customer investor and employee social responsibility matters 

• maintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth 

• managing the integration of acquisitions 

• managing logistical problems common to complex expansive operations 

• managing our international operations and 

• attracting developing and retaining individuals with the requisite technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and solutions 

inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price our ability to expand revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results we may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services products or solutions an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 

• difficulties and uncertainties in retaining the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entities 

• the loss of key employees of acquired entities 

• the ability of acquired entities to fulfill their customers’ obligations 

• the inheritance of known and the discovery of unknown issues or liabilities 

• preclosing and postclosing acquisitionrelated earnings charges could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from period to period 

• the failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected operating results or cash flows could result in impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired 

• the ability to implement internal controls and accounting systems necessary to be compliant with requirements applicable to public companies subject to sec reporting which could result in misstated financial reports and 

• future acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and goodwill impairment charges 

the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products and solutions as well as introducing new products solutions and services to address user demands 

the company’s industry is characterized by 

• evolving industry standards 

• frequent new product solution and service introductions 

• evolving distribution channels 

• increasing demand for customized product and software solutions 

• changing customer demands and 

• changing security protocols 

future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

the company participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions to remain competitive we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide 

• technologically advanced systems that satisfy user demands 

• superior customer service 

• high levels of quality and reliability and 

• dependable and efficient distribution networks 

we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or technologies increased competition in mobile computing products data capture products radio frequency identification devices “rfid” printers supplies or softwarebased solutions may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products and solutions which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace 

operational risks 

the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products solutions and services outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from suppliers located outside the us shipments to nonus customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales we also expect to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

• fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales increase costs of purchasing and affect collection of receivables outside of the us 

• volatility in foreign credit markets may affect the financial wellbeing of our customers and suppliers 

• violations of anticorruption laws including the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act could result in large fines and penalties 

• adverse changes in or uncertainty of local business laws or practices including the following 

• imposition of burdensome tariffs quotas taxes trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 

• restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 

• political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our nonus assets at risk 

• limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringement on our products or may cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 

• staffing may be difficult including higher than anticipated turnover 

• a governmentcontrolled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of currencies including the chinese yuan 

• transportation delays and customs related delays may affect production and distribution of our products 

• geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil could negatively affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

• effectively managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters and 

• integration and enforcement of laws varies significantly among jurisdictions and may change over time 

third parties may allege that the company or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights periodically third parties claim that we or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights as we continue to expand our business and incorporate new technologies into our products and solutions these types of claims may increase any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel to the extent a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right is established we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and we may be required to pay costly judgments or settlements enter into costly licensing arrangements or use a noninfringing method to accomplish our business objectives any of which could have a negative impact on our operating margins 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation and our competitive position may be materially damaged our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages we use copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information we regard as trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of the company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use thirdparty andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products and solutions such parties ceasing continued development of the operating systems or restricting our access to such operating systems could adversely impact our business and financial results we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating systems and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices our financial results could be negatively impacted by a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage us 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations we rely on information technology systems throughout the company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to distributors and customers maintain confidential and proprietary information and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email like many companies we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we periodically perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection implement and manage disaster recovery testing and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information despite our implementation of a variety of security measures there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption phishing and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

a cybersecurity incident including deliberate attacks and unintentional events may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at the company if our core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data any failure on the part of us or our thirdparty service providers to maintain the security of data we are required to protect including 

via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our suppliers’ distributors’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach 

our products and solutions that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products solutions or services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages to date we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products or solutions although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient 

we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects we may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damages or personal injury in the event damages arise from our products as a result of actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by thirdparty suppliers we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and seek to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the growing size of the company’s installed product base and growing number of applications in which our products can be used an actual or alleged design or manufacturing defect could result in product recalls customer service costs or legal costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results 

defects or errors in the company’s software products could harm our reputation result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market such products our software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner any future errors defects or bugs found in our software products and related services may result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products solutions or services diversion of resources injury to reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of senior management and other key personnel the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a natural disaster widespread public health issue civil unrest or manmade disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations natural disasters or widespread public health issues including pandemics may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the company’s operations and facilities are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility following an interruption to our business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected the consequences of a natural disaster or widespread public health issue may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have and may continue to adversely affect our business financial results and results of operations the coronavirus “covid19” has spread rapidly worldwide resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain the spread of covid19 globally such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns the covid19 pandemic has been and continues to be complex and rapidly evolving and has adversely impacted our business primarily related to lower customer demand and higher fulfillment costs the duration and extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the severity and transmission rate of covid19 the extent and effectiveness of containment actions the extent to which vaccines andor other medical treatments are developed and made available to the 

public and the impact of these and other factors on our employees customers industry partners suppliers and third party dealers distributors and resellers 

the federal state and local governments as well as foreign governments to varying degrees have imposed and continue to impose several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid19 we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and suppliers including having the majority of office workers work remotely limiting employee travel and withdrawing from industry events the transition to working remotely for most of our office employees may impact our business operations customer relationships pose additional data security risks as well as impact our ability to attract and retain talent the extent and duration of ongoing workplace restrictions and limitations particularly in sites with significant headcount could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute on strategic imperatives for our business as governments ease their restrictions and we allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach we have modified our business practices including implementing social distancing protocols office capacity restrictions health screening provision of personal protective equipment tracking and tracing protocols and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces however there is no guarantee that such protocols will be successful in preventing the spread of covid19 amongst our employees in late 2020 certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of covid19 and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment at this time the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain further we have experienced higher than normal employee absentee rates for employees who are unable to work from home and even as employees return to our offices we may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time the potential negative effects to our operations including reductions in production levels research and development activities and increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid19 may adversely affect our ability to deliver our products solutions and services 

in addition the continued spread of covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the worldwide credit and financial markets which could limit our ability to obtain external financing and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults adversely affecting our liquidity while the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date the duration and severity of any further economic or market impact of the pandemic remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources including our ability to access capital markets in the future 

if covid19 becomes more prevalent in the locations where our customers suppliers or we conduct business we may experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected moreover the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may exacerbate other preexisting risks such as global economic conditions political regulatory social financial operational and cybersecurity as well as similar risks relating to our suppliers and customers any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

zebra could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union z ebra maintains its european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the uk and has significant operations and sales throughout europe including its regional distribution center located in heerenveen netherlands following the uk formally withdrawing from the eu on january 31 2020 the uk and eu entered into a transition period that ended on december 31 2020 the euuk trade and cooperation agreement was entered into on december 24 2020 and details the future relationship between the uk and eu and has resolved much uncertainty nevertheless effective january 1 2021 customs borders are in place between great britain and northern ireland and great britain and the eu which could adversely impact zebra’s operations and financial performance due to the increase in importation requirements that may lead to disrupted or delayed shipments in the region such disrupted or delayed shipments may also result in shortages of products and components or loss of customer confidence which could affect zebra’s financial performance 

we are exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business we enter into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers that expose us to risks including among others i technological risks especially when contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the accuracy of estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cybersecurity risks especially in solutions or managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of frontloaded costs incurred on longterm managed services and softwarebased solutions contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we enter into fixedprice contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs if our initial cost estimates are incorrect we can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new 

technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and our use of subcontractors has and may continue to increase as we expand our global solutions and services business our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software we may have disputes with our subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by a subcontractor and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by a subcontractor we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from our subcontractors our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners we are not able to directly control certain business operations that we outsource our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases our outsource partners’ actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations such as import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results additionally transitioning activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies as well as insourcing activities could result in additional cost time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition which could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business it is our policy to require suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations including those regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the company’s products and solutions and expose us to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of our products and solutions and their failure to effectively bring our products and solutions to market may negatively affect our results of operation and financial results in addition to our own sales force we offer our products and solutions through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers who may also market other products and solutions that compete with ours failure of one or more of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote our products and solutions could affect our ability to bring products and solutions to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations any changes to our channel program may cause some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure which may reduce our ability to bring products and solutions to market and could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products and solutions from other thirdparties or from us directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain of our products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers we may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shutdown may adversely affect our business results because we rely on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products we may incur increased business continuity risks we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products if these thirdparty manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming from time to time we may diversify our product sourcing footprint similar to the actions we took with our efforts to reduce our reliance on chinesebased manufacturing which may result in additional costs 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers we source some of our components from sole source suppliers any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations our ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from our suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for our products solutions or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters public health issues severe weather conditions or financial issues we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us impacting our cash flow 

in addition our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer 

financial and market risks 

the impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the united states and corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance the company currently imports a significant percentage of our products into the us and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company’s financial performance during 2020 the company successfully completed efforts to diversify its product sourcing footprint in order to reduce its reliance on chinesebased manufacturing and mitigate the impacts of related customs duties 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves we are subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination disposition or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions many countries have recently adopted or are considering the adoption of revisions to their respective tax laws based on the ongoing reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and 

development “oecd”g20 base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the us our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may negatively impact our business general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products solutions or services by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products solutions and services negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro british pound sterling czech koruna brazilian real and chinese yuan could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk we have many types of insurance coverage and are also selfinsured for some risks and obligations our thirdparty insurance coverage varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain thirdparty insurance in addition our thirdparty insurance policies are subject to deductibles policy limits and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis further certain types of coverages may be difficult or expensive to obtain we selfinsure against certain business risks and expenses where we believe we can adequately selfinsure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed costeffective or is not available if the amount of our thirdparty insurance coverage is not available or adequate to cover all claims or liabilities or to the extent we have elected to selfinsure we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business as of december 31 2020 we had 13 billion of outstanding debt gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs our indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

• we may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness 

• our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired 

• we may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for or responding to changing conditions in the industry including increased competition and 

• we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business 

we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we may not be able to effect any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants 

which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness 

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of “other net” if not hedged the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase we would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swaps introduce additional volatility to our operating results 

legal and regulatory risks 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment business acquisition purchase price allocations impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company as part of our operations the company collects uses stores and transfers personal data of third parties employees and limited customer data in and across various jurisdictions laws and regulations relating to the handling of such personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company existing laws and emerging regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing sometimes conflicting interpretations government officials regulators and privacy advocates are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data which may result in new interpretations of existing laws that impact our business compliance with these laws may require us to among other things make changes in services business practices or internal systems that may result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms further there is no assurance that we will be able to meet additional requirements that may be imposed on the transfer of personal data without incurring expenses we may experience reluctance or refusal by customers to purchase or continue to use our services due to concerns regarding their data protection obligations our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing may subject the company to enforcement actions and regulatory investigations claims legal proceedings or other actions reputational harm and loss of goodwill any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and business 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from time to time we are a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 

we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws our operations and the products we manufacture andor sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws and regulations compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities restrict what products solutions and services we can offer and generally impact our financial performance some of 

these laws are environmental and relate to the use disposal remediation emission and discharge of and exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance 

laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories recycling of both electronic products and packaging reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products standardization of connectors and power supplies the transportation of lithiumion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety radio interference radio frequency radiation exposure medical related functionality and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment these laws and changes to these laws could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products solutions and services and on what capabilities and characteristics our products solutions or services can or must include 

these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products increasing energy efficiency and providing additional accessibility

the company’s operations consist of two reportable segments asset intelligence  tracking “ait” and enterprise visibility  mobility “evm” 

• the ait segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies its major product lines include barcode and card printers supplies services location solutions and retail solutions industries served include retail and ecommerce transportation and logistics manufacturing healthcare and other end markets within the following regions north america europe middle east and africa “emea” asiapacific and latin america 

• the evm segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions its major product lines include mobile computing data capture rfid services and workflow optimization solutions industries served include retail and ecommerce transportation and logistics manufacturing healthcare and other end markets within the following regions north america emea asiapacific and latin america 

beginning in the first quarter of 2021 we will move the retail solutions product line from our ait segment into our evm segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business we will begin reporting our results reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2021 and will present historical periods on a comparable basis the impact of this change does not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements and is immaterial to our current and historical reportable segment results 

recent developments 

covid19 outbreak 

in 2020 the coronavirus “covid19” spread rapidly worldwide resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain it such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these events have resulted in significant declines in global economic activity and significant volatility in financial market valuations the duration and extent of which continues to be highly uncertain the company’s 2020 net sales and profitability were negatively impacted by the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic which were most pronounced in the second quarter 

we serve a diverse mix of customers some of our customers have experienced significant declines or suspensions to their operations whereas others have experienced increases in their business volume while many of our supply chain partners in china temporarily suspended or modified their business operations in early 2020 as a consequence of covid19 we have 

substantially mitigated the impact of these disruptions by taking exceptional actions including alternative modes of product delivery and fulfillment as well as providing protective equipment and hazard pay premiums for our frontline employees 

the federal state and local governments as well as foreign governments to varying degrees have imposed and continue to impose several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of covid19 we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect our employees’ health and wellbeing including having the majority of office workers work remotely limiting employee travel and withdrawing from inperson industry events in addition as governments continue to ease their restrictions and we continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach we have modified our business practices including implementing social distancing protocols office capacity restrictions health screening provision of personal protective equipment tracking and tracing protocols and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces throughout the pandemic distribution centers and repair centers have remained open at varying capacity levels to ensure continued support to our customers many of whom provide essential goods and services to communities 

during the past year we considered the potential impacts of the global pandemic in qualitative impairment assessments of our longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets property plant and equipment and rightofuse lease assets we concluded that it is not more likely than not that any of our longlived assets are impaired our analysis considered among other factors 

• the nature of our products solutions and services as well as our position within our industry 

• our highly variable cost structure 

• the assumption that the negative impacts from covid19 will be temporary and that 

• the company will continue generating strong positive operating cash flows over the longterm 

we have also considered the adequacy of our capital resources inclusive of available borrowing capacity and other financing facilities the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment assessment which was last completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and further discussed in note 6 goodwill and other intangibles in the notes to consolidated financial statements and that our market capitalization has continued to far exceed total net assets finally while we may experience a temporary increase in working capital levels we do not anticipate a material impact to the realizability of current assets such as accounts receivable or inventories at this time 

the situation related to the pandemic continues to be complex and rapidly evolving in late 2020 certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of covid19 and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment at this time however the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain if covid19 persists or worsens before a safe and effective vaccine or other treatment is made widely available there may be further external developments such as restrictions imposed by government authorities or guidance issued by public health authorities that are beyond our control and may impact our operating plans parts of our business have experienced and may continue to experience operational disruption and customer demand impacts since the onset of the pandemic we have taken certain cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact to profitability and cash flow we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its longterm impact to our business

2020 compared to 2019 

total net sales decreased 37 million or 08 compared with the prior year primarily due to customer demand declines resulting from the covid19 pandemic which had an overall negative effect on both of our segments and broadly across all regions the negative effect of the pandemic was most pronounced within our ait segment particularly in the second quarter of 2020 ait sales declines were partially offset by growth in our evm segment reflecting higher services and software revenues due in part from recent business acquisitions as well as increased product purchases particularly in the transportation and logistics and retail end markets in response to the need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly ondemand economy excluding the effects of acquisitions and unfavorable currency changes the decrease in consolidated organic net sales was 09 

gross margin decreased to 450 for the current year compared to 468 in the prior year gross margins were lower in both the ait and evm segments reflecting unfavorable business mix including larger deal size and premium freight costs these declines were partially offset by productivity gains within our services offerings and a partial recovery of 2019 chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020 

operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 were 1352 million and 1408 million or 304 and 314 of net sales respectively as a percentage of net sales operating costs continue to trend favorably the decrease in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to lower discretionary spending employee incentivebased compensation and intangible asset amortization expense these reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of operating expenses associated with acquired businesses and costs associated with the diversification of the company’s product sourcing footprint 

operating income was 651 million for the current year compared to 692 million for the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower net sales and gross profit partially offset by the benefit of lower operating expenses 

net income decreased 74 compared to the prior year due to lower operating income and higher income tax expense which were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses net detailed as follows 

• the company’s effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 were 100 and 90 respectively the company’s effective tax rate was higher in the current year as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher benefits of uncertain tax positions in the prior year partially offset by higher income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in the current year 

• other expenses net was 91 million for the current year compared to 94 million for the prior year the increase in interest rate swap and foreign exchange losses in the current year were more than offset by the favorable impacts of lower interest rates and average outstanding debt levels additionally the prior year included 7 million of debt refinancing costs 

diluted earnings per share decreased to 935 as compared to 997 in the prior year primarily due to lower operating income and a higher effective income tax rate which were partially offset by the benefit of lower weighted average shares outstanding

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency changes zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk interest rate and foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include the london interbank offered rate “libor” we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate swaps to mitigate the majority of the company’s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange floatingrate for fixedrate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor we continue to closely monitor the possible phase out of libor to assess any impacts to our debt and interest rate swap contracts including the necessity to amend any of those contracts in order to incorporate alternative reference rates 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 13 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 5 million this exposure includes the impact of associated forward interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2020 refer to note 11 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease to the extent that the company’s borrowings under its revolving credit facility or receivables financing facilities increase or decrease respectively 

foreign exchange risk 

we provide products solutions and services in approximately 180 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates in some instances we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments including foreign currency exchange contracts see note 11 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of hedging activities 

the currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the euro british pound sterling czech koruna brazilian real and chinese yuan a one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the us dollar would increase or decrease our pretax income by approximately 2 million this amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secrets patents trademarks copyrights and contractual rights to establish and protect our innovations and hold a large portfolio of intellectual property rights in the us and other countries as of december 31 2019  the company owned approximately 2200 trademark registrations and trademark applications and over 4900 patents and patent applications worldwide we continue to actively seek to obtain patents and trademarks whenever possible and practical to secure intellectual property rights in our innovations 

we believe that our intellectual property will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage for future technologies we also believe that we are not dependent upon any single patent or select group of patents our success depends more upon our extensive knowhow deep understanding of enduser processes and workflows innovative culture technical leadership and marketing and sales abilities although we do not rely only on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position we will enforce our intellectual property rights when and where appropriate 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  the company had approximately 8200 employees some portions of our business primarily in europe china and india are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from those in the us in europe for example it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation benefits restructurings and layoffs we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 

regulatory matters 

wireless regulatory matters 

our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters 

the use of wireless voice data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world in the us the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” regulate spectrum use by nonfederal entities and federal entities respectively similarly countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies these include voice and data infrastructure mobile radios and portable or handheld devices consequently our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from timetotime by the fcc ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and consequently the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed 

other regulatory matters 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites certain products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products during 2019  compliance with us federal state and local and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

risk factors 

tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in this report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects these risks are not the only risks we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial no priority or significance is intended by nor should be attached to the order in which the risk factors appear 

general business and industry risks 

the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business  we have grown rapidly over the last several years through acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price our ability to expand revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results we may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 



the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

the company’s industry is characterized by 

 future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

the company participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions to remain competitive we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide 

 we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or technologies increased competition in mobile computing products data capture products radio frequency identification devices “rfid” printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace 

operational risks 

the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from suppliers located outside the us shipments to nonus customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales we also expect to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 



 infringement by the company or our suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that we or our suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a thirdparty’s patent or other intellectual property right we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish our objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result our products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation and our competitive position may be materially damaged our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages we use copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information we regard as trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of the company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use thirdparty andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products such parties ceasing continued development of the operating systems or restricting our access to such operating systems could adversely impact our business and financial results we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating systems and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices our financial results could be negatively impacted by a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage us 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations we rely on information technology systems throughout the company to keep financial records process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to distributors and customers maintain confidential and proprietary information and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity network communications and email like many companies we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we periodically perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection implement and manage disaster recovery testing and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information despite our implementation of a variety of security measures there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption phishing and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

a cybersecurity incident including deliberate attacks and unintentional events may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at the company if our core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data any failure on the part of us or our thirdparty service providers to maintain the security of data we are required to protect including 

via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also result in deterioration in our suppliers’ distributors’ and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach 

our products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages to date we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient 

we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects we may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damages or personal injury in the event damages arise from our products as a result of actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by thirdparty suppliers we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and seek to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the growing size of the company’s installed product base and growing number of applications in which our products can be used an actual or alleged design or manufacturing defect could result in product recalls customer service costs or legal costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results 

defects or errors in the company’s software products could harm our reputation result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market such products our software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner any future errors defects or bugs found in our software products and related services may result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of resources injury to reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of senior management and other key personnel the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a natural disaster widespread public health issue or manmade disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations natural disasters or widespread public health issues may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the company’s operations and facilities are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility following an interruption to our business the company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales if such a disruption were to occur we could breach agreements our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected the consequences of a natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

zebra could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union zebra maintains its european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the uk and has significant operations and sales throughout europe on january 31 2020 the uk formally withdrew from the eu after withdrawal the uk and eu entered into a transition period that is due to end on december 31 2020 during this transition period the uk will negotiate the terms of its future relationship with the eu since the uk’s referendum in june 2016 to withdraw from the eu markets have been more volatile including fluctuations in the british pound that could adversely impact zebra’s operating costs in the uk such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact zebra’s sales in the uk and throughout europe our european business involves cross border transactions between the uk and the eu the future trade relationship between the uk and the eu could adversely impact zebra’s operations in the region by increasing importation requirements or disrupting shipments between the eu to the uk or vice versa the terms of the uk’s 

withdrawal from the eu and resulting impacts to zebra’s operations are currently uncertain and could adversely affect the company’s financial performance 

we are exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business we enter into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers that expose us to risks including among others i technological risks especially when contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the accuracy of estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cybersecurity risks especially in managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of frontloaded costs incurred on longterm managed services contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we enter into fixedprice contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs if our initial cost estimates are incorrect we can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and our use of subcontractors has and may continue to increase as we expand our global solutions and services business our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software we may have disputes with our subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by a subcontractor and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by a subcontractor we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from our subcontractors our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners we are not able to directly control certain business operations that we outsource our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases our outsource partners’ actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations such as import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results additionally transitioning activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies as well as insourcing activities could result in additional cost time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition which could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business it is our policy to require suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations including those regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the company’s products and expose us to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of our products and their failure to effectively bring our products to market may negatively affect our results of operation and financial results in addition to our own sales force we offer our products through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers who may also market other products that compete with our products failure of one or more of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote our products could affect our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations any changes to our channel program may cause some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure which may reduce our ability to bring products to market and could have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products from other thirdparties or from us directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain of our products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers we may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shutdown may adversely affect our business results because we rely on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products we may incur increased business continuity risks we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products if these thirdparty manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming from time to time we may diversify our product sourcing footprint similar to the actions we are currently taking with our efforts to reduce our reliance on chinesebased manufacturing which may result in additional costs 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers we source some of our components from sole source suppliers any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations our ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from our suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters public health issues severe weather conditions or financial issues we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us impacting our cash flow 

in addition our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer 

financial and market risks 

the impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the united states and corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance the us government has imposed customs duties on various imports from china that are intended to address trade imbalances these actions will result in increased customs duties and will likely result in the renegotiation of some us trade agreements in response to such actions china has instituted customs duties on certain us goods other governments could also institute customs duties on us goods similar to china’s actions in response to the us government’s customs duties the company currently imports a significant percentage of our products into the us and china and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company’s financial performance the company commenced efforts to diversify its product sourcing footprint in order to reduce its reliance on chinesebased manufacturing and mitigate the impacts of related customs duties failure to effectively manage transition activities associated with product sourcing diversification may negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance such customs duties also may cause the us’ trading partners other than 

china to take actions with respect to us imports or us investment activities in their respective countries any potential changes in trade policies in the us and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect the company’s financial performance 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves we are subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination disposition or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions many countries have recently adopted or are considering the adoption of revisions to their respective tax laws based on the ongoing reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd”g20 base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the us our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may negatively impact our business general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk we have many types of insurance coverage and are also selfinsured for some risks and obligations while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain such as professional liability insurance which is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers as we grow our global solutions and services business we are being asked to obtain higher amounts of professional liability insurance which could result in higher costs to do business natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims professional liability and public liability are potential selfinsured events that could negatively impact our financial results in addition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business as of december 31 2019 we had 13 billion of outstanding debt gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs our indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we may not be able to effect any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness 

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of “other net” if not hedged the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase we would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swaps introduce additional volatility to our operating results 

legal and regulatory risks 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment business acquisition purchase price allocations impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company as part of our operations the company collects uses stores and transfers personal data of third parties and employees in and across various jurisdictions the governing bodies in such jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use transfer storage and disclosure of personal data obtained from third parties and employees for example the general data protection regulation effective may 2018 these laws may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the collection use storage transfer and disclosure of our thirdparty and employee personal data compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in 

increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in claims against the company or significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations from time to time we are a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 

we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws our operations and the products we manufacture andor sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws and regulations compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities restrict what products and services we can offer and generally impact our financial performance some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use disposal remediation emission and discharge of and exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance 

laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories recycling of both electronic products and packaging reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products standardization of connectors and power supplies the transportation of lithiumion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety radio interference radio frequency radiation exposure medical related functionality and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment these laws and changes to these laws could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products solutions and services and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include 

these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products increasing energy efficiency and providing additional accessibility

impact of us tax reform 

enacted on december 22 2017 the tax cut and jobs act “the act” reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred based on current operations the company is subject to the global intangible lowtaxed income base erosion antiavoidance tax and the deduction for foreignderived intangible income provisions of the act for which we recorded income tax expense of 12 million and 10 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively we are not currently subject to the new limitations which defer us interest deductions in excess of 30 of adjusted taxable income however the application of the interest limitation may apply in the future depending on changes in the company’s business model additionally the company is no longer able to deduct performancebased compensation for its covered employees which 

exceeds the limitation under amended internal revenue code section 162m these impacts are included in the calculation of the company’s effective tax rate 

during 2017 the company provisionally recognized an income tax expense of 72 million associated with the act comprised of a onetime transition tax of 37 million and 35 million remeasurement of its net us deferred tax assets based on the federal statutory rate of 21 

during 2018 the company finalized its analysis of the act including the onetime transition tax and measurement of net deferred tax assets and recorded a 3 million income tax benefit as a result of differences between its final analysis and provisional analysis from the prior year the final analysis included both federal and state tax effects based on legislative pronouncements through december 31 2018 the company also utilized a total of 28 million of available net operating losses research and development credits alternative minimum tax credits and foreign tax credits in order to substantially reduce its cash payments for the onetime transition tax 

during 2019 there were no retroactive law changes that impacted the 2018 reassessment 

see note 16  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

other developments 

in 2019 the company incurred 5 million related to efforts to diversify its product sourcing footprint to include sourcing products from taiwan vietnam and malaysia thereby reducing its reliance on chinesebased manufacturing and the impacts of related customs duties “tariffs” on us imports from china these costs are primarily reflected within operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations the company anticipates incurring additional onetime operating costs of up to 25 million by the middle of fiscal year 2020 as well as incremental equipment purchases of approximately 10 million to 15 million as a result of these actions along with certain us pricing actions and based on current economic and operating conditions the company expects to substantially mitigate the ongoing financial impacts of chinese tariffs 

in december 2019 a strain of the coronavirus surfaced in wuhan china in january 2020 a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts commenced to contain the spread of the virus in china as a result many of our supply chain partners in china temporarily suspended or modified their business operations beyond the normal chinese lunar new year shutdown as of february 10 2020 operations have resumed to varying degrees at many of our supply chain partners the situation is complex and rapidlyevolving we are not yet able to fully ascertain its impact on our results of operations either with respect to its impact on our manufacturing operations in china or with respect to its impact on our sales to customers in china our current expectation is the coronavirus outbreak could have a negative impact to our sales of between 0 and 50 million this expectation is based solely on facts as we understand them to be today the impact could be significantly greater if the coronavirus outbreak were to develop in a manner that is significantly worse than our current expectations

2019 vs 2018 

the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency changes zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk interest rates and foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include the london interbank offered rate “libor” from time to time we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate swaps to mitigate our exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange floatingrate for fixedrate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 some of the company’s contracts with respect to its borrowings and interest rate swap contracts already contain comparable alternative reference rates that would automatically take effect upon the phasing out of libor for certain other contracts that do not already contain sufficient alternative reference rate provisions the company anticipates negotiating comparable replacement reference rates with its counterparties 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 13 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 5 million  this exposure includes the impact of associated forward interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2019  refer to note 11  derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease to the extent that the company’s borrowings under its revolving credit facility or receivables financing facilities increase or decrease respectively 

foreign exchange risk 

we provide products and services in approximately 180 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 11  derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of hedging activities 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the euro british pound sterling czech koruna brazilian real and chinese yuan a one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the us dollar would increase or decrease our pretax income by approximately 1 million  this amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the consolidated balance sheets of certain entities with exposures denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are typically one month in maturity and are not designated as hedges

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secrets patents trademarks copyrights and contractual rights to establish and protect our innovations and hold a large portfolio of intellectual property rights in the us and other countries as of december 31 2018  the company owned approximately 1800  trademark registrations and trademark applications and over 4400  patents and patent applications worldwide we continue to actively seek to obtain patents and trademarks whenever possible and practical to secure intellectual property rights in our innovations 

we believe that our intellectual property will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage for future technologies we also believe that we are not dependent upon any single patent or select group of patents our success depends more upon our extensive knowhow deep understanding of enduser processes and workflows innovative culture technical leadership and marketing and sales abilities although we do not rely only on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position we will enforce our intellectual property rights when and where appropriate 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  the company had approximately 7400  employees some portions of our business primarily in europe china and india are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from those in the us in europe for example it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation benefits restructurings and layoffs we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 

regulatory matters 

wireless regulatory matters 

our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters 

the use of wireless voice data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world in the us the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” regulate spectrum use by nonfederal entities and federal entities respectively similarly countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies these include voice and data infrastructure mobile radios and portable or handheld devices consequently our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from timetotime by the fcc ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and consequently the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed 

other regulatory matters 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites certain products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products during 2018  compliance with us federal state and local and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

risk factors 

tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects these risks are not the only risks we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from suppliers located outside the us shipments to nonus customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales we also expect to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change  to be successful we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

the company’s industry is characterized by 

  

 future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

the company participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements  we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions to remain competitive we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide 

  



 we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in mobile computing products data capture products printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace 

the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business  we have grown rapidly over the last several years through acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to us 

  

 inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price  our ability to expand revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results  we may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 

  

 infringement by the company or our suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly  third parties may claim that we or our suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a thirdparty’s patent or other intellectual property right we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to 

use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish our objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result our products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation and our competitive position may be materially damaged  our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages we use copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information which we regard as trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and incurring substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of the company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use thirdparty andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products such parties ceasing continued development of the operating system or restricting our access to such operating system could adversely impact our business and financial results  we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating system and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices as a result our financial results could be negatively impacted because a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage us 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations  like many companies we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we periodically perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection implement and manage disaster recovery testing and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption “phishing” and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

a cybersecurity incident including deliberate attacks and unintentional events may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at the company if our core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems andor data 

our products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages to date we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company  as part of our operations the company collects uses stores and transfers personal data of third parties and employees in and across jurisdictions the governing bodies in such jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting 

laws and regulations regarding the collection use transfer storage and disclosure of personal data obtained from third parties and employees for example general data protection regulation effective may 2018 these laws may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the collection use storage transfer and disclosure of our thirdparty and employee personal data compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in claims against the company or significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  we may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by thirdparty suppliers we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seek to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of the company’s installed product base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed product base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results 

defects or errors in the company’s software products could harm our reputation result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market such products  our software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner it is possible that errors defects or bugs will be found in our existing or future software products and related services with the possible results of delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel  the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect the company’s stock price operations and profitability  the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets since then a number of significant acts of terrorism have occurred and war continues in the middle east all of which may contribute to instability in financial markets additional acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect our facilities and operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

the impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the united states and corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance the us government has imposed customs duties on various imports from china that are intended to address trade imbalances these actions will result in increased customs duties and will likely result in the renegotiation of some us trade agreements in response to such actions china has instituted customs duties on certain us goods other governments could also institute customs duties on us goods similar to china’s actions in response to the us government’s customs duties the company imports a significant percentage of our products into the us and china and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company’s financial performance based on the current products affected we do not anticipate such increase in customs duties to materially impact the company’s financial performance such customs duties also may cause the us’ trading partners other than china to take actions with respect to us imports or us investment activities in their respective countries any potential changes in trade policies in the us and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect the company’s financial performance 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves  we are subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates  forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination disposition or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions many countries have recently adopted or are considering the adoption of revisions to their respective tax laws based on the ongoing reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd”g20 base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the us our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan  and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations  natural disasters may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

zebra could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union zebra maintains its european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the uk and has significant operations and sales throughout europe the uk formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw with such notice triggering a twoyear period ending in march 2019 which could be followed by a transition period during such twoyear period the uk has been negotiating the terms of the withdrawal since the uk’s referendum in june 2016 to withdraw from the eu markets have been more volatile including fluctuations in the british pound that could adversely impact zebra’s operating costs in the uk such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact zebra’s sales in the uk and throughout europe our european business involves cross border transactions between the uk and the eu the future trade relationship between the uk and the eu could adversely impact zebra’s operations in the region by increasing importation requirements or disrupting shipments between the eu to the uk or vice versa the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and resulting impacts to zebra’s operations are currently uncertain and could adversely affect the company’s financial performance 

we are exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business we enter into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers this exposes us to risks including among others i technological risks especially when the contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cyber security risk especially in managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of frontloaded costs incurred on longterm managed services contracts with customers is dependent on the 

continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we enter into fixedprice contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs  if our initial cost estimates are incorrect we can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor  we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and as we expand our global solutions and services business our use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software we may have disputes with our subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or our subcontractors and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by our subcontractor we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from our subcontractor our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners when we outsource certain business operations we are not able to directly control these activities our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases their actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations like import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results additionally transitioning activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies as well as insourcing activities could result in additional cost time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition which could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business  it is our policy to require suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the company’s products and expose us to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of our products  in addition to our own sales force we offer our products through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers these thirdparties may also market other products that compete with our products failure of one or more of our dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote our products could affect our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations any changes to our channel program may cause some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure thereby reducing our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for third 

party dealers distributors or retailers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products from other thirdparties or from us directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain of our products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers we may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shutdown may adversely affect our business results because we rely on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products we may incur increased business continuity risks  we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products if these thirdparty manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount that we consider adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers going forward 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers we source some of our components from sole source suppliers any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations  our ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from our suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters or financial issues we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us impacting our cash flow 

in addition our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  from time to time we are a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 

it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk  we have many types of insurance coverage and are also selfinsured for some risks and obligations while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain such as professional liability insurance which is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers as we grow our global solutions and services business we are being asked to obtain higher amounts of professional liability insurance which could result in higher costs to do business natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims professional liability and public liability are potential selfinsured events that could negatively impact our financial results in addition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim 

we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws  our operations and the products we manufacture andor sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer 

worker safety and environmental laws and regulations compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities restrict what products and services we can offer and generally impact our financial performance some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use disposal remediation emission and discharge of and exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance 

laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories recycling of both electronic products and packaging reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products standardization of connectors and power supplies the transportation of lithiumion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety radio interference radio frequency radiation exposure medical related functionality and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment these laws and changes to these laws could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products solutions and services and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include 

these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products increasing energy efficiency and providing additional accessibility 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment business acquisition purchase price allocations impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business  as of december 31 2018  we had 16 billion  of outstanding debt gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs our indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  

 we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we may not be able to effect any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us 

from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness 

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of “other net” if not hedged the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase we would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swaps introduce additional volatility to our operating results

on october 27 2014 the company acquired enterprise from msi and began integration activities focused on creating “one zebra” our integration priorities centered on maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing cost synergies operating efficiencies and integration of functional organizations and processes another key focus of the integration was to exit msiprovided tsas related primarily to it systems and support services these tsas were an interim measure to continue the operations of the enterprise business without disruption while integration activities were completed the company substantially completed its integration activities in fiscal year 2017 including the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system and has exited the last tsas with msi

impact of us tax reform 

enacted on december 22 2017 the tax cut and jobs act “tcja” or “the act” reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred based on current operations the company is subject to the global intangible lowtaxed income and the deduction for foreignderived intangible income provisions collectively referred to as “gilti” of the act for which we recorded income tax expense of 10 million in 2018 we are not currently subject to the new limitations which defer us interest deductions in excess of 30 of adjusted taxable income or the base erosion antiavoidance tax “beat” however the application of the interest limitations and beat regime may apply in the future depending on changes in the company’s business model or the level of taxable income in any given year additionally the company is no longer able to deduct performancebased compensation for its covered employees which exceeds the limitation under amended internal revenue code section 162m these impacts are included in the calculation of the company’s effective tax rate 

during 2017 the company provisionally recognized an income tax expense of 72 million associated with the act comprised of onetime transition tax of 37 million and 35 million remeasurement of its net us deferred tax assets based on the federal statutory rate of 21 

during 2018 the company finalized its analysis of the act including the onetime transition tax and measurement of net deferred tax assets and recorded a 3 million income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of differences between its final analysis and provisional analysis from the prior year the final analysis included both federal and state tax effects based on legislative pronouncements through december 31 2018 the company also utilized a total of 28 million of available net operating losses research and development credits alternative minimum tax credits and foreign tax credits in order to reduce its future cash payments for the onetime transition tax resulting in a net liability for the onetime transition tax of 6 million of which 1 million has been classified as a short term liability and 5 million as a long term liability the final onetime transition tax installment payment will be made in 2024

2018  compared to 2017   

net sales increased by  496 million  or 133  compared with the prior year reflecting growth across all regions most notably north america emea and asiapacific the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales of mobile computing barcode printing and data capture products net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes primarily in the emea region as well as the inclusion of xplore consolidated organic net sales growth was 111  

gross margin increased to 470  in the current year compared to 459  in the prior year gross margin improvement was driven by higher margins in both the evm and ait segments primarily due to operational efficiencies favorable business mix as well as favorable foreign currency changes 

operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  were 14 billion  or 325  and 373  of net sales respectively as a percentage of net sales operating costs continue trending favorably primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization expense and acquisition and integration charges the lower amortization expense results from certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2017 additionally the company had lower acquisition and integration charges in the current year as the enterprise business integration activities were substantially completed during 2017 current operating costs reflect higher compensation costs which include the impact of higher incentivebased compensation associated with financial performance a 13 million pretax charge related to a legal settlement included within general and administrative expense investments to accelerate organic growth as well as the inclusion of xplore 

operating income was 610 million  for the current year compared to 322 million  for the prior year the increase was primarily due to higher net sales and gross profit as well as lower operating expenses 

total other expenses net was 86 million  for the current year compared to 234 million  for the prior year the decrease was primarily due to 81 million reduction of debt extinguishment and modification costs versus the prior year the current year also benefited from lower outstanding debt and interest rates a 10 million gain on sale of certain investments and a 6 million increase in interest rate swap gains 

the company recognized income tax expense of   103 million   and   71 million   for the years ended december 31   2018   and   2017  respectively the company’s effective tax rates were   197   and   807   as of december 31   2018   and   2017  respectively   the decrease in the effective tax rate in the current year versus the prior year is primarily due to favorable yearoveryear impacts of us tax reform changes in valuation allowances us impacts of the enterprise acquisition as well as uncertain tax benefits partially offset by the benefits of net foreign deferred tax asset remeasurements and intercompany asset transfers recorded in the prior year as well as reduced yearoveryear favorability of foreign income taxes 

2017  compared to 2016   

net sales increased by 148 million  or 41  compared with the prior year period the increase in net sales was due to higher hardware sales in north america emea and latin america offset by lower hardware sales in asiapacific the increase in hardware sales was largely attributable to increased sales of mobile computing data capture and barcode printing products partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the wlan business in october 2016 services sales were lower primarily due to the impact of the wlan divestiture organic net sales growth was 65  reflecting growth in all four geographic regions most notably in emea north america and latin america 

gross margin was 459  in both the current and prior year periods this reflects an increase in gross margin in the evm segment primarily due to changes in business mix and operational efficiencies offset by lower ait segment gross margin driven primarily by higher overhead and service costs as well as increased customer sales incentives 

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016  were 14 billion  or 373  of net sales and 16 billion  or 437  of net sales respectively the reduction in operating expenses was primarily due to impairment charges related to the disposal of the company’s wlan business in the prior year lower acquisition and integration costs and lower amortization of intangible assets during 2017 the company substantially completed its integration activities including the implementation of 

a common enterprise resource planning system associated with the enterprise acquisition the company also exited the transition service agreements with msi the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was due to certain assets reaching full amortization in 2017 exit and restructuring costs were also lower than the prior year due to the prior year including costs associated with the divestiture of the wlan business research and development costs were higher primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense associated with improved financial performance partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the wlan business general and administrative expenses were lower compared to the prior year due primarily to reduced facility and it expenses professional fees and employee benefit costs as well as the impact of the divestiture of the wlan business being offset partially by increased incentive compensation expense associated with improved financial performance 

operating income increased 242 million  compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to the decline in operating expenses as well as the increase in net sales and gross profit 

total other expenses net was 234 million  for the current year compared to 209 million  for the prior year the increase was primarily driven by 65 million of payments for early extinguishment and 16 million of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to the redemption of 11 billion senior notes in the current year partially offset by the impact of early repayments of debt and lower interest rates as well as lower longterm investment impairment charges in the current year 

the company recognized income tax expense of 71 million  and  8 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the company’s effective tax rates were 807  and 62  for the years ended december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively the increase in income tax expense in 2017 was primarily due to improvement in pretax operating results as well as the onetime unfavorable impacts of us tax reform and unfavorable changes in valuation allowances as well as uncertain tax benefits which were partially offset by the benefits of net foreign deferred tax asset remeasurements and intercompany asset transfers in 2017 as well as favorability of foreign income taxes 

results of operations by segment 

the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in note 18    segment information  geographic data  in the notes to consolidated financial statements segment results exclude purchase accounting adjustments amortization of intangible assets acquisition and integration costs impairment of goodwill and intangibles and exit and restructuring costs segment results reflect a current year revision to the company’s operating cost allocation methodologies which more accurately reflects where costs are being incurred the effect of this revision on prior periods resulted in 14 million and 41 million of operating expenses being reclassified from ait to evm for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

2018  compared to 2017   

net sales for ait increased  112 million  or 85  compared to the prior year the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales of barcode printing products being partially offset by declines in card printer sales barcode printer growth was broad based across all major product lines and led by north america asiapacific and emea regions net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes primarily in the emea region ait organic net sales growth for the year ended december 31 2018  was 70  

gross margin increased to 499  in the current year compared to 488  for the prior year the increase was primarily driven by favorable product mix operational efficiencies and the favorable impact of currency changes 

operating income for the current period increased 186  primarily due to higher net sales and gross profit partially offset by higher operating expenses 

2017  compared to 2016   

ait net sales for the year ended december 31 2017  increased 64 million  or 51  compared to the prior year the increase in net sales was largely driven by higher sales of barcode and card printers primarily in the emea and asiapacific regions sales of supplies and services were also higher than the prior year the yearonyear growth also reflects a price concession to distributors of barcode printer products imported into china in the third quarter of 2016 during 2017 no additional price concession provisions were required and a reduction of the 2016 provision was recorded due to a change in import classification for barcode printers ait organic net sales growth for the year ended december 31 2017  was 46  

gross margin was 488  compared to 497  for comparable prior year the decrease in gross margin reflects higher overhead costs including freight and costs associated with our regional distribution center transitions higher services costs and increased customer sales incentives offset partially by lower provisions for price concessions to distributors of barcode printer products imported into china 

operating income decreased 25  as higher net sales and gross profit were more than offset by higher operating expenses

2018  compared to 2017   

net sales for evm increased  381 million  or 158  compared to the prior year the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to strong global sales of mobile computing and data capture products most notably in north america emea and asiapacific regions net sales growth was also positively impacted by currency changes primarily in the emea region as well as the inclusion of xplore evm organic net sales growth was 134  

gross margin increased to 456  in the current year as compared to 444  in the prior year the increase was primarily due to favorable product mix operational efficiencies and the positive impact of currency changes

2017  compared to 2016   

evm net sales for the year ended december 31 2017  increased 77 million  or 33  compared to prior year the increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher sales of mobile computing and data capture products primarily in the north america and emea regions partially offset by impact of the divestiture of the wlan business in october 2016 evm organic net sales growth for the year ended december 31 2017  was 75  

gross margin for the year ended december 31 2017  was 444  compared to 442  in the prior year the increase in gross margin primarily reflects changes in product mix and improvements in hardware product costs 

operating income increased 229  primarily as a result of higher net sales and gross profit as well as lower operating expenses 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the company under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the application of these principles requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we believe that our estimates judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon available information our more significant estimates and assumptions include those related to the measurement and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities development of reporting unit fair values as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing and the allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in certain revenue transactions see note 2    significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these as well as other accounting policies 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 2  significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary factors that influence our liquidity include but are not limited to the amount and timing of our revenues cash collections from our customers cash payments to our suppliers capital expenditures repatriation of foreign cash and investments and acquisitions of thirdparties management believes that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated in millions 



the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance is reflective of the following 

2018  vs 2017   

cash flows from operations increased by 307 million  during 2018  to 785 million  the increase was primarily due to higher net income favorable changes in accounts payable due primarily to timing of payments and extension of contractual payment terms lower cash payments for interest and commencement of our receivables factoring program these were partially offset by unfavorable timing of accounts receivable collections 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven by the acquisition of xplore and higher capital expenditures 

net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31 2018  consisted primarily of net debt repayments of 657 million compared to 454 million during the year ended december 31 2017 the net debt repayment activities in 2017 also included 65 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the full redemption of 11 billion in debt obligations 

2017  vs 2016   

cash flows from operations increased 98 million during 2017 to 478 million this improvement was driven by an increase in net earnings of 154 million partially offset by a decline in working capital primarily related to higher inventory levels and lower accounts payable net inventory increased primarily as a result of growth in the business and changes in product mix an increased backlog level compared to the prior year and our recent transition to a new distribution model for our european operations in addition the prior year working capital benefited from the successful renegotiation of longer payment terms with vendors 

net cash used in the purchase of property plant and equipment declined 27 million as compared to the prior year as capital expenditures related to the enterprise acquisition integration were substantially completed in 2016 the prior year investing activities also included net cash proceeds of 39 million related to the sale of the wlan business 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 133 million during 2017 to 517 million the increase was primarily due to higher net debt repayments in 2017 as well as 65 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the full redemption of 11 billion in debt obligations 

company debt 

the following table shows the carrying value of the company’s debt in millions 

credit facilities 

the company’s debt includes borrowings under term loan a term loan b and a multicurrency revolving credit facility all maturing in 2021 borrowings under each instrument bear interest at a variable rate for which the company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure all borrowings under the credit facilities as of december 31 2018  were denominated in us dollars except for €92 million  under the revolving credit facility that was borrowed in euros the average interest rates as of december 31 2018  for term loan a term loan b and the revolving credit facility were 384  409  and 326  respectively the company is required to prepay certain amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions the company may make prepayments against the term loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty 

receivables financing facility 

in december 2017 the company entered into a receivables financing facility with a financial institution that has a borrowing limit of up to 180 million  which matures on november 29 2019  as collateral the company pledges a perfected firstpriority security interest in its domestically originated accounts receivables borrowings bear interest at a variable rate and are accounted for as secured borrowings as of december 31 2018  the receivables financing facility had an average interest rate of 336  and the company’s consolidated balance sheets included 459 million  of receivables that were pledged of which 139 million  had been borrowed against and reflected as a component of the current portion of longterm debt on the company’s consolidated balance sheets all borrowings under the receivable financing facility were denominated in us dollars 

both the revolving credit facility and receivables financing facility include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels as of december 31 2018  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 

see note 11  longterm debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

receivables factoring 

in addition to the company’s borrowing arrangements described above the company entered into a receivables factoring arrangement in december 2018 in order to provide additional liquidity and improve working capital under the receivables factoring arrangement the company sells certain emeaoriginated receivables to a bank in exchange for cash without maintaining a beneficial interest in the receivables sold at any time the bank’s purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum of 90 million of uncollected receivables transactions under the receivables factoring arrangement are accounted for as sales under asc 860 transfers and servicing of financial assets with related cash flows reflected in operating cash flows as of december 31 2018  33 million of uncollected receivables were sold and removed from the company’s consolidated balance sheet

included in the company’s cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries the company had 39 million  and 54 million  of foreign cash and cash equivalents included in the company’s total cash positions of 44 million  and 62 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

historically significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2019  we believe that our existing cash and investments borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables financing facility and funds available from our receivables factoring arrangement combined with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and investing activities as well as debt repayment obligation requirements for the next 12 months 

contractual obligations 

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  were as follows in millions 



 

uncertain tax benefits of 50 million  have been excluded from the above table of which 20 million  is expected to be settled in the next twelve months and is reflected as a current liability as of december 31 2018  the remainder is reflected within other longterm liabilities as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authority see note 14  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include libor rates from time to time we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange floatingrate for fixedrate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional principal amount 

as of december 31 2018  we had 16 billion  of debt outstanding under our debt facilities which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 8 million  this amount includes the impact of an associated forward interest rate swap outstanding as of december 31 2018 which was entered into to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest payments on our debt facilities refer to note 10  derivative instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk

we believe that our intellectual property will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage for future technologies we also believe that we are not dependent upon any single patent or select group of patents our success depends more upon our extensive knowhow deep understanding of enduser processes and workflows innovative culture technical leadership and marketing and sales abilities although we do not rely only on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position we will enforce our intellectual property rights when and where appropriate 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  the company employed approximately 7000  persons some portions of our business primarily in europe and china are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from those in the united states in europe for example it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation benefits restructurings and layoffs we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 

regulatory matters 

wireless regulatory matters 

our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters 

the use of wireless voice data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world in the us the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” regulate spectrum use by nonfederal entities and federal entities respectively similarly countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies these include voice and data infrastructure mobile radios and portable or handheld devices consequently our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from timetotime by the fcc ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and consequently the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed 

other regulatory matters 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites certain products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products during 2017  compliance with us federal state and local and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

risk factors 

tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects these risks are not the only risks we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

we have organized the risk factors into two sections 1 risks related to our business and 2 risks related to our indebtedness 

risks related to our business 

the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from suppliers located outside the us shipments to nonus customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales we also expect to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 



 the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change  to be successful we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

the company’s industry is characterized by 

  

 future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment we could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

the company participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements  we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions to remain competitive we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide 

  

 we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in mobile computing products data capture products printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace 

the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business  we have grown rapidly over the last several years through the acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to us 

  

 inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price  our ability to expand revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results  we may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 

  

 infringement by the company or our suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly  third parties may claim that we or our suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a thirdparty’s patent or other intellectual property right we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish our objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result our products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation and our competitive position may be materially damaged  our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages we use copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information which we regard as trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and incurring substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of the company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use third party andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products such parties ceasing continued development of the operating system or restricting our access to such operating system could adversely impact our business and financial results  we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating system and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices as a result our financial results could be negatively impacted because a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage us 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations  like many companies we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we periodically perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection implement and manage disaster recovery testing and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption “phishing” and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

a cybersecurity incident including deliberate attacks and unintentional events may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at the company if our core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems andor data 

our products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages to date we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company  as part of our operations the company collects uses stores and transfers personal data of third parties and employees in and across jurisdictions the governing bodies in such jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use transfer storage and disclosure of personal data obtained from third parties and employees for example general data protection regulation effective may 2018 these laws may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the collection use storage transfer and disclosure of our third party and employee personal data compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in claims against the company or significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  we may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seek to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of the company’s installed product base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed product base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results 

defects or errors in the company’s software products could harm our reputation result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market such products  our software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner it is possible that errors defects or bugs will be found in our existing or future software products and related services with the possible results of delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel  the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect the company’s stock price operations and profitability  the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets since then a number of significant acts of terrorism have occurred and war continues in the middle east all of which may contribute to instability in financial markets additional acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect our facilities and operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

the impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies in the united states and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance the us government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances which include encouraging increased production in the united states these proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some us trade agreements the company imports a significant percentage of our products into the united states and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company’s financial performance if such customs duties are implemented it also may cause the us’ trading partners to take actions with respect to us imports or us investment activities in their respective countries any potential changes in trade policies in the united states and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect the company’s financial performance given the level of uncertainty over which provisions will be enacted the company cannot predict with certainty the impact of the proposals 

the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  on december 22 2017 us president donald trump signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the tcja among other things includes changes to us federal corporate income tax rate imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest allows for the accelerated expensing of capital expenditures and puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system we continue to analyze the impact the tcja may have on the company’s business notwithstanding the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate the overall impact of the tcja is uncertain and the company’s business and financial condition could be adversely affected we describe the estimated impact of the tcja on our business where appropriate throughout this form 10k and specifically in note 12 income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves  we are subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates  forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination disposition or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions many countries are adopting revisions to their respective tax laws based on the ongoing reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd”g20 base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project which if enacted could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the us our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases an economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan  and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations  natural disasters may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

zebra could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union zebra maintains its european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the uk and has significant operations and sales throughout europe although the uk has formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw such notice only triggered a twoyear period ending in march 2019 to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal which period could be followed by a transition period because the terms of the uk’s withdrawal are uncertain we are unable at this time to determine the impact on zebra’s operations and business in the uk and europe since the uk’s referendum in june 2016 to withdraw from the eu markets have been more volatile including fluctuations in the british pound that could adversely impact zebra’s operating costs in the uk such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact zebra’s sales in the uk and throughout europe a significant portion of our business involves cross border transactions throughout the region the future trade relationship between the uk and the eu could adversely impact zebra’s operations in the region by increasing costs on or importation requirements on shipments between our distribution center in the netherlands and customers in the uk or between our facility in the uk and customers in the eu 

we are exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business we enter into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers this exposes us to risks including among others i technological risks especially when the contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cyber security risk especially in managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of front loaded capital expenditures in longterm managed services contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we enter into fixedprice contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs  if our initial cost estimates are incorrect we can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor  we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and as we expand our global solutions and services business our use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software we may have disputes with our subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or our subcontractors and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by our subcontractor we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from our subcontractor our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

over the last several years we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners when we outsource certain business operations we are not able to directly control these activities our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases their actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations like import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business  it is our policy to require suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against us that could impact the saleability of the company’s products and expose us to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of our products  in addition to our own sales force we offer our products through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers these thirdparties may also market other products that compete with our products failure of one or more of our dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote our products could affect our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations as the company refines our channel program some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers may exit the program due to modifications to the program structure thereby reducing our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for thirdparty dealers distributors or retailers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products from other thirdparties or from us directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain of our products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers we may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shutdown may adversely affect our business results because we rely on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products we may incur increased business continuity risks  we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products if these thirdparty manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers going forward 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers we source some of our components from sole source suppliers any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations  our ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate 

delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from our suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters or financial issues we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us impacting our cash flow 

in addition our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  from time to time we are a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 

it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk  we have many types of insurance coverage and are also selfinsured for some risks and obligations while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain such as professional liability insurance which is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers as we grow our global solutions and services business we are being asked to obtain higher amounts of professional liability insurance which could result in higher costs to do business natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims professional liability and public liability are potential selfinsured events that could negatively impact our financial results in addition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim 

we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws  our operations and the products we manufacture andor sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws and regulations compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities restrict what products and services we can offer and generally impact our financial performance some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use disposal remediation emission and discharge of and exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance 

laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories recycling of both electronic products and packaging reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products standardization of connectors and power supplies the transportation of lithiumion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety radio interference radio frequency radiation exposure medical related functionality and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment these laws and changes to these laws could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products solutions and services and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include 

these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate that it will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products increasing energy efficiency and providing additional accessibility 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to report on our assessment as to the effectiveness of these controls any negative reports concerning our internal controls 

could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure appropriate implementation and maintenance of adequate internal controls over the financial reporting processes and reporting in the future we may incur significant additional costs in order to ensure we adequately remediate any weaknesses identified in our internal control environment which in turn would reduce our earnings implementing any remedial measures may be complicated by the limited timeframe in which to implement such measures and the possibility that implementation of such measures may require a substantial amount of work and time by our personnel 

any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements failure to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities in addition failure to comply with our reporting obligations with the sec may cause an event of default to occur under the debt agreements or similar instruments governing any debt we or our subsidiaries incur in the future 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories customer rebates and other customer consideration tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements for example implementing future accounting guidance related to revenue accounting for leases and other areas could require us to make significant changes to our accounting systems impact to existing credit agreements and could result in adverse changes to our financial statements 

risks related to our indebtedness 

in connection with the acquisition we incurred substantial debt obligations  our total outstanding debt for borrowed money was approximately 325 billion on october 27 2014 at december 31 2017  the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was 22 billion  gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs in addition subject to restrictions in agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness we may incur additional indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  

 we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 

despite our indebtedness we may need to incur substantially more indebtedness and take other actions that could further exacerbate the risk associated with our existing indebtedness  at december 31 2017  the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was 22 billion  gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs in addition to our current financing activities we may need to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future resulting in higher leverage subject to the limits contained in our debt agreements we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes to the extent we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness will be exacerbated 

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our quarterly operating results  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles the fair values of the swap contracts which will either be amounts receivable from or payable to counterparties are reflected as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we record our fair value change in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of “other net” if not hedged the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase we would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swap contracts introduce complexity to our operating results 

restrictive covenants in the debt agreements may limit our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies the debt agreements contain and instruments governing any future indebtedness may contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest we expect these covenants will limit our ability to 

 additionally the debt instruments entered into to fund a portion of the acquisition requires us to maintain in certain circumstances compliance with a consolidated total secured net leverage ratio our ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio the restrictions could adversely affect our ability to 

  

 a breach of any of the covenants contained in the debt agreements including an inability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants that is not remedied within the applicable cure period if any would result in an event of default under the debt agreements if when required we are unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness or amend the covenants contained in the debt agreements or if a default otherwise occurs that is not cured or waived the lenders or holders of our debt could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or institute foreclosure proceedings against those assets that secure the borrowings should the outstanding obligations be accelerated and become due and payable because of any failure to comply with the applicable covenants in the future we would be required to search for alternative measures to finance current and ongoing obligations of our business there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms if at all any of these scenarios could adversely impact our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

a significant amount of cash will be required to service our indebtedness  our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs general corporate expenditures and planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate a significant amount of cash this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive business legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we may not be able to affect 

any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness

acquisition and integration 

in october 2014 the company acquired the enterprise business “enterprise” from motorola solutions inc “msi” the “acquisition” and began integration activities focused on creating “one zebra” our integration priorities centered on maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing cost synergies operating efficiencies and integration of functional organizations and processes another key focus of the integration was to exit msiprovided transition service agreements “tsas” related primarily to it systems and support services these tsas were an interim measure to continue the operations of the enterprise business without disruption while integration activities were completed the company substantially completed its integration activities including the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system and has exited the last tsas with msi 

restructuring programs 

in the first quarter 2017 the company’s executive leadership approved an initiative to continue the company’s efforts to increase operational efficiency the “productivity plan” the company expects the productivity plan to build upon the exit and restructuring initiatives specific to the acquisition of the enterprise business “enterprise” from motorola solutions inc in october 2014 the “acquisition plan” actions under the productivity plan include organizational design changes process improvements and automation implementation of actions identified through the productivity plan is expected to be substantially complete by december 2018 exit and restructuring costs are not included in the operating results of our segments as they are not deemed to impact the specific segment measures as reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and 

therefore are reported as a component of corporate eliminations see note 15 segment information and geographic data in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further information 

total exit and restructuring charges of 12 million  lifetodate and yeartodate specific to the productivity plan have been recorded through december 31 2017  and relate to severance and related benefits lease exit costs and other expenses total remaining charges associated with this plan are expected to be in the range of 8 million to 12 million  with activities expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2018

see note 5 costs associated with exit and restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further information 

impact of us tax reform 

the company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the tax cut and jobs act “tcja” or “the act” signed into law on december 22 2017 and has provisionally provided income tax expense of 72 million  including remeasurement of its net deferred tax assets at 21  of 35 million  and the onetime transition tax of 37 million  the onetime transition tax impact has been reduced by approximately 10 million  of income tax credit carryfowards resulting in an estimated cash tax liability of 26 million  of which 2 million  has been classified as a short term liability and 24 million  as a long term liability both to be remitted over the next eight years as follows in millions 



the company expects that the greatest factor impacting its future effective tax rate is the federal reduction in the tax rate from 35  to 21  primarily due to uncertainties in the interpretation of the onetime transition tax rules and the determination of cash or other specified assets the december 31 2017 effective tax rate could differ materially from the amount disclosed in the financial statements as permitted the company will update the estimates disclosed herein on a quarterly basis throughout 2018 see note 12  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further information 

the company has reviewed the impact of other provisions of the act which took effect on january 1 2018 and after based on current operations we estimate that the company will be subject to the global intangible lowtaxed income and the deduction for foreignderived intangible income provisions of the act we estimate that the new limitations which defer us interest deductions in excess of 30  of adjusted taxable income will not be applicable additionally the company will no longer be able to deduct compensation for its covered employees which exceeds the limitation under internal revenue code section 162m

3 amounts included in corporate eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments not reported in segments related to the acquisition 

2017  compared to 2016   

net sales increased by 148 million  or 41  compared with the prior year period the increase in net sales was due to higher hardware sales in north america emea and latin america offset by lower hardware sales in asiapacific the increase in hardware sales was largely attributable to increased sales of mobile computing data capture and barcode printing products partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the wireless lan business in october 2016 services sales were lower primarily due to the impact of the wireless lan divestiture consolidated organic net sales growth was 65  reflecting growth in all four geographic regions most notably in emea and north america and latin america 

gross margin as a percent of sales was 459  or flat compared to the prior year this reflects an increase in gross margin in the evm segment primarily due to changes in business mix and improved product costs offset by lower ait segment gross margin driven primarily by higher overhead and services costs and increased customer sales incentives 

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 were 14 billion  or 373  of net sales and 16 billion  or 437  of net sales respectively the reduction in operating expenses was primarily due to impairment charges related to the disposal of the company’s wireless lan business in the prior year period lower acquisition and integration costs and lower amortization of intangible assets during 2017 the company substantially completed its integration activities including the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning system associated with the acquisition the company also exited the transition services agreements with motorola solutions the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was due to certain assets reaching full amortization in 2017 exit and restructuring costs were also lower than the yearago period due to the prior year charges that included costs associated with the divestiture of the wireless lan business research and development costs were higher primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense associated with improved financial performance partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the wireless lan business general and administrative expenses were lower compared to the prior year period due primarily to reduced facility and it expenses professional fees and employee benefits costs as well as the impact of the divestiture of the wireless lan business being offset partially by increased incentive compensation expense associated with improved financial performance 

operating income increased  242 million  compared to the prior year the increase was due to the decline in operating expenses as well as the increase in sales and gross profit 

interest expense was 227 million  for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 193 million  in the prior year the increase over the prior year was driven by the payments for early debt extinguishment of 65 million  and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to the redemption of senior notes of 16 million  offset in part by the impact of early repayments of debt and lower interest rates 

other nonoperating expenses decreased 5 million  to 6 million  for the year ended december 31 2017 this decrease is driven by longterm investment impairments of 1 million  in the current year compared to 7 million  in the prior year 

the company recognized tax expense of   71 million   and   8 million   for the period ending december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the company’s effective tax rates were   807   and   62   as of december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively   the company’s effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate of 35  primarily due to deferred income taxed on the outbound transfer of us assets an increase in uncertain tax benefits increased valuation allowance for its foreign deferred tax assets foreign nondeductible expenses the onetime transition tax and remeasurement of its net us deferred tax assets under us tax reform these increases were partially offset by the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions recognition of deferred tax assets on intercompany asset transfers the generation of tax credits in the current year and deductions from vesting of equity compensation 

2016 compared to 2015 

net sales decreased by 76 million  or 21  compared with the prior year period the decline in net sales is due to lower hardware sales in north america emea and latin america including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes partially offset by higher hardware sales in asiapacific the decline in hardware sales is largely attributable to lower sales of barcode printer data capture wireless lan products and location solutions organic net sales increased 04  compared to the prior year period reflecting growth in asiapacific and north america offset by declines in emea and latin america 

gross margin as a percent of sales was 459  compared to the prior year period of 450  this improvement in gross margin reflects an increase in the evm segment gross margin primarily due to lower services and hardware product costs ait segment gross margin decreased primarily due to lower sales demand and the impact of incentive programs including the concessions to distributors of printer products imported into china partially offset by product cost improvements 

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 were 16 billion  or 437  and 440  of net sales respectively the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects the company’s continued focus on improving operating efficiency and controlling expenses selling and marketing expenses were lower compared to the prior year due to the fullyear impact of staff reductions implemented in 2015 and lower discretionary expenses and promotional spending the decrease in research and development costs was primarily due to a reduction in headcount and other thirdparty resources the impact from the divestiture of the wireless lan business and shifting of headcount to lower cost engineering locations the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher it related expenses including increased support and maintenance costs for it infrastructure and business systems as we exit transition services agreements with motorola solutions and increased legal fees and litigation related expenses the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due to impairment charges taken in the current year along with other intangible assets becoming fully amortized impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of 62 million  was recorded during the third quarter related to the wireless lan business divestiture the company has made significant progress on its integration activities associated with the acquisition including exiting many transition services agreements with motorola solutions this has resulted in a decline in acquisition and integration costs compared to the prior year period exit and restructuring costs were lower due to a reduced level of restructuring activity as the company progresses with its restructuring plan related to the acquisition partially offset by expenses associated with the company’s divestiture of its wireless lan business 

operating income increased 43 million  or 1162  compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to the decline in operating expenses 

the company conducts business in multiple currencies throughout the world thus has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates with regard to nonfunctional denominated revenue cash assets and cash liabilities as a result of these exposures the company recognized a foreign exchange loss of 5 million  for 2016 

interest expense was  193 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 flat compared to the prior year early repayments of debt resulted in accelerated amortization costs while debt refinancing savings were offset by closing costs of the refinancing 

other nonoperating expenses increased 10 million  to 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 this increase is driven by longterm investment impairments of 7 million  and an increase in accelerated loan discount amortization of 3 million  due to the debt refinancing see note 8  longterm debt for further information on the debt refinancing amendments 

in the period ending december 31 2016 the company recognized tax expense of   8 million   compared to a tax benefit of  22 million   for 2015 the company’s effective tax rates were   62   and   122   as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively   the company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35  primarily due to deferred income taxed on the outbound transfer of us assets pretax losses in the united states and the rate differential between us and foreign jurisdictions

2017  compared to 2016   

ait net sales for the period ending december 31 2017  increased  64 million  or 51  compared to prior year period the increase in net sales was largely driven by higher sales of barcode and card printers primarily in the emea and asiapacific regions sales of supplies and services were also higher than the prior year the yearonyear growth also reflects a price concession to distributors of barcode printer products imported into china in the third quarter of 2016 during 2017 no additional price concession provisions were required and a reduction of the 2016 provision was recorded due to a change in import classification for barcode printers ait organic net sales growth for the yearended december 31 2017 was 46  

gross margin as a percentage of sales was 488  compared to 497  for comparable prior year period the decrease in gross margin reflects higher overhead costs including freight and costs associated with our regional distribution center transitions higher services costs and increased customer sales incentives offset partially by lower provisions for price concessions to distributors of barcode printer products imported into china 

operating income increased 83  as a result of increased net sales and gross profit operating expenses were comparable to the prior year period 

2016  compared to 2015   

ait net sales for the period ending december 31 2016  decreased 39 million  or 30  compared to prior year period the decline in net sales was primarily due to lower net sales of barcode printers and location solutions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes most notably in emea which was partially offset by an increase in sales of supplies the barcode printer sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in north america and emea ait organic net sales declined compared to the prior year period by 12  

gross margin as a percentage of sales was 497  compared to 509  for comparable prior year period the decrease in gross margin included impacts from lower sales of barcode printers the impact of incentive programs including the concession to distributors of printer products imported into china costs associated with the relocation of north american distribution operations and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes these factors were partially offset by manufacturing cost improvements in supplies and lower hardware product costs

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the company under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available at that time 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements see note 2  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary factors that influence our liquidity include but are not limited to the amount and timing of our revenues cash collections from our customers capital expenditures repatriation of foreign cash and investments and acquisitions of thirdparties management believes that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated in millions 



the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance is reflective of the following 

2017  vs 2016   

cash flows from operations increased 98 million  during 2017  to 478 million  this improvement was driven by an increase in net earnings of 154 million  partially offset by a decline in working capital primarily related to higher inventory levels and lower accounts payable net inventory increased primarily as a result of growth in the business and changes in product mix an increased backlog level compared to the prior year and our recent transition to a new distribution model for our european operations in addition the prior year working capital benefited from the successful renegotiation of longer payment terms with vendors 

net cash used in the purchase of property plant and equipment declined 27 million  as compared to the prior year as capital expenditures related to the acquisition integration were substantially completed in 2016 the prior year investing activities also included net cash proceeds of 39 million  related to the sale of the wireless lan business 

net cash used in financing activities during 2017  consisted of proceeds related to the ar credit agreement for term loan a of 688 million  a draw on the revolving credit facility of 275 million  and proceeds related to the receivables financing facility of 145 million  these proceeds were primarily used to redeem 11 billion  in principal of the 725  senior notes maturing october 2022 the company also had debt principal prepayments on term loan a and term loan b of 502 million  and on the receivables financing facility of 10 million  as part of the repricing of term loan b a portion of the debt was deemed to be modified and therefore the company included 263 million  in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt offset by 263 million  in payments of longterm debt within the consolidated statements of cash flows 

2016 vs 2015 

cash flows from operations increased 258 million during 2016 to 380 million this improvement was driven by lower net losses of 21 million which included significant noncash drivers of a lower deferred income tax benefit of 98 million and asset impairment for goodwill intangibles and other assets of 69 million primarily related to the wireless lan business divestiture additionally the company had improved working capital related items of 90 million during 2016 working capital 

related improvements consisted primarily of accounts payable increases due to the company successfully renegotiating longer payment terms with vendors being partially offset by an increase in income tax cash outflows 

net cash used in investing activities during 2016 included capital expenditures of 77 million compared to 122 million in 2015 the decrease consisted primarily of a reduction in integration and real estate related capital expenditures this was offset somewhat by the sale of the wireless lan business resulting in net cash received of 39 million 

net cash used in financing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of early debt principal repayments of 382 million under the term loan compared to early debt principal repayments of 165 million in the comparable prior year period resulting from the debt refinancing amendments entered into during fiscal 2016 the company recognized 102 million of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt offset by 102 million in payments of longterm debt within the consolidated statements of cash flows additionally proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases “espp” were 11 million in 2016 compared to 17 million in 2015 reflecting decreased option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards were 8 million in 2016 compared to 13 million in 2015 reflecting decreased stock exercises 

see note 8 longterm debt  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

the following table shows the carrying value of the company’s debt in millions 

credit facilities 

on july 26 2017 the company entered into the ar credit agreement which amended modified and added provisions to the company’s previous credit agreement the ar credit agreement provides for a term loan a of 688 million  and increased the existing revolving credit facility from 250 million  to 500 million  the company incurred and capitalized debt issuance costs of 5 million  related to term loan a and the increased revolving credit facility under the ar credit agreement

receivables financing facility 

on december 1 2017 a whollyowned bankruptcyremote specialpurpose entity “spe” of the company entered into the receivables purchase agreement which provides for a receivables financing facility of up to 180 million  the spe utilizes the receivables financing facility in the normal course of business as part of its management of cash flows under its committed receivables financing facility a subsidiary of the company sells its domestically originated accounts receivables at fair value on a revolving basis to the spe which was formed for the sole purpose of buying the receivables the spe in turn pledges a valid and perfected firstpriority security interest in the pool of purchased receivables to a financial institution for borrowing purposes the subsidiary retains an ownership interest in the pool of receivables that are sold to the spe and services those receivables accordingly the company has determined that these transactions do not qualify for sale accounting under asc 860 transfers and servicing of financial assets  and has therefore accounted for the transactions as secured borrowings 

at december 31 2017  the company’s consolidated balance sheets included 421 million  of receivables that were pledged and 135 million  of associated liabilities the spe borrowed 145 million  on the receivables financing facility and repaid 10 million  in 2017 in 2017 the company recorded expenses related to its receivables financing facility of 1 million  as interest expense net on the company’s consolidated statements of operations the receivables financing facility will mature on november 29 2019

from january 1 2018 through february 22 2018 the company made principal debt repayments of 63 million  

the company was in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2017 and is currently not aware of any events that would cause noncompliance with any covenants in the future 

summary of fiscal 2017 actions 

the actions taken during fiscal 2017 resulted in net repayments of 454 million  and included the following 

 

historically significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2018  we believe that our existing cash and investments borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and receivables financing facility together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating capital expenditure and debt obligation requirements for the next 12 months 

certain domestic subsidiaries of the company the “guarantor subsidiaries” guarantee the term loans and the revolving credit facility on a senior basis for the period ended december 31 2017  the nonguarantor subsidiaries would have a accounted for 573  of our total revenue and b held 869  or 43 billion  of our total assets and approximately 876  or 30 billion  of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities 

as of december 31 2017  the company’s cash position of 62 million  included foreign cash and investments of 54 million  

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  were in millions 



purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials and finished goods 

uncertain tax benefits of 51 million  have been excluded from the above table 20 million  is a current liability as of december 31 2017 the remainder is classified as longterm in nature as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority see note 12 income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further information

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency changes zebra is exposed to the following types of market risk interest rates and foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances primary exposures include libor rates from time to time we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and based on current and projected market conditions achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floatingrate debt generally under these swaps we agree with a counterparty to exchange floatingrate for fixedrate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional principal amount 

as of december 31 2017  we had 22 billion  of debt outstanding under our debt facilities which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the various debt instruments we hold would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately 22 million  this amount excludes the impact of any associated derivative contracts to mitigate this risk we entered into forward interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest payments on our debt facilities refer to note 7 derivative instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussion of hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk 

we provide products and services in over 180  countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 7 derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k  for further discussions of hedging activities 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily with respect to the euro british pound sterling czech koruna brazilian real canadian dollar australian dollar singapore dollar japanese yen and swedish krona in general we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar a 1 increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the us dollar would increase or decrease our pretax income by approximately 2 million  this amount excludes the impact of any associated derivative contracts which would largely offset this foreign exchange exposure we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the consolidated balance sheets of certain entities with exposures denominated in foreign currencies these transactions are typically three months in maturity and are not designated as hedges

intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trade secrets patents trademarks copyrights and contractual rights to establish and protect our innovations and holds a large portfolio of intellectual property rights in the united states and other countries as of december 31 2016 the company owned approximately 1600 trademark registrations and trademark applications and approximately 4200 patents and patent applications worldwide we continue to actively seek to obtain patents and trademarks whenever possible and practical to secure intellectual property rights in our innovations 

we believe that our intellectual property will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage for future technologies we also believe that we are not dependent upon any single patent or select group of patents our success depends more upon our extensive knowhow deep understanding of enduser processes and workflows innovative culture technical leadership and marketing and sales abilities although we do not rely only on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position we will enforce our intellectual property rights when and where appropriate 

employees 

as of december 31 2016 the company employed approximately 6500  persons some portions of our business primarily in europe and china are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from those in the united states in europe for example it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation benefits restructurings and layoffs we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 

regulatory matters 

wireless regulatory matters 

our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters 

the use of wireless voice data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world in the us the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” regulate spectrum use by nonfederal entities and federal entities respectively similarly countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies these include voice and data infrastructure mobile radios and portable or hand held devices consequently our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from timetotime by the fcc ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and consequently the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed 

other regulatory matters 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites certain products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products during 2016 compliance with us federal state and local and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

risk factors 

tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects these risks are not the only risks we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

we have organized the risk factors into three sections 1 risks related to our business 2 risks related to the acquisition and integration of enterprise and 3 risks related to our indebtedness 

risks related to our business 

the company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from suppliers located outside the us shipments to nonus customers are 

expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales we also expect to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 the company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change  to be successful we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

the company’s industry is characterized by 

  

 future success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment we could incur substantial costs if we have to modify our business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

the company participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements  we face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions to remain competitive we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide 

  

 we cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in mobile computing products data capture products printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace 

the company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business  we have grown rapidly over the last several years through the acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to us 

  

 inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price  our ability to expand revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results  we may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to us the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 

  

 infringement by the company or our suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly  third parties may claim that we or our suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a thirdparty’s patent or other intellectual property right we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish our objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result our products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation and our competitive position may be materially damaged  our intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages we use copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information which we regard as trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any 

infringement litigation that the company may undertake to protect our intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and incurring substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of the company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use third party andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products such parties ceasing continued development of the operating system or restricting our access to such operating system could adversely impact our business and financial results  we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating system and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices as a result our financial results could be negatively impacted because a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage us 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations  like many companies we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we periodically perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection and implement and manage disaster recovery testing a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption “phishing” and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

a cybersecurity incident including deliberate attacks and unintentional events may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at the company if our core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems andor data 

our products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages to date we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs legal claims or fines against the company  as part of our operations the company collects uses stores and transfers personal data of third parties and employees in and across jurisdictions the governing bodies in such jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection use transfer storage and disclosure of personal data obtained from third parties and employees for example general data protection regulation effective may 2018 these laws may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the collection use storage transfer and disclosure of our third party and employee personal data compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in claims against the company or significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  we may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers we generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seek to limit such risk through product design 

manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of the company’s installed product base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed product base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results 

defects or errors in the company’s software products could harm our reputation result in significant cost to us and impair our ability to market such products  our software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner it is possible that errors defects or bugs will be found in our existing or future software products and related services with the possible results of delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

we depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel  the future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect the company’s stock price operations and profitability  the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets since then a number of significant acts of terrorism have occurred and war continues in the middle east all of which may contribute to instability in financial markets additional acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect our facilities and operations or those of our customers or suppliers 

the impact of potential changes in tax and trade policies in the united states and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect our financial performance the us government has recently proposed comprehensive tax and trade reform these proposals are designed to encourage increased production in the united states and include a border tax on imports an increase in customs duties and the renegotiation of us trade agreements the company imports a significant percentage of our products into the united states and the imposition of a border tax or an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the company’s financial performance if such taxes or customs duties are implemented it also may cause the us’ trading partners to take actions with respect to us imports or us investment activities in their respective countries any potential changes in tax and trade policies in the united states and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which the company does business could adversely affect the company’s financial performance given the level of uncertainty over which provisions will be enacted the company cannot predict with certainty the impact of the proposals 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves  we are subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the company’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates  forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination disposition or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions t he european union and countries within the european union are contemplating changes to their respective tax laws based on the recent reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development 

“oecd”g20 base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project which if enacted could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations within europe our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business general disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan  and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations  natural disasters may occur in the future and the company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we could be adversely impacted by the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union we maintain our european regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the uk and have significant operations and sales throughout europe because the terms of the uk’s withdrawal are uncertain we are unable at this time to determine the impact on our operations and business in the uk and europe the uk’s referendum has resulted and is expected to continue to result in market volatility including fluctuations in the british pound that could adversely impact our operating costs in the uk such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact our sales in the uk and throughout europe a significant portion of our business involves cross border transactions throughout the region future trade agreements between the uk and the european union could adversely impact our operations in the region by increasing costs on or importation requirements on shipments between our distribution center in the netherlands and customers in the uk or between our facility in the uk and customers in the european union 

we are exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business we enter into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers this exposes us to risks including among others i technological risks especially when the contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cyber security risk especially in managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of front loaded capital expenditures in longterm managed services contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

we enter into fixedprice contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs  if our initial cost estimates are incorrect we can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor  we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and as we expand our global solutions and services business our use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software we may have disputes with our subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and 

timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or our subcontractors and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by our subcontractor we are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from our subcontractor our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

over the last several years we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution engineering services and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners as we outsource more of our business operations we are not able to directly control these activities our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases their actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations like import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business  it is our policy to require suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however we do not control their labor and other business practices if one of our suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged if one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against us that could impact the saleability of the company’s products and expose us to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of our products  in addition to our own sales force we offer our products through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers these thirdparties may also market other products that compete with our products failure of one or more of our dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote our products could affect our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations as the company refines our recently implemented channel program some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers may exit the program due to modifications to the program structure thereby reducing our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for thirdparty dealers distributors or retailers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products from other thirdparties or from us directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain of our products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers we may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shutdown may adversely affect our business results because we rely on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products we may incur increased business continuity risks  we are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products if these third party manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance 

would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers going forward 

our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers we source some of our components from sole source suppliers any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations  our ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from our suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters or financial issues we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us impacting our cash flow 

in addition our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  from time to time we are made a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 

it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhausts our coverage we may be forced to retain the risk  we have many types of insurance coverage and is also selfinsured for some risks and obligations while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain such as professional liability insurance which is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers as we grow our global solutions and services business we are being asked to obtain higher amounts of professional liability insurance which could result in higher costs to do business natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims professional liability and public liability are potential selfinsured events that could negatively impact our financial results in addition while we maintain insurance for certain risks the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim 

we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws  our operations and the products we manufacture andor sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws and regulations compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities impact our production capabilities constrict our ability to sell expand or acquire facilities restrict what products and services we can offer and generally impact our financial performance some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use disposal remediation emission and discharge of and exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault we continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance 

laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories recycling of both electronic products and packaging reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products standardization of connectors and power supplies the transportation of lithiumion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety radio interference radio frequency radiation exposure medical related functionality and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment these laws and changes to these laws could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products solutions and services and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include 

these laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively we expect these trends to continue in addition we anticipate that it will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products increasing energy efficiency and providing additional accessibility 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to report on our assessment as to the effectiveness of these controls any negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement particularly with respect to areas of our business impacted by the integration of our business processes systems and facilities we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure appropriate implementation and maintenance of adequate internal controls over the financial reporting processes and reporting in the future we may incur significant additional costs in order to ensure we adequately remediate any weaknesses identified in our internal control environment which in turn would reduce our earnings implementing any remedial measures may be complicated by the limited timeframe in which to implement such measures the possibility that implementation of such measures may require a substantial amount of work and time by our personnel and the challenge of migrating to a new erp while implementing such remedial measures in addition development of an integrated financial reporting system with the accompanying system of internal controls to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 may increase the time and costs necessary to complete the integration of enterprise or cause us to miss our reporting obligations 

any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements failure to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities in addition failure to comply with our reporting obligations with the sec may cause an event of default to occur under the debt agreements or similar instruments governing any debt we or our subsidiaries incur in the future 

we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories customer rebates and other customer consideration tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements for example implementing future accounting guidance related to revenue accounting for leases and other areas could require us to make significant changes to our accounting systems impact to existing credit agreements and could result in adverse changes to our financial statements 

risks related to the acquisition and integration of enterprise 

we may be unable to effectively integrate enterprise into our existing business  the integration of enterprise into our operations is a significant undertaking and requires significant attention from our management the acquisition with an approximate enterprise value of 345 billion is significantly larger than prior acquisitions we have completed and significantly increased the size of our operations increased our number of employees and operating facilities and expanded our geographic scope there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate enterprise or if such integration is successfully accomplished that such integration will not be costlier than currently contemplated there can also be no assurance that we can successfully manage the combined business due to our greatly increased size and scope if we cannot successfully integrate and manage enterprise within a reasonable time following the acquisition we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits of the acquisition which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

we may be unable to realize the expected growth opportunities and cost savings from the acquisition  in connection with the integration of enterprise into our existing operating structure we seek to realize growth opportunities along with cost savings the anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement integration measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters our ability to achieve the planned cost synergies relies upon a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control for example we may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs in a timely fashion or at all our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements from the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

we continue to rely on msi to perform certain critical transition services and there can be no assurance that those services will be performed timely and effectively or that we can replace those services prior to the expiration of the transition services agreement or successfully develop our own operations going forward  under the terms of the transition services agreement that we entered into with msi in connection with the acquisition msi provided and continues to provide us with services critical for the operation and continuity of our operation of enterprise we have transitioned some of these critical functions and are in the process of transitioning other critical functions which primarily include information technology systems until we transition all such functions we will continue to rely on msi for those services there can be no assurances that these remaining services will be performed timely and effectively or that we will be able to successfully or timely transition remaining functions and assume responsibility over them significant disruption in these transition services or unanticipated costs related to these services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additionally if we are unable to transition such remaining services to ourselves in a timely fashion or without disruption to our operations we could experience an adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows and results of operations 

as part of the integration we are moving enterprise off of our legacy erp systems and implementing an erp system under a single instance with our legacy business the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and results of operations  we are currently replacing our multiple legacy business systems including moving enterprise off of our legacy systems that are being operated under a transition services agreement with msi with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for us the integrated system will streamline a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters we moved our operations in asia pacific to the combined erp in may 2016 and expect to move our operations in north america latin america and emea to the combined erp before the end of fiscal year 2017 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that often continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are needed for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of our consolidated operations our financial position and cash flows which could impact our ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 after the company transitions enterprise off of our legacy erp system data contained on that legacy erp system may be difficult and costly to access 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations as of december 31 2016  we had 29 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets a significant increase since prior to the acquisition of enterprise at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by us gaap we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of 62 million was recorded during the third quarter related to the wireless lan business divestiture 

risks related to our indebtedness 

in connection with the acquisition we incurred substantial debt obligations  our total outstanding debt for borrowed money was approximately 325 billion on october 27 2014 at december 31 2016 the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was  27 billion  gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs in addition subject to restrictions in agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness we may incur additional indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  



 we expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors additionally we have not previously undertaken substantial amounts of indebtedness historically we operated our business without incurring significant indebtedness for borrowed money and has limited experience operating our business subject to the constraints imposed by debt agreements 

despite our indebtedness we may need to incur substantially more indebtedness and take other actions that could further exacerbate the risk associated with our existing indebtedness  at december 31 2016  the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was  27 billion  in addition to the financing activities we may need to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future resulting in higher leverage subject to the limits contained in our debt agreements we may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes to the extent we incur additional indebtedness the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness will be exacerbated 

our use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our quarterly operating results  we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles the fair values of the swap contracts which will either be amounts receivable from or payable to counterparties are reflected as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we record our fair value change in our consolidated statements of earnings as a component of “other net” if not hedged the associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase we would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swap contracts introduce complexity to our operating results 

restrictive covenants in the debt agreements may limit our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies the debt agreements contain and instruments governing any future indebtedness may contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on our ability to take actions that we believe may be in our interest we expect these covenants will limit our ability to 

 additionally the term loan entered into to fund a portion of the acquisition requires us to maintain in certain circumstances compliance with a consolidated total secured net leverage ratio our ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio the restrictions could adversely affect our ability to 

  



a breach of any of the covenants contained in the debt agreements including an inability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants that is not remedied within the applicable cure period if any would result in an event of default under the debt agreements if when required we are unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness or amend the covenants contained in the debt agreements or if a default otherwise occurs that is not cured or waived the lenders or holders of our debt securities could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or institute foreclosure proceedings against those assets that secure the borrowings should the outstanding obligations be accelerated and become due and payable because of any failure to comply with the applicable covenants in the future we would be required to search for alternative measures to finance current and ongoing obligations of our business there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms if at all any of these scenarios could adversely impact our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

a significant amount of cash will be required to service our indebtedness  our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs general corporate expenditures and planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate a significant amount of cash this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive business legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition we may not be able to effect any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness

net sales to customers by geographic region were as follows in millions except percentages 



operating expenses are summarized below in millions except percentages 



the company’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following tables in millions except percentages 

1 the businesses included in our enterprise segment were acquired as part of the acquisition the consolidated results for the year ended december 31 2014 include only two months november and december 2014 of the enterprise segment the increase in net sales gross profit operating expenses and operating income for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily related to the acquisition 

2016 compared to 2015 

net sales decreased by 76 million  or 21  compared with the prior year period the decline in net sales is due to lower hardware sales in north america emea and latin america including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes partially offset by higher hardware sales in asiapacific the decline in hardware sales is largely attributable to lower sales of barcode printer data capture wireless lan products and location solutions on a constant currency basis and excluding purchase accounting adjustments overall net sales declined approximately 1 compared to the prior year period reflecting growth of approximately 4 in asiapacific offset by declines of approximately 2 1 and 3 in north america emea and latin america respectively 

gross margin as a percent of sales was 459  compared to the prior year period of 450  this improvement in gross margin reflects an increase in the enterprise segment gross margin primarily due to lower services and hardware product costs legacy zebra segment gross margin decreased primarily due to lower sales demand and the impact of incentive programs including the concessions to distributors of printer products imported into china partially offset by product cost improvements 

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 were  16 billion  or 437  and 440  of net sales respectively the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects the company’s continued focus on improving operating efficiency and controlling expenses selling and marketing expenses were lower compared to the prior year due to the fullyear impact of staff reductions implemented in 2015 and lower discretionary expenses and promotional spending the decrease in research and development costs was primarily due to a reduction in headcount and other thirdparty resources the impact from the divestiture of the wireless lan business and shifting of headcount to lower cost engineering locations the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher it related expenses including increased support and maintenance costs for it infrastructure and business systems as we exit transition services agreements with motorola solutions and increased legal fees and litigation related expenses the decrease in amortization of intangibles was due to impairment charges taken in the current year along with other intangible assets becoming fully amortized impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of 62 million was recorded during the third quarter related to the wireless lan business divestiture the company has made significant progress on its integration activities associated with the acquisition including exiting many transition services agreements with motorola solutions this has resulted in a decline in acquisition and integration costs compared to the prior year period exit and restructuring costs were lower due to a reduced level of restructuring activity as the company progresses with its restructuring plan related to the acquisition partially offset by expenses associated with the company’s divestiture of its wireless lan business 

operating income increased  43 million  or 1162  compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to the decline in operating expenses 

the company conducts business in multiple currencies throughout the world thus has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates with regard to nonfunctional denominated revenue cash assets and cash liabilities as a result of these exposures the company recognized a foreign exchange loss of 5 million  for 2016 

interest expense was  193 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 flat compared to the prior year early repayments of debt resulted in accelerated amortization costs while debt refinancing savings were offset by closing costs of the refinancing 

other nonoperating expenses increased 10 million  to 11 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 this increase is driven by longterm investment impairments of 7 million and an increase in accelerated loan discount amortization of 3 million due to the debt refinancing see note 9 longterm debt for further information on the debt refinancing amendments 

in the period ending december 31 2016 the company recognized tax expense of  8 million   compared to a tax benefit of  22 million   for 2015 the company’s effective tax rates were   62   and   122   as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively   the company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to deferred income taxed on the outbound transfer of us assets pretax losses in the united states and the rate differential between us and foreign jurisdictions 

2015 compared to 2014 

net sales growth of 1183 for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year was primarily as a result of the acquisition of the enterprise business and higher north america sales offset partially by 149 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects net of hedges the enterprise business contributed 1888 million or 954 of the increase in total net sales increased gross profit by 808 million or 934 and increased recurring operating expenses by 830 million or 959 and nonrecurring operating expenses by 42 million or 813 included within the total recurring operating expenses was an increase of 197 million of amortization expense as a result of intangibles acquired within nonrecurring operating expenses were increases of 18 million of integration and acquisition costs as a result of it costs of transitioning and exiting the motorola platforms and 34 million of exit and restructuring costs as a result of integrating acquired facilities and related employees 

included in the total enterprise impacts of 2015 versus 2014 are the following purchase accounting adjustments a 10 million reduction in revenue related to the valuation of service contracts acquired a 25 million decrease to cost of sales related to a step up in value of inventory acquired and a 167 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses 

net sales excluding the impact of the acquisition of the enterprise business increased by 91 million or 77 in 2015 versus 2014 the unfavorable impact of foreign currency reduced sales by 70 million this increase is primarily due to sales growth in the north america and asiapacific regions specifically higher volumes of barcode printers and location solutions latin america sales were lower driven by a weak macroeconomic environment consolidated net sales excluding the effect of the enterprise business grew 125 on a constant currency basis 

gross margin as a percent of sales excluding the effect of the enterprise business was 509 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 500 in the comparable year ended december 31 2014 this increase in margins reflects the favorable impact of higher unit sales within the north america and asiapacific regions and lower product costs for both hardware and supplies offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency effects net of hedges 

operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 excluding the effect of the enterprise business were 415 million compared to 370 million in the prior year included in the increase were exit and restructuring costs within legacy zebra of 10 million related to organizational redesign as a percentage of sales operating expenses excluding the enterprise business were 323 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 310 for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to additional investments made to support business growth in the sales research and development and administrative functions and exit and restructuring costs 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2015 excluding the effect of the enterprise business increased 12 million or 52 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to higher sales and gross profit partially offset by higher operating expenses and the unfavorable foreign currency effects net of hedges 

the company recognized a foreign exchange loss of 23 million for 2015 as a result of changes in the value of nonus dollar assets and liabilities primarily related to the enterprise business that were not hedged during the period 

interest expense was 194 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 63 million for 2014 mainly reflecting the indebtedness incurred related to the acquisition of 32 billion borrowed in october of 2014 there was also 4 million of forward interest rate swap gains in 2015 included in interest expense compared to a 5 million loss in 2014 primarily due to the changes in market interest rates 

in 2015 the company recognized a tax benefit of 22 million compared to a tax benefit of 15 million for 2014 the company’s effective tax rates were 122 and 950 as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively the company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to pretax losses in the united states and corporate structure realignment initiatives in various nonus jurisdictions 

since the date of the acquisition as part of its corporate initiatives of integrating the enterprise business the company has been executing its integration plan for the enterprise business the “integration plan” the company anticipates completing the integration plan as soon as practicable and expects that the integration plan will allow the combined businesses to achieve further synergies and cost savings associated with the acquisition as part of the integration plan the company began realigning certain acquired assets of the enterprise business with and into the company’s corporate structure and business model

legacy zebra segment 

amounts in millions except percentages 

2016 compared to 2015 

net sales for the period ending december 31 2016 within legacy zebra decreased  39 million  or 30  compared to prior year period the decline in net sales was primarily due to lower net sales of barcode printers and location solutions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes most notably in emea which was partially offset by an increase in sales of supplies the barcode printer sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in north america and emea legacy zebra sales declined compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis by approximately 1 

gross margin as a percentage of sales was 497  compared to 509 for comparable prior year period the decrease in gross margin included impacts from lower sales of barcode printers the impact of incentive programs including the concession to distributors of printer products imported into china costs associated with the relocation of north american distribution operations and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes these factors were partially offset by manufacturing cost improvements in supplies and lower hardware product costs 

operating income declined 70  as a result of lower net sales and gross margin partially offset by lower operating expenses 

2015 compared to 2014 

net sales for 2015 increased 91 million or 77 compared to 2014 net sales growth compared to 2014 on a constant currency basis was 149 million or 125 this reflects higher net sales for the north america and asiapacific regions net sales in emea were essentially unchanged while latin america net sales were lower on a constant currency basis net sales in emea increased 14 compared to 2014 the increase in net sales for the north america region was primarily due to higher volume of sales related to barcode printers and location solutions the higher level of net sales for emea and asiapacific regions reflected increased volumes of barcode printers the decrease in net sales in the latin america region was primarily driven by a weak macroeconomic environment 

gross margin as a percentage of sales was 509 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 500 for 2014 this increase in margin reflects the favorable impact of higher unit sales and lower product costs for both hardware and supplies offset partially by unfavorable foreign currency effects net of hedges 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2015 increased 84 as a result of higher sales and gross profit partially offset by increases in operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency effects net of hedges operating expenses increased compared to the prior year primarily to support business growth 

enterprise segment amounts in millions except percentages 

2016 compared to 2015 

net sales for the period ending december 31 2016 within enterprise decreased  43 million  or 18  compared to prior year period the decline in net sales was primarily driven by lower sales of wireless lan and data capture products and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes in emea partially offset by higher sales of mobile computing products the sales decline compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis was approximately 1 

gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2016 was 442  compared to 424  in the prior year period the improvement in gross margin was due primarily to lower service and hardware product costs including lower excess and obsolescence expense the prior year costs also included higher product rebranding expenses this improvement was partially offset by product mix and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes 

operating income increased 212  primarily as a result of improvement in gross margin and lower operating expenses partially offset by lower sales 

2015 compared to 2014 

on october 27 2014 the company acquired enterprise an industry leader in mobile computing and data capture technologies and services therefore 2014 only includes results since the acquisition date and is not directly comparable to the full fiscal year 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2015 net sales for enterprise were 24 billion compared to 482 million in 2014 which includes net sales only for the period following the acquisition mobile computing data capture and repair services generated the majority of enterprise net sales for the year in 2015 and 2014 the regions which accounted for the majority of 2015 and 2014 enterprise net sales included north america and emea sales in the fourth quarter were 635 million up 48 compared to the third quarter due to higher net sales in emea 

gross profit margin for the year ended december 31 2015 was 424 compared to 445 in the prior year period gross margin of 445 in 2014 reflects only the period following the acquisition on october 27 2014 gross margin in the fourth quarter was 424 comparable to the third quarter of 2015 reflecting higher gross margin in services offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects 

enterprise’s operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 were 774 million and operating income was 236 million operating expenses in the fourth quarter were flat compared to third quarter however the fourth quarter was 308 of sales compared to 319 in the third quarter of 2015 due to the improved operating leverage 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the company under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available at that time 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary factors that influence our liquidity include but are not limited to the amount and timing of our revenues cash collections from our customers capital expenditures repatriation of foreign cash and investments and acquisitions of thirdparties management believes that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated in millions 



the change in our cash and cash equivalents balance is reflective of the following 

2016 vs 2015 

cash flows from operations increased  262 million  during 2016 to  372 million  this improvement was driven by lower net losses of  21 million  which included significant noncash drivers of a lower deferred income tax benefit of 98 million and asset impairment for goodwill intangibles and other assets of 69 million primarily related to the wireless lan business divestiture additionally the company had improved working capital of  85 million  during 2016 working capital improvements consisted primarily of accounts payable increases due to the company successfully renegotiating longer payment terms with vendors being partially offset by an increase in income tax cash outflows 

net cash used in investing activities during 2016 included capital expenditures of  77 million  compared to  122 million  in 2015 the decrease consisted primarily of a reduction in integration and real estate related capital expenditures this was offset somewhat by the sale of the wireless lan business resulting in net cash received of 39 million  

net cash used in financing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of early debt principal repayments of 382 million  under the term loan compared to early debt principal repayments of  165 million  in the comparable prior year period resulting from the debt refinancing amendments entered into during fiscal 2016 the company recognized 102 million of proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt offset by 102 million in payments of longterm debt within the consolidated statements of cash flows additionally proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases “espp” were  11 million  this year compared to  17 million  in 2015 reflecting decreased option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards were  8 million  in 2016 compared to  13 million  in 2015 reflecting decreased stock exercises 

in connection with the acquisition in october 2014 we incurred indebtedness totaling 325 billion as of december 31 2016 we had longterm debt gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs totaling  27 billion  we did not have any borrowings against our revolving credit facility with 246 million available 250 million less 4 million of outstanding letters of credit see note 9 longterm debt for further details and under financing activities below 

2015 vs 2014 

cash flows from operations decreased 138 million during 2015 to 110 million while an increase in net loss of 190 million netted against an increase in noncash operating items of 161 million yielded a decrease in cash flow from operations of 29 million the overall decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to changes in certain assets and liabilities of 109 million during 2015 these changes consisted primarily of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 252 million offset by a 72 million increase in accounts receivable and a 52 million increase in income taxes payable 

net cash used in investing activities during 2015 included additional consideration of 51 million paid to msi in relation to the opening cash balance and working capital adjustments in addition there were capital expenditures of 122 million in 2015 compared to 39 million in 2014 the increase in capital expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2014 consisted primarily of investments in it infrastructure software applications facilities engineering development test equipment and production and tooling equipment reflecting the effect of the acquisition on the company’s capital structure net cash used for investing activities during 2014 included 34 billion paid to msi and purchases of marketable securities of 651 million offset by 644 million and 336 million of proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments in marketable securities respectively 

net cash used in financing activities during 2015 consisted primarily of principal repayments of 165 million under the term loan compared to proceeds of 32 billion from the issuance of longterm debt to fund the acquisition during 2014 additionally proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases “espp” were 17 million this year compared to 26 million in 2014 reflecting decreased option exercises and espp purchases the taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards were 13 million in 2015 compared to 5 million in 2014 reflecting increased restricted stock exercises 

the following table shows our level of indebtedness as of december 31 2016 in millions 



private offering 

on october 15 2014 the company completed a private offering of 105 billion in 725 senior notes due october 15 2022 interest on the senior notes is payable in cash on april 15 and october 15 of each year 

the indenture covering the senior notes contains certain covenants limiting among other things the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries with certain exceptions as described in the indenture to i incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock ii incur liens iii pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock iv purchase or redeem capital stock v make investments or certain other restricted payments vi sell assets vii issue or sell stock of restricted subsidiaries viii enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates or ix effect a consolidation or merger on december 31 2016 the company was in compliance with the covenants 

credit facilities 

on october 27 2014 the company entered into a new credit agreement which provides for a term loan of 22 billion “term loan” and a revolving credit facility of 250 million “revolving credit facility” on june 2 2016 the company entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement the “refinancing amendment 1” the refinancing amendment lowered the index rate spread for libor loans from libor  400 bp to libor  325 bp during the second quarter of 2016 the company recorded a onetime 27 million expense primarily related to costs incurred with third parties for arranger legal and other services and the loss incurred on the extinguished debt these expenses are reflected as nonoperating expenses within the consolidated statement of operations additionally the company paid 49 million to the creditors in exchange for the modification and reported it as debt discount which is being amortizing over the life of the modified debt using the interest method borrowings under the modified term loan bear interest at a variable rate subject to a floor of 400 

on december 6 2016 the company entered into the second amendment to our existing credit agreement dated as of october 27 2014 the “refinancing amendment 2” the refinancing amendment lowered the index rate spread for libor loans from libor  325 bp to libor  250 bp as a result of the december 6 2016 refinancing transaction the company recorded a onetime 17 million expense primarily related to costs incurred with third parties for arranger legal and other services and the loss incurred on the modified debt the company had no costs due to creditors associated with fees for the modification 

as of december 31 2016 the term loan interest rate was 345 interest payments are payable quarterly the company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its longterm debt see note 8 derivative instruments for further details 

the credit agreement requires the company to prepay the term loan and revolving credit facility under certain circumstances or transactions defined in the credit agreement also the company may voluntarily prepay its obligations under the term loan at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty the company has made such optional principal prepayments of 382 million in 2016 through february 2017 the company made an additional optional principal prepayment 

of 20 million unless satisfied by further optional prepayments the company is required to make a scheduled principal payment of 16 billion on october 27 2021 

the revolving credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit the amount including letters of credit shall not exceed 250 million as of december 31 2016 the company had established letters of credit totaling 4 million which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to 246 million the revolving credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on october 27 2019 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 225 to 275 depending on the company’s consolidated total secured net leverage ratio which is evaluated on a quarterly basis interest payments are payable quarterly as of december 31 2016 the company did not have any borrowings outstanding against the revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants limiting among other things the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries with certain exceptions as described in the credit agreement to i incur indebtedness make guarantees or issue certain equity securities ii pay dividends on its capital stock or redeem repurchase or retire its capital stock iii make certain investments loans and acquisitions iv sell certain assets or issue capital stock of restricted subsidiaries v create liens or engage in saleleaseback transactions vi merge consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets vii engage in certain transactions with affiliates viii alter the business it conducts ix amend prepay redeem or purchase subordinated debt and x enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions the revolving credit facility also requires the company to comply with a financial covenant consisting of a quarterly maximum consolidated total secured net leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement this test is only required to be performed at the end of the fiscal quarter and when 20 of the commitments under the revolving credit facility have been drawn and remain outstanding 

the term loan and obligations under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the company’s assets as defined in the security agreement and guaranteed by its direct and indirect whollyowned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions 

certain domestic subsidiaries of the company the “guarantor subsidiaries” guarantee the notes the term loan and the revolving credit facility on a senior basis for the year ended december 31 2016 the nonguarantor subsidiaries would have a accounted for 45 of our total revenue and b held 24 or 1 billion of our total assets and approximately 12 or 04 billion of our total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities 

on december 31 2016 the company was in compliance with all covenants 

historically significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2017 we believe that our existing cash and investments borrowings available under our revolving credit facility together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating capital expenditure and debt obligation requirements for the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2016 the company’s cash position of  156 million  included foreign cash and investments of 98 million 

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 were in millions 



purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials and finished goods 

uncertain tax position liabilities of 42 million have been excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 

the company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that 5 million of unrecognized tax benefits may reverse in 2017 due to settlements with the tax authorities the company is currently undergoing audits of the 2013 through 2015 us federal income tax returns the company is engaged in an inquiry from the uk hm revenue and customs for the years 2012 and 2014 the tax years 2011 through 2016 remain open to examination by multiple foreign and us state taxing jurisdictions due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome the company’s estimates of the ultimate settlement of uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates the company continues to review these positions

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency changes zebra is exposed to the following types of market risk interest rates and foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

historically we mitigated interest rate risk on marketable security investments with an investment policy and use of outside professional investment managers our objective was to achieve stable and predictable targeted rates of return and to provide the liquidity necessary for the operations of our business 

in connection with the acquisition of enterprise zebra incurred significant debt including variable rate debt subject to interest rate caps as of december 31 2016 we had  17 billion  of debt outstanding under our term loan which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the various debt instruments we hold would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately  17 million  this amount excludes the impact of any associated derivative contracts to mitigate this risk we entered into forward interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest payments on our term loan that was used to fund the acquisition of enterprise refer to note 8 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk 

we provide products and services in over 170  countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 8 derivative instruments for further discussions of hedging activities

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework as released in 2013 based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2016 our internal control over financial reporting is effective 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in the first quarter of 2015 the company identified a material weakness related to the process to prepare and review its quarterly and annual income tax provision as a result of the increased complexity in the legal entity structure of the business following the enterprise acquisition a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the impact of this material weakness contributed to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the yearended december 31 2015 the threemonths ended april 2016 and the three and six months ended july 2 2016with the identification of the material weakness associated with the preparation and review process of our quarterly and annual tax provision in 2015 we began implementing a remediation plan to address these issues this plan included the implementation of improved and documented processes and procedures as well as hiring additional accounting and tax professionals 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 40 of this report on form 10k 

except as noted above there have been no other changes in our internal controls that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls 

must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been prevented or detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

acquisition of enterprise business 

in october 2014 zebra acquired the enterprise business “enterprise” excluding its iden or integrated digital enhanced network business from motorola solutions inc “msi” for 345 billion in cash the “acquisition” enterprise is an industry leader in mobile computing and advanced data capture technologies and services which complement zebra’s printing and rfid products its products include rugged and enterprisegrade mobile computers barcode scanners and rfid readers wlan solutions and accessories software and services that are associated with these products enterprise service revenues include sales arising from maintenance repair product support system installation and integration services and other services 

the acquisition expanded zebra’s product lines with complementary products that together are employed by customers to obtain greater visibility and insights into their operations it enables us to deliver endtoend solutions supporting the iot in targeted industries we believe that the expanded capabilities of the combined company make zebra a more valued strategic supplier to endusers as well as a more important supplier of products and solutions to our channel partners 

similar to zebra’s business prior to the acquisition enterprise’s products and services are sold to a wide range of enterprise customers globally including those in the retail transportation and logistics manufacturing healthcare hospitality warehouse and distribution energy and utilities and education industries 

zebra funded the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand of 250 million the sale of 725 senior notes due 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of 105 billion the “senior notes” and a new credit agreement with various lenders that provided a term loan of 22 billion the “term loan” due 2021 the new credit agreement also included a 250 million revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and together with the senior notes and the term loan the “debt agreements” 

integration of enterprise business 

since closing the acquisition in october 2014 integration activities by the company have focused on creating “one zebra” by integrating the operations of enterprise with legacy zebra to create a single business with common sales marketing finance supply chain information technology it and other functions our priorities have centered on maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing cost synergies and integrating functional organizations and processes another key focus of the integration has been to conclude msiprovided transition service agreements “tsa” related primarily to it support services these tsas are an interim measure to facilitate the integration of enterprise and enable us to continue operating enterprise without disruption we also completed the integration of our sales organization and sales channel in 2015 we began a legal entity rationalization program and terminated 29 entities that were either acquired in the acquisition or legacy entities that zebra owned preacquisition 

during 2015 significant progress was made in the areas of organizational design and culture development including integrating all functional organizations across zebra into a unified organizational structure we also completed a global roll out of a new zebra brand implemented systems for our sales and engineering teams and consolidated a number of real estate sites 

these efforts resulted in the elimination of a significant number of enterprise it applications and closure of a significant number of tsas 

additional integration work remains to be completed primarily in the area of it infrastructure and business systems including implementation of a common enterprise resource planning “erp” system as well as systems to support our services business and network of channel partners until such time that zebra is able to complete its transition to common systems legacy zebra and enterprise will continue to operate largely on separate systems including separate erp systems the it integration when completed will result in a modernized and rightsized it network and streamlined business processes we expect to make continued progress on the it integration throughout 2016 which will include implementation of the initial stages of a phased erp implementation completion of the it integration including a common erp system is expected before the end of 2017 and will enable us to terminate the remaining tsas we also expect a more efficient and cost effective it network improved operational productivity and reduced costs

intellectual property 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents trademarks copyrights and contractual rights to establish and protect its innovations and holds a large portfolio of intellectual property rights in the united states and other countries as of december 31 2015 zebra and its whollyowned subsidiaries owned approximately 900 trademark registrations 680 trademark applications 3600 patents and 950 patent applications worldwide zebra continues to actively seek to obtain patents and trademarks whenever possible and practical to secure intellectual property rights in its innovations 

we believe that our intellectual property will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage for future technologies we also believe that we are not dependent upon any single patent or select group of patents our success depends more upon our extensive knowhow innovative culture technical leadership and 

marketing and sales abilities although we do not rely only on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position we will enforce our intellectual property rights when and where appropriate 

employees 

as of january 31 2016 zebra employed approximately 7000 persons of which 670 were corporate employees some portions of our business primarily in europe and china are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from those in the united states in europe for example it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation benefits restructurings and layoffs we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 

regulatory matters 

wireless regulatory matters 

our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters 

the use of wireless voice data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world in the us the federal communications commission “fcc” and the national telecommunications and information administration “ntia” regulate spectrum use by nonfederal entities and federal entities respectively similarly countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the international telecommunications union we manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies these include voice and data infrastructure mobile radios and portable or hand held devices consequently our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from timetotime by the fcc ntia or regulatory agencies in other countries our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum the availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities and consequently the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed 

other regulatory matters 

some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal state local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites certain products are subject to various federal state local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products during 2015 compliance with us federal state and local and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

risk factors 

tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects these risks are not the only risks we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 

we have organized the risk factors into three sections 1 risks related to our business 2 risks related to the acquisition and integration of enterprise and 3 risks related to our indebtedness 

risks related to our business 

zebra has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of its products outside of the us and purchases important components including final products from foreign suppliers shipments to nonus customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales zebra also expects to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with nonus production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 zebra may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change  to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

  

 future success will depend on zebra’s ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra participates in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements  zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its products and solutions some competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to effectively and economically provide 

  

 zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in mobile computing products data capture products printers wlan products and solutions or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on zebra’s competitive position in the marketplace 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through the acquisition and worldwide growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business the following factors could present difficulties to zebra 

  

 inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price  zebra’s ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results  zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business these and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 

  

 future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly  third parties may claim that zebra or zebra’s suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a thirdparty’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result zebra’s products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged  zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages zebra uses copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of zebra’s intellectual property and its products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information which zebra regards as its trade secrets additionally the intellectual property rights zebra obtains may not be sufficient to provide it with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged invalidated circumvented or infringed in any infringement litigation that zebra may undertake to protect its intellectual property any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain and any such award zebra may receive may not be commercially valuable furthermore efforts to enforce or protect zebra’s proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result 

in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of zebra’s intellectual property and incurring substantial litigation costs because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of zebra’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation some aspects of zebra’s business and services also rely on technologies software and content developed by or licensed from third parties and zebra may not be able to maintain its relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

we currently use third party andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products such parties ceasing continued development of the operating system or restricting our access to such operating system could adversely impact our business and financial results  we currently use thirdparty andor open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products as a result we are dependent on thirdparties’ continued development of operating systems software application ecosystem infrastructures and such thirdparties’ approval of our implementations of their operating system and associated applications if such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems we would be required to change our strategy for such devices as a result our financial results could be negatively impacted because a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult a strategy shift could increase the burden of development on zebra and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time which could competitively disadvantage zebra 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations  like many companies zebra continually strives to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we regularly perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection and implement and manage disaster recovery testing a cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption “phishing” and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat 

a cybersecurity incident including deliberate attacks and unintentional events may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems to the loss or corruption of confidential business information andor to the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to the zebra brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at zebra if zebra’s core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems andor data 

zebra products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems it is possible that such a breach could result in delays in or loss of market acceptance of zebra’s products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed product base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed product base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

defects or errors in zebra’s software products could harm its reputation result in significant cost to zebra and impair zebra’s ability to market such products  zebra’s software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although zebra has not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner it is possible that errors defects or bugs will be found in zebra’s existing or future software products and related services with the possible results of delays in or loss of market acceptance of zebra’s products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

zebra depends on the ongoing services of its senior management and its ability to attract and retain key personnel  the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability  the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets since then a number of significant acts of terrorism have occurred and war continues in the middle east all of which may contribute to instability in financial markets additional acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves  zebra is subject to and may become subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate and cash flows future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on zebra’s effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates  forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions t he european union and countries within the european union are contemplating changes to their respective tax laws based on the recent reports issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecdg20 base erosion and profit shifting beps project which if enacted could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations within europe our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business general disruption of financial markets similar to the disruption in financial markets from 2008 through 2009 and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsourced manufacturers and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan  and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  natural disasters similar to the earthquake that struck japan in march 2011 may occur in the future and zebra is not able to predict to 

what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business and results of operations 

zebra is exposed to risks under large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact its business zebra enters into large multiyear system and solutions and services contracts with our customers this exposes zebra to risks including among others i technological risks especially when the contracts involve new technology ii financial risks including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large longterm contracts and the related impact on operating results and iii cyber security risk especially in managed services contracts with customers that process personal data recovery of front loaded capital expenditures in longterm managed services contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers the insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product which could have an adverse impact on zebra’s profitability 

zebra enters into fixedprice contracts that could subject it to losses in the event zebra fails to properly estimate its costs  zebra enters into a number of firm fixedprice contracts if zebra’s initial cost estimates are incorrect zebra can lose money on these contracts because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require zebra to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years unforeseen events such as technological difficulties fluctuations in the price of raw materials problems with zebra’s subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to zebra and have an adverse impact on zebra’s financial results in addition a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longerterm contracts 

zebra utilizes the services of subcontractors to perform under many of its contracts and the inability of its subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact zebra’s performance obligations as the prime contractor  zebra engages subcontractors on many of its contracts and as zebra expands its global solutions and services business zebra’s use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase zebra’s subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply thirdparty products and software zebra may have disputes with its subcontractors including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or its subcontractors and the functionality warranty and indemnities of products software and services supplied by zebra’s subcontractor zebra is not always successful in passing along customer requirements to its subcontractors and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from its customers without corresponding backtoback coverage from zebra’s subcontractor zebra’s subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials components subsystems and services they supply or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers which might result in greater product returns service problems warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues and could harm zebra’s business financial condition and results of operations 

over the last several years we have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair distribution and engineering services and may outsource additional business operations which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners  as we outsource more of our business operations we are not able to directly control these activities our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service cost reductions or other metrics in some cases their actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations like import or export regulations as many of our outsource partners operate outside of the us our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks in addition we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners once a business activity is outsourced we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the company or move it to another outsource partner the actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results 

failure of zebra’s suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business  it is zebra’s policy to require its suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers and thirdparty sales representatives “tpsrs” to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices environmental compliance anticorruption and trademark and copyright licensing however zebra does not control their labor and other business practices if one of zebra’s suppliers subcontractors distributors resellers or tpsrs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical the shipment of finished products to zebra could be interrupted orders could be canceled relationships could be terminated and zebra’s reputation could be damaged if one of zebra’s suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks copyrights or patents legal action could be taken against zebra that could impact the saleability of zebra’s products and expose zebra to financial obligations to a thirdparty any of these events could have a negative impact on zebra’s sales and results of operations 

zebra relies on thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers to sell many of its products  in addition to zebra’s own sales force zebra offers its products through a variety of thirdparty dealers distributors and resellers these thirdparties may also 

market other products that compete with zebra’s products failure of one or more of zebra’s dealers distributors or resellers to effectively promote zebra’s products could affect our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations as zebra implements a new channel program that covers both legacy zebra and enterprise products some of our thirdparty dealers distributors or resellers may decide not to migrate to the new channel program thereby reducing our ability to bring products to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

some of these thirdparties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for thirdparty dealers distributors or retailers and we are unable to successfully transition endcustomers to purchase our products from other thirdparties or from zebra directly it may cause and in some cases has caused a negative impact on our financial results 

final assembly of certain zebra products is performed by thirdparty electronics manufacturers zebra may be dependent on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results because zebra relies on these thirdparty electronics manufacturers to manufacture its products zebra may incur increased business continuity risks  zebra is not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of its products if these third party manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without such third parties continuing to manufacture zebra’s products zebra may have no other means of final assembly of certain of its products until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers going forward 

zebra’s future operating results depend on its ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials parts and components as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers zebra sources some of its components from sole source suppliers any disruption to its suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on its results of operations  zebra’s ability to meet customers’ demands depends in part on its ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials parts and components as well as services and software from its suppliers in addition certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and zebra may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner if demand for zebra’s products or services increases from its current expectations or if suppliers are unable to meet zebra’s demand for other reasons including as a result of natural disasters or financial issues zebra could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on its business zebra has experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted its results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future in addition credit constraints at zebra’s suppliers could cause zebra to accelerate payment of accounts payable by zebra impacting zebra’s cash flow 

in addition zebra’s current contractual with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and therefore not afford zebra with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies moreover in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with zebra zebra’s legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate zebra for any damages it may suffer 

the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation arbitration or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s financial condition or results of operations  from time to time zebra is made a party to litigation arbitration or administrative actions zebra’s financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings in addition it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact zebra’s financial results 

it is important that zebra is able to obtain many different types of insurance and if zebra is not able to obtain insurance or exhausts its coverage zebra may be forced to retain the risk  zebra has many types of insurance coverage and is also selfinsured for some risks and obligations while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain such as professional liability insurance which is expensive to obtain for the amount of coverage often requested by certain customers as zebra grows its global solutions and services business zebra 

is being asked to obtain higher amounts of professional liability insurance which could result in higher costs to do business natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims professional liability and public liability are potential selfinsured events that could negatively impact zebra’s financial results in addition while zebra maintains insurance for certain risks the amount of its insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and zebra may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident incident or claim 

zebra is subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws  zebra’s operations and the products it manufactures andor sells are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety consumer worker safety and environmental laws and regulations compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject zebra to future costs or liabilities impact its production capabilities constrict its ability to sell expand or acquire facilities restrict what products and services zebra can offer and generally impact its financial performance some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use disposal remediation emission and discharge of and exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault zebra continues to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on zebra’s operations or financial performance 

laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories recycling of both electronic products and packaging reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products standardization of connectors and power supplies the transportation of lithiumion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating there are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety radio interference radio frequency radiation exposure medical related functionality and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment these laws and changes to these laws could have a substantial impact on whether zebra can offer certain products solutions and services and on what capabilities and characteristics zebra’s products or services can or must include 

these laws impact zebra’s products and negatively affect zebra’s ability to manufacture and sell products competitively zebra expects these trends to continue in addition zebra anticipates that it will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products increasing energy efficiency and providing additional accessibility 

zebra has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting which could if not remediated result in material misstatements in its financial statements  zebra’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over its financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act as disclosed in item 9a of part ii of this report zebra identified in the first quarter of 2015 a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the process to review and prepare its quarterly income tax provision a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of this material weakness zebra’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the last day of the period covered by this report zebra is actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness if the remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the internal control are discovered or occur in the future the consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and zebra could be required to restate its financial results 

zebra could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses including but not limited to revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories customer rebates and other customer consideration tax matters and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition new accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs andor change our financial statements for example implementing future accounting guidance related to revenue and other areas could require us to make significant changes to our accounts receivable subledger or other accounting systems and could result in adverse changes to our financial statements 

risks related to the acquisition and integration of enterprise 

zebra may be unable to effectively integrate enterprise into its existing business  the integration of enterprise into zebra’s operations is a significant undertaking and requires significant attention from zebra’s management the acquisition with an approximate enterprise value of 345 billion is significantly larger than prior acquisitions zebra has completed and significantly increased the size of zebra’s operations increased its number of employees and operating facilities and expanded its geographic scope there can be no assurance that zebra will be able to successfully integrate enterprise or if such integration is successfully accomplished that such integration will not be more costly than currently contemplated there can also be no assurance that zebra can successfully manage the combined business due to zebra’s greatly increased size and scope if zebra cannot successfully integrate and manage enterprise within a reasonable time following the acquisition zebra may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits of the acquisition which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

zebra may be unable to realize the expected growth opportunities and cost savings from the acquisition  in connection with the integration of enterprise into zebra’s existing operating structure zebra seeks to realize growth opportunities along with cost savings the anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about zebra’s ability to implement integration measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters zebra’s ability to achieve the planned cost synergies relies upon a number of factors some of which may be beyond its control for example zebra may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs in a timely fashion or at all zebra’s inability to realize anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements from the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

the acquisition could divert the attention of management zebra entered new lines of business that it lacks experience managing after completing the acquisition similarly because enterprise is significantly larger than zebra’s business prior to the acquisition zebra will be required to manage new and larger lines of business and consequently the integration process requires significant attention from management which may divert management’s attention from zebra’s other businesses management may also have difficulty assimilating the corporate cultures maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees these diversions together with other difficulties zebra may have in integrating enterprise could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

customers of enterprise or legacy zebra may decide to diversify their supply of products provided by enterprise andor legacy zebra by switching to competitors  some of zebra’s existing customers may conclude that as a result of the acquisition they are overly reliant on a single provider in such circumstances zebra’s customers may engage its competitors or facilitate the emergence of new competitors to diversify sourcing and service options which could have an adverse effect on zebra’s expected revenues following the acquisition 

zebra continues to rely on msi to perform certain critical transition services and there can be no assurance that those services will be performed timely and effectively or that zebra can replace those services prior to the expiration of the transition services agreement or successfully develop its own operations going forward  under the terms of the transition services agreement that zebra entered into with msi in connection with the acquisition msi provided and continues to provide zebra with services critical for the operation and continuity of zebras operation of enterprise zebra has transitioned some of these critical functions and is in the process of transitioning other critical functions which primarily include information technology systems until zebra transitions all such functions it will continue to rely on msi for those services there can be no assurances that these remaining services will be performed timely and effectively or that zebra will be able to successfully or timely transition remaining functions and assume responsibility over them significant disruption in these transition services or unanticipated costs related to these services could materially and adversely affect zebra’s business financial condition and results of operations additionally if we are unable to transition such remaining services to zebra in a timely fashion or without disruption to zebra’s operations we could experience an adverse effect on our business financial condition and cash flows and results of operations 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to report on our assessment as to the effectiveness of these controls any negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement particularly with respect to areas of our business impacted by the integration of our business processes systems and facilities we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure appropriate implementation and maintenance of adequate internal controls over the financial reporting processes and reporting in the future we may incur significant additional costs in order to ensure we adequately remediate any weaknesses identified in our internal control environment which in turn would reduce our earnings implementing any remedial measures may be complicated by the limited timeframe in which to implement such measures the possibility that implementation of such measures may require a substantial amount of work and time by zebra personnel and the challenge of migrating to a new erp while implementing such remedial measures in addition development of an integrated financial reporting system with the accompanying system of 

internal controls to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 may increase the time and costs necessary to complete the integration of enterprise or cause us to miss our reporting obligations 

any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements failure to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities in addition failure to comply with our reporting obligations with the sec may cause an event of default to occur under the debt agreements or similar instruments governing any debt we or our subsidiaries incur in the future 

as part of the integration zebra is moving enterprise off of its legacy erp systems and implementing an erp system under a single instance with zebra’s legacy business the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems including moving enterprise off of its legacy systems that are being operated under a transition services agreement with msi with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will enhance a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that often continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could in the future become impaired and result in material noncash charges to our results of operations as of december 31 2015 we had 32 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets a significant increase since prior to the acquisition of enterprise at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by gaap we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount estimated fair values could change if for example there are changes in the business climate unanticipated changes in the competitive environment declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments changes in capital structure cost of debt interest rates capital expenditure levels operating cash flows or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our results of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness 

in connection with the acquisition zebra incurred substantial debt obligations  zebra’s total outstanding debt for borrowed money was approximately 325 billion on october 27 2014 at december 31 2015 the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was 309 billion in addition subject to restrictions in agreements governing zebra’s existing and future indebtedness zebra may incur additional indebtedness zebra’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  

 20 

 zebra expects to fund its expenses and to pay the principal and interest on its indebtedness from cash flow from operations zebra’s ability to meet its expenses and to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness when due depends on its future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors zebra will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions in the markets where zebra operates and pressure from competitors additionally zebra has not previously undertaken substantial amounts of indebtedness historically zebra operated its business without incurring significant indebtedness for borrowed money and has limited experience operating its business subject to the constraints imposed by debt agreements 

despite its indebtedness zebra may need to incur substantially more indebtedness and take other actions that could further exacerbate the risk associated with its existing indebtedness  at december 31 2015 the remaining principal amount of indebtedness was 309 billion in addition to the financing activities zebra may need to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future resulting in higher leverage subject to the limits contained in its debt agreements zebra may incur additional indebtedness from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes to the extent zebra incurs additional indebtedness the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness will be exacerbated 

zebra’s use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in its quarterly operating results  zebra does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes however zebra does utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with its indebtedness to manage variable interest rate risk zebra entered into forward interest rate swap agreements which will effectively convert a portion of its indebtedness into a fixed rate loan under generally accepted accounting principles the fair values of the swap contracts which will either be amounts receivable from or payable to counterparties are reflected as either assets or liabilities on zebra’s consolidated balance sheets zebra records its fair value change in our consolidated statements of earnings as a component of “other income expense” if not hedged the associated impact on zebra’s quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates if interest rates increase zebra would have a noncash gain on the swaps and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates consequently these swap contracts introduce complexity to zebra’s operating results 

restrictive covenants in the debt agreements may limit zebra’s current and future operations particularly its ability to respond to changes in its business or to pursue its business strategies the debt agreements contain and instruments governing any future indebtedness may contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions including restrictions on zebra’s ability to take actions that zebra believes may be in its interest zebra expects these covenants will limit its ability to 

 additionally the term loan entered into to fund a portion of the acquisition requires zebra to maintain in certain circumstances compliance with a consolidated total secured net leverage ratio zebra’s ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond its control and zebra cannot assure you that zebra will meet this ratio the restrictions could adversely affect zebra’s ability to 

  

 a breach of any of the covenants contained in the debt agreements including an inability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants that is not remedied within the applicable cure period if any would result in an event of default under 

the debt agreements if when required zebra is unable to repay or refinance its indebtedness or amend the covenants contained in the debt agreements or if a default otherwise occurs that is not cured or waived the lenders or holders of zebra debt securities could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable or institute foreclosure proceedings against those assets that secure the borrowings should the outstanding obligations be accelerated and become due and payable because of any failure to comply with the applicable covenants in the future zebra would be required to search for alternative measures to finance current and ongoing obligations of its business there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms if at all any of these scenarios could adversely impact zebra’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

a significant amount of cash will be required to service our indebtedness  zebra’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund working capital needs general corporate expenditures and planned capital expenditures depends on zebra’s ability to generate a significant amount of cash this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive business legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond zebra’s control 

if zebra’s business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to zebra in an amount sufficient to enable zebra to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs zebra may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s operations in addition zebra may not be able to affect any of these actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all zebra’s ability to restructure or refinance its indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and its financial condition at such time any refinancing of its indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require zebra to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent zebra from taking any of these actions in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest andor principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of zebra’s credit rating which could harm its ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all zebra’s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure its obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on zebra’s business financial condition and results of operations as well as on its ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of its indebtedness

the revolving credit facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit the amount including letters of credit shall not exceed 250 million as of december 31 2015 the company had established letters of credit totaling 3 million which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to 247 million the revolving credit facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate on october 27 2019 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from 225 to 275 depending on the company’s consolidated total secured net leverage ratio which is evaluated on a quarterly basis interest payments are payable quarterly as of december 31 2015 the company did not have any borrowings against the revolving credit facility

on december 31 2015 the company was in compliance with all covenants 

historically significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations we currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2016 we believe that our existing cash and investments borrowings available under our revolving credit facility together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating capital expenditure and debt obligation requirements for the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2015 the companys cash position of 192 million included foreign cash and investments of 166 million 

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements

tableend market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency changes zebra is exposed to the following types of market risk interest rates and foreign currency 

interest rate risk 

historically we mitigated interest rate risk on marketable security investments with an investment policy and use of outside professional investment managers our objective was to achieve stable and predictable targeted rates of return and to provide the liquidity necessary for the operation of the business 

in connection with the acquisition of enterprise zebra incurred significant debt including variable rate debt subject to interest rate caps as of december 31 2015 we had 2 billion of debt outstanding under our term loan which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index to mitigate this risk we entered into forward interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest payments on our term loan that was used to fund the acquisition of enterprise refer to note 13 derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

foreign exchange risk

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the evaluation was conducted under the supervision of its disclosure committee and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation the company has concluded that due to a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as described below its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2015 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework as released in 2013 based on this assessment our management believes that as of december 31 2015 our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due to the identification of a material weakness 

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in the internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

as of the first quarter of 2015 the company identified a material weakness related to the process to prepare and review its quarterly and annual income tax provision the material weakness relates to deficiencies in the design and operation of controls in response to the increased complexity in the legal entity structure of the business following the enterprise acquisition these deficiencies impacted our ability to accurately forecast pretax income and deferred taxes by legal entity in a timely manner 

this material weakness did not result in the restatement of prior quarterly or annually filed financial statements 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal controls over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 39 of this report on form 10k 

remediation plan 

management and the board of directors are committed to the continued improvement of the company’s overall system of internal controls over financial reporting our remediation plan which started during 2015 is to implement additional processes controls and procedures relating to the preparation and review process of our quarterly and annual income tax provision we will continue to implement remedial measures to improve and develop internal controls processes and procedures in the income tax provision process in order to address the material weakness 

the identification review assessment and remediation of internal control deficiencies is overseen by senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors and is undertaken primarily through the integration of processes and procedures with existing company processes and procedures development and implementation of formal policies improved processes and documented procedures as well as the hiring of additional finance and tax personnel 

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

in 2015 the company expanded the scope of management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting to include the newly acquired enterprise business and related business processes and systems this has included the addition of internal controls over financial reporting which may have been in operation previously but which were not relied upon in prior years by the company for purposes of supporting management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting this has also included the addition of new corporatelevel internal controls over financial reporting in response to process and system related changes associated with the acquisition of enterprise 

during the quarter covered by this report there have been no other changes in the internal controls that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the internal controls over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

zebra’s technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to help identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines incorporate thermal printing technology either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this form of thermal printing technology benefits applications requiring simple and reliable operations such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this form of thermal printing technology allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications such as circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels that require resistance to chemicals extreme temperatures abrasion or labels requiring a long shelf life most of our printers in our high performance midrange print engine desktop and mobile categories use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation card printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye that is absorbed into a plastic card retransfer film or treated paper this process creates fullcolor photographic quality images that are wellsuited for driver’s licenses access and identification cards transaction cards ondemand photographs and financial cards credit debit and atm cards 

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speeds making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable barcodes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband 

  

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and printer operating systems enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure the durability of our printers special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift our printer operating systems support serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211abgn wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as the zebra programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml these features make our printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars direct marketers and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts for media and consumables we sell directly to end users through the internet and inside operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow us to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries we experience a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region and industry served 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in specific industries we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete and more effectively offer our solutions to a greater number of end users 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when the customer is in a targeted highgrowth industry with applications using zebra solutions that span multiple product categories zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our channel partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a team that manages three global alliances they direct the business development strategies for thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

marketing marketing operations encompass global corporate marketing field marketing product marketing industry marketing market research and channel marketing functions corporate marketing manages our zebra brand globally corporate public relations internal communications and our web site corporate marketing is also responsible for market research and planning and industry marketing product marketing focuses on market analysis positioning product launch support and analyzes zebra’s competitive position field marketing encompasses demand generation channel program management and marketing and sales enablement 

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship 

final assembly of our printer products is performed by jabil circuit inc a thirdparty electronics manufacturer jabil produces our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order we maintain control over portions of the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of key components jabil is responsible for the procurement of the components and subassemblies used in the zebra printers it produces zebra has a subsidiary located in guangzhou china and has an office located near the jabil facility in china where our products are assembled this office is staffed with our sourcing engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal raw material pricing manufacturing process controls are maintained and the final printers meet our quality standards the majority of our printers manufactured by jabil are shipped to our regional distribution centers a portion of products are reconfigured at zebra’s distribution centers through firmware downloads packaging and customer specific customization before they are shipped to customers in addition certain products are manufactured in accordance with federal procurement regulations and various international trade agreements and remain eligible for sale to the united states government 

  

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of barcode label printers rfid printerencoders card personalization and active rfidreal time locating system rtls solutions 

we consider our direct competition in barcode label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems printerencoders mobile printers and supplies we also compete with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as inkjet and laser printing many of these companies are substantially larger than zebra 

dye sublimation the technology used in our card printers is only one of several commercially available processes used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than us in addition service bureaus compete for enduser business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

we compete with a diverse group of small companies marketing rtls solutions 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition in our printing business from many printer companies including the following listed in alphabetical order argox avery dennison bixolon blue bamboo boca systems brother international canon cim citizen cognitive tpg custom danaher datacard datamaxo’neil a unit of dover corporation dymo a newell rubbermaid company epson evolis fargo electronics a unit of hid global godex hewlettpackard hitachi honeywell international inc lexmark international magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs technologies nisca oki data olympus practical automation printronix sato seiko instruments song woo electronics sony star micronics taiwan semiconductor toshiba tec victor data systems woosim and xerox 

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

zebra’s competitors in the location solutions products include aeroscout ekahau and ubisense 

alternative printing technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the preferred label card and receipt printer technology in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as complementary technologies to barcoded printing offering growth opportunities for zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

if other technologies were to evolve or become available it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors our products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of barcode printing and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be certain that a new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge 

  

customers 

zebra had three customers that accounted for 10 or more of its sales all three of these customers are distributors and not end users our net sales to significant customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

sales 

net sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

 net sales to international customers as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

 

 the percentage of international sales decreased in 2012 and 2013 due to the laserband acquisition in july of 2012 which principally sells in north america however organically international sales are likely to increase faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america and western europe as well as generally higher economic growth rates in developing countries as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 30 different countries 

research and development 

zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 we devote significant resources to developing new innovative solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our products and solutions maintain high levels of reliability and value to our customers 

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents trademarks copyrights and contractual rights to establish and protect its innovations we hold over 200 domestic and international trademarks we hold over 700 united states and foreign patents and patent applications the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

  

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success 

other trademarks mentioned in this report are the property of their respective holders and include unix a registered trademark of unix systems laboratories msdos and windows registered trademarks of microsoft sap a registered trademark of sap ag and linux a registered trademark of linus torvalds bluetooth is a trademark owned by bluetooth sig and used by zebra under license 

employees 

as of january 25 2014 zebra employed approximately 2583 persons of which 265 were corporate employees none of our employees are members of a union some portions of our business primarily in europe and china are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from those in the united states for example in europe it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation benefits or terminations of employment we consider our employee relations to be very good

 item 1a risk factors tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

final assembly of our thermal printers and most of our location solutions products is performed by jabil circuit a thirdparty electronics manufacturer we are dependent on jabil as a solesource of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results because we rely on a thirdparty provider such as jabil to manufacture our products zebra may incur increased business continuity risks zebra is not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of its thermal printers and location solutions products if jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers and location solutions products until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers going forward 

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components including final products from foreign suppliers zebra has significant operations outside of the united states which create significant risks in addition zebra sells a substantial amount of its products to customers outside of the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales zebra also expects to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with overseas production and assembly operations for our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

           customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery zebra monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns zebra however cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

  

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

     future success will depend on zebra’s ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its products and solutions some competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to effectively and economically provide 

 

    zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on zebra’s competitive position in the marketplace 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

        inability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price zebra’s ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to unreasonable asking prices competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms 

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 

  

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including 

 

       future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect our financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a thirdparty’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result zebra’s products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of zebra’s intellectual property and its products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information which zebra regards as its trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

zebra’s products are subject to us and nonus foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent us from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations like many companies zebra continually strives to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business we regularly perform vulnerability assessments remediate vulnerabilities review logaccess perform system maintenance manage network perimeter protection and implement and manage disaster recovery testing 

a cyberattack that breaches our external perimeter may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems andor lead to the loss or corruption of confidential business information that could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to the zebra brand this could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence 

  

while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents there have been no material incidents incurred todate at zebra if zebra’s core business operations or that of one of our thirdparty service providers were to be breached this could affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data while we continue to perform security due diligence there is always the possibility of a significant breach effecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems andor data 

zebra products that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality integrity and availability of the customer’s data and systems 

defects or errors in zebra’s software products could harm its reputation result in significant cost to zebra and impair zebra’s ability to market such products zebra’s software may contain undetected errors defects or bugs although zebra has not suffered significant harm from any errors defects or bugs to date we may discover significant errors defects or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner it is possible that errors defects or bugs will be found in zebra’s existing or future software products and related services with the possible results of delays in or loss of market acceptance of zebra’s products and services diversion of our resources injury to our reputation increased service and warranty expenses and payment of damages 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets the possibility of further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on zebra’s effective tax rate foreign rate differential future income tax expense and cash flows 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption from 2008 through 2009 resulting in historically high volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations a recurrence of these developments and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan  and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and cash flows 

a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations as reported a powerful earthquake centered off the northeastern coast of japan on march 11 2011 resulted in the loss of many lives widespread damage to and destruction of property disruption of electric power and the release of radiation from a crippled nuclear power plant this devastation disrupted the operations to varying degrees of companies with business activity in the affected region including the business of zebra suppliers other natural disasters may occur in the future and zebra is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business and results of operations

sales by product category were as follows amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

   

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

 

 for the fourth quarter of 2013 unit volumes increased across all printer categories the decrease in average selling price is a result of a change in product mix toward lower priced products in the 2013 quarter compared to the corresponding 2012 quarter

 gross profit 

gross profit increased 133 for the fourth quarter of 2013 versus the fourth quarter of 2012 as a percentage of sales gross margin increased from 492 to 496 primarily due to higher volume favorable foreign currency movements net of hedges increased fourth quarter gross profit by 1672000 

operating expenses

operating expenses 

operating expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

 

 operating expenses for 2013 increased 49 the increase is due to increased expenses across all functional areas offset by the absence of a goodwill impairment charge which represents 28 of 2012 operating expenses the acquisition of both laserband and stepone contributed to the increase in zebra’s operating expenses several categories accounted for these increases including compensation costs outside professional services depreciation and information systems expenses acquisition costs are related to investigated and completed acquisitions during the period amortization of intangible assets increased from additions of current technology patent and patent rights and customer relationships during the year including the acquisition of laserband in july 2012 exit and restructuring costs in 2012 and 2013 primarily relate to the restructuring of the location solutions business management structure 

  

exit and restructuring costs 

during the third quarter of 2012 revenue from location solutions fell below plan from slower than anticipated growth in the automotive and process manufacturing industries and weakness in the government sector as a result we initiated the locations solutions 2012 restructuring plan 

in the second quarter of 2013 management determined that additional restructuring actions would be required to meet our financial goals for the location solutions business we anticipate that the results of our restructuring actions will reduce costs of the location solutions business by 4000000 per year these savings should be fully realized by the first quarter 2014 the savings from the location solutions restructuring plan will primarily benefit cost of goods sold engineering and selling and marketing expenses 

during 2007 zebra began a plan to outsource printer manufacturing to a thirdparty contract manufacturer the transition to the thirdparty manufacturer was completed during 2010 during the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined that further supply chain cost reductions were possible by moving certain supply chain support operations closer to our contract printer manufacturer’s facility which is located in china we anticipate these actions will generate 2600000 in annual savings to our cost of goods sold these actions were completed by the end of 2013 

operating income 

the operating income decrease for 2013 was the result of operating expense increases as noted above and partially offset by higher gross profit 

other income expense 

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 the increase in other income is the result of a net 1557000 favorable litigation settlement associated with an investment loss that was recorded in prior years 

 

 investment income decreased due to a lower yield on invested financial assets compared with 2012 even though cash and investment balances were higher in 2013 versus 2012 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for 2013 was 181 compared with an income tax rate of 258 the 2012 rate reflects a discrete item for nondeductible asset impairment charge increasing the tax rate by 19 for the full year further in 2012 in order to streamline the management financing and capital structure of its foreign affiliates zebra established a foreign holding company and restructured the ownership structure of its foreign affiliates this new holding company structure allows zebra to consolidate the ownership of its significant foreign affiliates under a single holding company in addition the structure introduced leverage which gives zebra the ability to facilitate cash pooling and improve the capital structure of its nonus operations the new capital structure and global financing favorably impacts the zebra’s effective tax rate and facilitates the tax efficient movement of zebra’s foreign cash to finance the ongoing operating and investment needs of the foreign subsidiaries the restructuring was completed in the second quarter of 2012 and was in place for the full year in 2013 in addition the us rd credit reinstatement for the 2012 income tax year resulted in a tax benefit of 900000 finally zebra recorded a favorable provision to return adjustment resulting in a reduction to the effective tax rate of 11 following the filing of zebra’s 2012 income tax returns

sales by product category were as follows amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 sales increased in latin america due to improved geographic coverage with notable increases in supplies mobile and card printer sales compared to 2011 sales in north america increased due to increased sales of supplies and continued demand for desktop card and tabletop printers zebra continues to build a broader base of customers to penetrate targeted industries more deeply movements in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 12139000 in the europe middle east and africa regions due principally to a weaker euro against the us dollar 

  

sales to customers by geographic region were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 gross profit 

gross profit increased 10 due to higher volumes and lower material costs lower freight costs in 2012 of 5042000 versus 2011 helped improve gross profit while unfavorable movements in foreign currency decreased gross profit by 9923000 the above factors contributed to the slight decrease in gross margin from 495 to 494 

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for 2012 was 258 compared with an income tax rate of 275 for 2011 during 2012 zebra established a foreign holding company structure that is designed to accomplish various international business objectives this new holding company structure allows zebra to consolidate the ownership of its significant foreign affiliates under a single holding company in addition the structure introduced leverage and gives zebra the ability to facilitate cash pooling for its nonus operations this favorably impacts the zebra’s effective tax rate and provides for the tax efficient movement of cash within the structure to efficiently deploy cash generated by the foreign subsidiaries for various uses including potential acquisitions the structure was put in place in the second quarter of 2012 these reductions were offset by a discrete item in the third quarter of 2012 related to a nondeductible asset impairment charge which increased the effective tax rate for 2012 by 19 the rate in 2011 included a tax valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2011 against a subsequently divested subsidiary

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment except in asia where the terms are fob destination provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

    maintenance and support agreements 

we enter into postcontract maintenance and support agreements revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

the composition of investments and marketable securities at december 31 2013 was as follows 

 

  

   

trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized 

zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale except for securities held in zebra’s deferred compensation plan which are considered to be trading securities investments in marketable debt securities are classified based on intent and ability to sell investment securities zebra’s availableforsale securities are used to fund future acquisitions and other operating needs and therefore can be sold prior to maturity investments in marketable debt securities for which zebra intends to sell within the next year are classified as current and those that we intend to hold in excess of oneyear are classified as noncurrent 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

      we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 03 to 09 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2013 were 453000 or 03 of the balance due we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2013 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 88 to 119 of gross inventory as of december 31 2013 inventory reserves were 12561000 or 94 of gross inventory we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2013 

valuation of goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year as of the end of may or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our annual qualitative assessment in accordance with asu 201108 goodwill and other topic 350  during june 2013 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may 2013 

goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount examples of such events or circumstances include 

 

       

  in accordance with asu 201108 zebra’s qualitative analysis determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our goodwill is less than the carrying amount and therefore performing the twostep impairment test was not necessary if zebra concluded otherwise we would perform the first step of the twostep impairment test by calculating the fair value and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeded the fair value we would perform the second step of goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

there have not been any significant changes to our impairment testing methodology other than updating the assumptions to reflect the current market environment zebra will monitor future results and will perform a test if indicators trigger an impairment review 

valuation of longlived and other intangible assets 

zebra evaluates the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

     if zebra believes that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets zebra measures impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 

net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 334356000 as of december 31 2013 

income taxes 

on january 1 2007 we adopted asc 740 according to asc 740 zebra identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions 

zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense 

we are currently undergoing an audit of the 2011 and 2012 us federal income tax returns the tax years 2009 through 2012 remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions tax authorities in the united kingdom have completed income tax audits for tax years through 2011 

included in deferred tax assets are amounts related to federal and state net operating losses that resulted from zebra’s acquisition of wherenet corp as of december 31 2013 zebra had approximately 8252000 of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in 2022 through 2027 as of december 31 2013 zebra had approximately 26980000 of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in 2013 through 2020 zebra’s intention is to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax expense under the united states tax reform act of 1986 the amount of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances including significant changes in ownership interests 

 

   

during 2012 in order to streamline the management financing and capital structure of its foreign affiliates zebra established a foreign holding company and restructured the ownership structure of its foreign affiliates this new holding company structure allows zebra to consolidate the ownership of its significant foreign affiliates under a single holding company in addition the structure introduced leverage which gives zebra the ability to facilitate cash pooling and improve the capital structure of its nonus operations the new capital structure and global financing favorably impacts the zebra’s effective tax rate and facilitates the tax efficient movement of zebra’s foreign cash to finance the ongoing operating and investment needs of the foreign subsidiaries the restructuring was completed in the second quarter of 2012 and was in place for the full year in 2013 

contingencies 

zebra records estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly zebra assesses the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

for further information regarding material pending legal proceedings see note 12 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k 

equitybased compensation 

as of december 31 2013 zebra had an active equitybased compensation plan and a stock purchase plan available for future grants we accounted for these plans in accordance with asc 505 and asc 718 zebra recognizes compensation costs using the straightline method over the vesting period of up to 5 years see notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k for further information 

liquidity and capital resources 

amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 average cash and marketable securities balances for 2013 increased compared to 2012 as a result of increased cash provided by operations partially offset by the acquisition of laserband and hart as well as stock repurchases 

as of december 31 2013 zebra had 415795000 in cash restricted cash investments and marketable securities compared with 394075000 at december 31 2012 factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2013 include the following changes below include the impact of foreign currency 

 

     management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements 

zebra earns a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions zebra does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds however should zebra require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally zebra could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense included in zebra’s cash restricted cash investments and marketable securities are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries zebra had 251658000 as of december 31 2013 and 173483000 as of december 31 2012 of foreign cash and investments which are primarily invested in us dollardenominated holdings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy’s objective is to achieve stable and predictable targeted rates of return and to provide the liquidity necessary for the operation of the business 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers specified investment liquidity levels and broad diversification across investments and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the fullyear impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under asc 320 formerly sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in over 100 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

 equity price risk 

zebra’s investment manager uses an investment strategy that is principally designed to preserve capital zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework as released in 1992 original framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2013 our internal control over financial reporting is effective management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 excludes the internal control over financial reporting related to hart systems acquired on december 18 2013 hart is included in the 2013 consolidated financial statements and constituted 91 and 100 of total net assets respectively as of december 31 2013 and 003 and 011 of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 43 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in january 2008 zebra began a program to update substantially all of its key financial systems as pieces of these systems are completed they will be subject to the requirements related to internal control over financial reporting the requirements for internal control over financial reporting will be a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems 

as of january 31 2011 we completed the implementation of the new systems for our emea region this implementation included customer order entry and invoicing inventory procurement and management certain accounts payable activity and other related operational systems as part of the implementation we changed many of the related internal controls primarily by replacing manual controls with system controls and streamlining zebra’s internal operations these new controls were subject to testing throughout 2011 2012 and 2013 

as of february 27 2012 we completed the implementation of the new systems for our north america region this implementation included customer order entry and invoicing inventory procurement and management certain accounts payable activity and other related operational systems as part of the implementation we changed many of the related internal controls substantially by reducing the number of manual controls with system controls and streamlining zebra’s internal operations these new controls were subject to testing throughout 2012 and 2013 

  

during 2012 we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls none of these changes has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting in addition there were no other changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been prevented or detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

zebra’s technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to help identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines incorporate thermal printing technology either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

  

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this form of thermal printing technology benefits applications requiring simple and reliable operations such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this form of thermal printing technology allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications such as circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels that require resistance to chemicals temperature extremes abrasion or labels requiring a long shelf life most of our printers in our high performance midrange print engine desktop and mobile categories use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation card printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye that is absorbed into a plastic card retransfer film or treated paper this process creates fullcolor photographic quality images that are wellsuited for driver’s licenses access and identification cards transaction cards ondemand photographs and financial cards credit debit and atm cards 

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speeds making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable barcodes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband 

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and firmware enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure the durability of our printers special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift firmware supports serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211abgn wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as zebra programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml these features make our printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts for media and consumables we sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow us to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries we experience a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region and industry served 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in specific industries we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete and more effectively offer our solutions to a greater number of end users 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when the customer is in a targeted highgrowth industry with applications for zebra solutions that span our product categories zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our channel partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a team that manages three global alliances they direct the business development strategies for thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

  

marketing marketing operations encompass global corporate marketing field marketing product marketing industry marketing market research and channel marketing functions corporate marketing manages our zebra brand globally corporate public relations internal communications and our web site corporate marketing is also responsible for market research and planning and industry marketing product marketing focuses on market analysis positioning product launch support and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses field marketing encompasses demand generation channel program management and marketing and sales enablement 

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship 

in 2010 we completed the transfer of final printer assembly to a thirdparty manufacturer jabil circuit inc this action reduces product costs and optimized our global printer product supply chain it has enabled us to be more responsive to customer needs and increase zebra’s flexibility to meet emerging business opportunities 

jabil produces our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order we maintain control over portions of the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of key component parts jabil is responsible for the procurement of the component parts and subassemblies used in the zebra printers it produces zebra has a subsidiary located in guangzhou china and has an office located near the jabil facility in china where our products are assembled this office is staffed with our sourcing engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal raw material pricing manufacturing process controls are maintained and the final printers meet our quality standards the majority of our printers manufactured by jabil are shipped to our regional distribution centers a small percentage of products are reconfigured at zebra’s distribution centers through firmware downloads packaging and customer specific customization before they are shipped to customers in addition certain products are manufactured in accordance with federal procurement regulations and various international trade agreements and remain eligible for sale to the united states government 

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of barcode label printers rfid printerencoders card personalization and active rfidreal time locating system rtls solutions 

we consider our direct competition in barcode label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems printerencoders mobile printers and supplies we also compete with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as inkjet and laser printing many of these companies are substantially larger than zebra 

dye sublimation the technology used in our card printers is only one of several commercially available processes used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than us in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

we compete with a diverse group of small companies marketing rtls solutions 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition in our printing business from many printer companies including the following listed in alphabetical order argox avery dennison bixolon blue bamboo boca systems brother international canon cim citizen cognitive tpg custom danaher datacard datamaxo’neil a unit of dover corporation dymo a newell rubbermaid company epson evolis fargo electronics a unit of hid global godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec inc lexmark international magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs technologies nisca oki data olympus practical automation printronix sato seiko instruments song woo electronics sony star micronics taiwan semiconductor toshiba tec victor data systems woosim and xerox 

  

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

zebra’s competitors in the location solutions products include aeroscout ekahau and ubisense 

alternative printing technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the preferred label card and receipt printer technology in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as complementary technologies to barcoded printing offering growth opportunities for zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

if other technologies were to evolve or become available it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors our products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of barcode printing and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge 

customers 

zebra has sold more than 11900000 thermal printers to customers as of december 31 2012 zebra had three customers that accounted for 10 or more of its sales all three of these customers are distributors and not end users our net sales to significant customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

sales 

net sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

   

net sales to international customers as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

 

 we believe that international sales are likely to increase faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america and western europe and generally higher economic growth rates in developing countries as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 30 different countries 

research and development 

zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our products maintain high levels of reliability and value to our customers

 item 1a risk factors tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

final assembly of our thermal printers and our location solutions products is performed by jabil circuit a thirdparty electronics manufacturer we are dependent on jabil as a sole source of supply for the manufacture of such products a failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results because we rely on a thirdparty provider such as jabil to manufacture our products zebra may incur increased business continuity risks zebra is no longer able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of its thermal printers and location solution products if jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers and location solution products until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers 

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components including final products from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks zebra has significant operations outside the united states which present added risks in addition zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales zebra also expects to continue the use of thirdparty contract manufacturing services with overseas production and assembly of our products 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

           customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 

zebra monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns zebra however cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

  

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

     future success will depend on zebra’s ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its products and solutions some competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to effectively provide and economically 

 

    zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products which may create additional pressures on zebra’s competitive position in the marketplace 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

        zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks 

 

        

future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect our financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trademarks trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of zebra’s intellectual property and its products or without authorization to misappropriate and use information which zebra regards as its trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

zebra’s products are subject to us and nonus foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

zebra is implementing a new companywide enterprise resource planning erp system the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will enhance a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters the system implementation has progressed well with emea implemented in january 2011 and north america in february 2012 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that often continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

until the new erp system is fully implemented zebra expects to incur additional selling general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures to implement and test the system and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified zebra’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets the possibility of further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business as widely reported financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption since 2008 including historically high volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations a recurrence of these developments and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and collections 

a natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations as widely reported a powerful earthquake centered off the northeastern coast of japan on march 11 2011 resulted in the loss of many lives widespread damage to and destruction of property disruption of electric power and the release of radiation from a crippled nuclear power plant this devastation disrupted the operations to varying degrees of companies with business activity in the affected region including the business of zebra suppliers other natural disasters may occur in the future and zebra is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business and results of operations

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

      

maintenance and support agreements 

we enter into postcontract maintenance and support agreements revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2012 consisted of the following 

 

  

 trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized 

zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale except for securities held in zebra’s deferred compensation plan which are considered to be trading securities investments in marketable debt securities are classified based on intent and ability to sell investment securities zebra’s availableforsale securities are used to fund further acquisitions and other operating needs and therefore can be sold prior to maturity investments in marketable debt securities for which zebra intends to sell within the next year are classified as current and those that we intend to hold in excess of oneyear are classified as noncurrent 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

      we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 04 to 12 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2012 were 669000 or 04 of the balance due we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2012 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

  

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 80 to 119 of gross inventory as of december 31 2012 inventory reserves were 13655000 or 100 of gross inventory we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2012 

valuation of goodwill 

goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount examples of such events or circumstances include 

 

       if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we perform an impairment test the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods income approach – discounted cash flow analysis market approach – guideline public company method and market approach – comparative transactions method the approach defined below is based upon our last impairment test conducted in june 2012 as of the end of may 2012 zebra did perform an interim impairment test in october 2012 for its smaller reporting unit as of the end of september 2012 the october 2012 test only utilized the income approach as discussed below 

under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” the key assumptions consider sales cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year 2021 these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions the fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current riskfree rates of capital current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment the company’s risk factors are discussed under item 1a of this form 10k 

under the “market approach – guideline company method” we identified 20 publicly traded companies including zebra which we believe have significant relevant similarities for these 20 companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda similar to the income approach discussed above sales cost of sales operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized the market prices of zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions if these market prices increase the estimated market value would increase if the market prices decrease the estimated market value would decrease 

under the “market approach – comparative transactions method” we looked at 19 market based transactions for companies that have similarities to our business segment including similarities to one or more of the business lines markets growth prospects margins and size we calculated mean revenue and ebitda multiples for the selected transactions these multiples were applied to forecasted zebra results for that segment to estimate market value the key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” and the “market approach – guideline company method” 

the results of these three methods are weighted based upon managements’ determination with more weight attached to the income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance the market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated 

  

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

there have not been any significant changes to our impairment testing methodology other than updating the assumptions to reflect the current market environment as discussed above key assumptions used in the first step of the goodwill impairment test were determined by management utilizing the internal operating plan the key assumptions utilized include forecasted growth rates for revenues and operating expenses as well as a discount rate which is determined by looking at current riskfree rates of capital current market interest rates and the evaluation of a risk premium relevant to the business segment zebra will monitor future results and will perform a test if indicators trigger an impairment review 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year as of the end of may or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable zebra has two reporting units required for its annual goodwill impairment test we completed our annual assessment during june 2012 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may 2012as part of zebra’s annual impairment test in the second quarter management determined that the larger of the two reporting units’ fair value exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount the second smaller reporting unit’s amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value ranged from approximately 8 under the income approach to 31 under the market approach 

due to the deterioration in the smaller reporting unit’s operating results during the third quarter failing to meet our forecasted revenues and operating expenses and a decline in expected growth rates our fair value calculation for the smaller reporting unit changed and we determined our goodwill associated with the smaller reporting unit was impaired the above impairment indicators led us to conclude an interim goodwill test was necessary zebra performed the first step of the impairment test which failed as a result zebra also performed a second step analysis and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 9114000 as of september 29 2012 after this impairment charge there is no remaining goodwill in the smaller reporting unit 

valuation of longlived and other intangible assets 

zebra evaluates the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

     if zebra believes that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets zebra measures impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 

net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 235442000 as of december 31 2012 

income taxes 

on january 1 2007 we adopted asc 740 according to asc 740 zebra identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions during 2008 zebra recognized an increase of approximately 4000000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition during 2012 zebra recognized an increase of 680000 for tax benefits related to the foreign restructuring 

  

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands 

 

 zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense 

an audit of us federal income tax returns for years of 2008 through 2010 was completed in 2012 the tax years 2008 through 2010 remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions tax authorities in the united kingdom have completed income tax audits for tax years through 2008 

included in deferred tax assets are amounts related to federal and state net operating losses that resulted from zebra’s acquisition of wherenet corp as of december 31 2012 zebra had approximately 2518000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in 2022 through 2027 as of december 31 2012 zebra also had approximately 27391000 of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in 2012 through 2020 zebra’s intention is to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax expense under the united states tax reform act of 1986 the amount of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances including significant changes in ownership interests 

 

 during 2012 zebra established a foreign holding company structure that is designed to accomplish various international business objectives this new holding company structure allows zebra to consolidate the ownership of its significant foreign affiliates under a single holding company in addition the structure gives the company the ability to facilitate cash pooling for its nonus operations and provide for the tax efficient movement of cash within the structure to efficiently deploy cash generated by the foreign subsidiaries zebra’s international income taxes have also decreased as result of this project 

contingencies 

zebra records estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly zebra assesses the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

for further information regarding material pending legal proceedings see note 12 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k 

equitybased compensation 

as of december 31 2012 zebra had an active equitybased compensation plan and a stock purchase plan available for future grants we accounted for these plans in accordance with asc 505 and asc 718 zebra recognizes compensation costs using the straightline method over the vesting period of up to 5 years see notes 2 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k for further information 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 average cash and marketable securities balances for 2012 increased compared to 2011 as a result of increased cash provided by operations 

as of december 31 2012 zebra had 394075000 in cash restricted cash investments and marketable securities compared with 326695000 at december 31 2011 factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2012 include the following changes below include the impact of foreign currency 

 

        management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 

zebra earns a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions zebra does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds however should zebra require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally zebra could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense included in zebra’s cash restricted cash investments and marketable securities are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries zebra had 173483000 as of december 31 2012 and 96829000 as of december 31 2011 of foreign cash and investments which are generally invested in us dollardenominated holdings 

contractual obligations

 purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials and finished goods 

on october 10 2012 zebra entered into a revolving credit agreement for a fiveyear 250 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by j p morgan securities llc as administrative agent the funds under this credit facility are available for general corporate purposes of zebra and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and other 

  

purposes permitted by the agreement as of december 31 2012 we had established letters of credit amounting to 2300000 which reduce the funds available for borrowing under the agreement no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2012 

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy’s objective is to achieve stable and predictable targeted rates of return and to provide the liquidity necessary for the operation of the business 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers specified investment liquidity levels and broad diversification across investments and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the fullyear impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under asc 320 formerly sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in over 100 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

 equity price risk 

zebra’s investment manager uses an investment strategy that is principally designed to preserve capital zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2012 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 43 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in january 2008 zebra began a program to update substantially all of its key financial systems as pieces of these systems are completed they will be subject to the requirements related to internal control over financial reporting the requirements for internal control over financial reporting will be a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems 

as of january 31 2011 we completed the implementation of the new systems for our emea region this implementation included customer order entry and invoicing inventory procurement and management certain accounts payable activity and other related operational systems as part of the implementation we changed many of the related internal controls primarily by replacing manual controls with system controls and streamlining zebra’s internal operations these new controls were subject to testing throughout 2011and 2012 

as of february 27 2012 we completed the implementation of the new systems for our north america region this implementation included customer order entry and invoicing inventory procurement and management certain accounts payable activity and other related operational systems as part of the implementation we changed many of the related internal controls substantially by reducing the number of manual controls with system controls and streamlining zebra’s internal operations these new controls were subject to testing throughout 2012 

  

during 2012 we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls none of these changes has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting in addition there were no other changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been prevented or detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

zebra’s technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to help identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines incorporate thermal printing technology either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this form of thermal printing technology benefits applications requiring simple and reliable operations such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this form of thermal printing technology allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications such as circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels that require resistance to chemicals temperature extremes abrasion or labels requiring a long shelf life most of our printers in our high performance midrange print engine desktop and mobile categories use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation card printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye that is absorbed into a plastic card retransfer film or treated paper this process creates fullcolor photographic quality images that are wellsuited for driver’s licenses access and identification cards transaction cards ondemand photographs and financial cards credit debit and atm cards 

  

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speeds making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable bar codes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband 

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and firmware enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure the durability of our printers special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift firmware supports serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211bg wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as zebra programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml these features make our printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux msdos ®  or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts for media and consumables we sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region and industry served 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in specific industries we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete and more effectively offer our solutions to a greater number of end users 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when the customer is in a targeted high growth industry with applications for zebra solutions that span our product categories zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a team that manages four global alliances they direct the business development strategies for thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

marketing marketing operations encompass global corporate marketing field marketing product marketing industry marketing market research and channel marketing functions corporate marketing manages our zebra brand globally corporate public relations internal communications and our web site the group is also responsible for market research and planning and industry marketing product marketing focuses on market analysis positioning product launch support and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses field marketing encompasses demand generation channel program management and marketing and sales enablement 

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship 

in 2010 we completed the transfer of final printer assembly to a thirdparty manufacturer jabil circuit inc this action has helped to reduce costs and optimize our global printer product supply chain and enabled us to be more responsive to 

  

customer needs and increase zebra’s flexibility to meet emerging business opportunities see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the transfer and transition process 

jabil produces our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order we maintain control over portions of the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of key component parts jabil is responsible for the procurement of the component parts and subassemblies used in the zebra printers it produces zebra has a subsidiary located in guangzhou china and has an office located near the jabil facility in china where our products are assembled this office is staffed with zebra sourcing engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal pricing on raw materials and the final printers meet our quality standards the majority of zebra printers manufactured by jabil are shipped to zebra’s regional distribution centers a small percentage of products are reconfigured at zebra’s distribution centers through firmware downloads packaging and some other customization before they are shipped to customers in addition certain products are manufactured in accordance with federal procurement regulations and various international trade agreements and remain eligible for sale to the united states government 

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers rfid printerencoder card personalization solutions and active rfidreal time locating system rtls solutions 

we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems printerencoders mobile printers and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as inkjet and laser printing many of these companies are substantially larger than zebra 

dye sublimation the technology used in our card printers is only one of several commercially available types of processes used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

we compete with a diverse group of companies marketing rtls solutions 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition from many companies including the following listed in alphabetical order aeroscout argox avery dennison boca systems brother international canon cim citizen cognitive tpg custom danaher datacard datamaxo’neil a unit of dover corporation dymo a newell rubbermaid company ekahau epson evolis fargo electronics a unit of hid global godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec inc lexmark international magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs technologies nisca oki data olympus practical automation printronix sato seiko instruments song woo electronics sony star micronics taiwan semiconductor toshiba tec ubisense victor data systems woosim and xerox 

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

zebra’s competitors in the location solutions space include aeroscout ekahau and ubisense 

alternative printing technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the preferred label card and receipt printer technology in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as 

  

complementary technologies to bar coded printing offering growth opportunities to zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printing and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support their standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge 

customers 

zebra has sold more than 10600000 thermal printers to customers as of december 31 2011 our net sales to significant customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

sales 

net sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

 net sales to international customers as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

 

 we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to increase faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america and western europe and generally higher economic growth rates in developing countries as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 30 different countries 

  

research and development 

zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our products maintain high levels of reliability and value to our customers 

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect many domestic and international trademarks we hold 394 united states and foreign patents and have 176 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 6 months to 23 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success

 item 1a risk factors tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

final assembly of our thermal printers is performed by jabil circuit a thirdparty electronics manufacturer we are dependent on jabil for the manufacture of such printers a failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results because we rely on a thirdparty provider such as jabil to manufacture its products zebra may incur increased business continuity risks 

zebra is no longer able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of its thermal printers jabil produces if jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with our existing customers 

a thirdparty provider such as jabil will have access to zebra’s intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks zebra has significant operations outside the united states which present added risks in addition zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

           customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery zebra monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns zebra however cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

  

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

     future success will depend on zebra’s ability to cost effectively adapt in this evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its products and solutions some competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to cost effectively provide 

 

    zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the rapid increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

       zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks 

 

        

future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect our financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

zebra’s products are subject to us and nonus foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

zebra is implementing a new companywide enterprise resource planning erp system the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will enhance a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that often continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows 

  

which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

until the new erp system is fully implemented zebra expects to incur additional selling general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures to implement and test the system and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified zebra’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets the possibility of further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business as widely reported financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption since 2008 including historically high volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations a recurrence of these developments and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and collections 

a natural disaster like the recent natural disasters in japan and thailand may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations as widely reported a powerful earthquake centered off the northeastern coast of japan on march 11 2011 resulted in the loss of many lives widespread damage to and destruction of property disruption of electric power and the release of radiation from a crippled nuclear power plant this devastation disrupted the operations to varying degrees of companies with business activity in the affected region including the business of zebra suppliers other natural disasters may occur in the future and zebra is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such or similarof these disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations the consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business and results of operations

consolidated results of operations 

amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 consolidated results of operations – fourth quarter 

sales 

net sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the 2010 quarter increased 57 primarily due to a broadbased increase in demand new product introductions and expansion of gotomarket channels new products introduced over the past year helped us meet more of our customers’ needs for improving asset visibility in complex supply chain markets the increase in sales was largely attributable to 52 growth in hardware sales with notable increases in desktop mobile card printers and aftermarket parts printer unit volume increased 129 from the fourth quarter of 2010 

sales by product category were as follows amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

   

sales increased in all international geographic regions in part from the impact of our investments in sales and salesrelated personnel to expand zebra’s presence in highgrowth regions including china brazil and eastern europe sales in the regions targeted by zebra for geographic expansion increased by 11 in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 zebra continues to build a broader base of customers to penetrate targeted industries more deeply movements in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 420000 in the europe middle east and africa regions for the quarter due principally to a weaker euro against the us dollar from the prior year 

sales to customers by geographic region were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 gross profit 

gross profit increased 63 from lower costs for raw materials and higher volumes gross profit was affected by unfavorable foreign currency movements which decreased fourth quarter gross profit by 330000 as a percentage of sales gross margin improved from 489 to 491 

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

 

 for the fourth quarter of 2011 unit volumes increased in nearly all printer product lines compared to the same period of 2010 with notable volume increases in card desktop and mobile printers the decrease in average selling price is a result primarily of a change in product mix from one quarter compared to another 

operating expenses 

operating expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

 

 operating expenses for the quarter increased 113 due mainly to greater selling and marketing expenses and research and development expenses several categories accounted for these increases including compensation costs related to higher head count which includes salaries benefits bonuses and commissions business development outside professional services a 2011 global partners conference project expenses and travel and entertainment expenses all increased over 2010 levels litigation settlement relates to escrowed purchase funds received in 2010 

  

other income expense 

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 other expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily as a result of increases in miscellaneous expenses as zebra expands its international presence 

operating income 

operating income for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 is consistent see comments above for explanation of changes in individual categories

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment except in asia where the terms are fob destination provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with 

  

historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

    maintenance and support agreements 

we enter into postcontract maintenance and support agreements revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2011 consisted of the following 

 

  

 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldto 

  

maturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized as of december 31 2011 zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale in addition as of december 31 2011 all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm investments on the balance sheet due to our ability and intent to hold them until maturity 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

      we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 09 to 15 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2011 were 1560000 or 10 of the balance due we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2011 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 80 to 114 of gross inventory as of december 31 2011 inventory reserves were 14710000 or 99 of gross inventory we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2011 

valuation of goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our annual assessment during june 2011 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may 2011 

during the first quarter of 2011 we announced an agreement to sell navis and our decision to divest certain other operations these operations constituted a portion of our zebra enterprise solutions zes segment which was also deemed to be the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes as a result of our decision to sell navis goodwill attributable to the zes segment was allocated to the three businesses that constituted the prior reporting unit based on the relative fair value of those businesses goodwill was allocated between continuing operations 9114000 and discontinued operations 72795000 based on the relative fair value of each of the businesses 

the goodwill allocated above to continuing operations was tested for impairment and we determined that our goodwill related to this reporting unit was not impaired 

beginning with the first quarter of 2011 the continuing operations of the former zes reporting unit have been combined with the former specialty printing group “spg” operating segment to form one zebra operating segment 

  

goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount examples of such events or circumstances include 

 

        if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we perform an impairment test the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods income approach – discounted cash flow analysis market approach – guideline public company method and market approach – comparative transactions method the approach defined below is based upon our last impairment test conducted in june 2011 as of the end of may 2011 

under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” the key assumptions consider sales cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year 2018 these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions the fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current riskfree rates of capital current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment the company’s risk factors are discussed under item 1a of this form 10k 

under the “market approach – guideline company method” we identified five publicly traded companies including zebra which we believe have significant relevant similarities for these five companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda similar to the income approach discussed above sales cost of sales operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized the market prices of zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions if these market prices increase the estimated market value would increase if the market prices decrease the estimated market value would decrease 

under the “market approach – comparative transactions method” we looked at eight market based transactions for companies that have similarities to our business segment including similarities to one or more of the business lines markets growth prospects margins and size we calculated mean revenue and ebitda multiples for the selected transactions these multiples were applied to forecasted zebra results for that segment to estimate market value the key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” and the “market approach – guideline company method” 

the results of these three methods are weighted based upon managements’ determination with more weight attached to the income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance the market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

  

valuation of longlived and other intangible assets 

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

     if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 

net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 190192000 as of december 31 2011 

income taxes 

on january 1 2007 we adopted asc 740 according to asc 740 we identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions during 2008 we recognized an increase of approximately 4000000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands 

 

 zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense 

zebra is currently under us federal income tax audits for years of 2008 and 2009 the tax years 2006 through 2010 remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions tax authorities in the united kingdom have completed income tax audits for tax years through 2006 

included in deferred tax assets are amounts related to federal and state net operating losses that resulted from our acquisition of wherenet corp as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 21932000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in 2022 through 2027 as of december 31 2010 we also had approximately 27134000 of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in 2012 through 2020 zebra’s intention is to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax expense under the united states tax reform act of 1986 the amounts of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances including significant changes in ownership interests in addition as of december 31 2010 zebra had approximately 8832000 of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which currently can be carried forward indefinitely 

 

   

zebra’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 included a 2764000 reduction of federal taxes related to improperly accounting for the tax impact on intercompany profit generated from intercompany sales in 2009 this adjustment reduced our effective rate for 2010 by approximately 18 zebra’s effective tax rate decreased in 2011 due primarily to higher profits in lower rate international jurisdictions 

contingencies 

we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate

           management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 

zebra earns a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions zebra does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds however should zebra require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally zebra could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense included in zebra’s cash restricted cash investments and marketable 

  

securities are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries zebra had 96829000 as of december 31 2011 and 42367000 as of december 31 2010 of foreign cash and investments which are generally invested in us dollardenominated holdings

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued update 200913 asc 605 revenue recognition multiple –deliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to existing multiple element arrangement guidance the first relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting this change is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement ultimately leading to less revenue deferral the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables these changes are likely to result in earlier recognition of revenue for multipleelement arrangements than under previous guidance this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 this standard did not have a material effect upon our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2010 the fasb issued update 201028 asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other when to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force this updated guidance requires entities with reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts to perform and additional test to determine if goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of impairment step 2 this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 this standard will not have a material effect upon our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy’s objective is to achieve stable and predictable targeted rates of return and to provide the liquidity necessary for the operation of the business 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers specified investment liquidity levels and broad diversification across investments and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the full year impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under asc 320 formerly sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested

we conduct business in over 100 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 11 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

   

equity price risk 

zebra’s investment manager uses an investment strategy that is principally designed to preserve capital zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments at the end of 2011 and 2010 zebra held no direct equity positions

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2011 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 44 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in january 2008 zebra began a program to update substantially all of its key financial systems as pieces of these systems are completed they will be subject to the requirements related to internal control over financial reporting the requirements for internal control over financial reporting will be a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems 

as of january 31 2011 we completed the implementation of the new systems for our emea region this implementation included customer order entry and invoicing inventory procurement and management certain accounts payable activity and other related operational systems as part of the implementation we changed many of the related internal controls primarily by replacing manual controls with system controls and streamlining zebra’s internal operations these new controls were subject to testing throughout 2011 

during 2011 we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls none of these changes has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting in addition there were no other changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been prevented or detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

zebra specialty printing group spg 

we design our printer products to operate at the point of issuance to produce highquality labels tickets receipts and plastic cards on demand the exceptional diversity of applications using our printer products for barcoding and personal identification includes routing and tracking patient safety transaction processing and identification and authentication these applications require high levels of data accuracy where speed reliability and durability are critical they also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets where improved customer service and productivity gains may be the primary reason for using our on demand receipt printers plastic cards are used for secure reliable personal identification access control and financial cards credit debit and atm cards by financial institutions 

applications for our printing technology span most industries and geographies they include inventory control small package delivery baggage handling automated warehousing jit justintime manufacturing employee time and attendance records file management systems patient barcode wrist banding medical specimen labeling shop floor control instore product labeling employee id cards driver’s licenses and access control systems as of december 31 2010 management estimates that zebra has sold more than 9400000 printers to customers around the world 

we believe competitive forces on businesses worldwide to strengthen security reduce costs more effectively manage assets improve quality deliver better customer service and increase productivity support the adoption of the printing and automatic identification applications that zebra provides because these solutions deliver significant and predictable economic benefits industrymandated compliance requirements for bar code labeling and rfid tagging are also important catalysts in the deployment of these systems many of zebra’s applications enhance the use of enterprise resource planning erp and other process improvement systems in manufacturing and service organizations greater emphasis on supply chain management the drive to reduce errors in healthcare and heightened concern over safety and security are also increasing the use of automatic identification systems still other applications are taking advantage of recent advances in wireless and handheld computing technologies 

concern for safety and security and personal identification contribute to demand for our card printer products this concern has heightened interest in systems that provide personal identification and access control including secure id systems for driver’s licenses employee and visitor badges national identification cards event passes club membership cards and keyless entry systems financial institutions utilize card printers for credit debit and atm cards 

  

our printers are used to print bar code labels receipts plastic identification cards wristbands and tags and to encode passive rfid “smart” labels and cards we also sell related specialty labeling materials thermal ink ribbons and bar code label design and network management software these products are used to support bar code labeling personal identification and specialty printing solutions principally in the manufacturing supply chain retail healthcare and government sectors of the economy we work closely with distributors valueadded resellers kiosk manufacturers and end users of our products to design and implement printing solutions that meet their technical demands to achieve this flexibility we provide our customers with a broad selection of printer models each of which can be configured for a specific application additionally we will select and if necessary create appropriate labeling stock ink ribbons and adhesives to suit a particular application inhouse engineering personnel in software mechanical electronic and chemical engineering participate in the creation and development of printing solutions for particular applications 

we produce the industry’s broadest range of rugged ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal printers our printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs we believe this breadth of product offering is a unique and significant competitive strength because it allows zebra to satisfy the widest variety of thermal printing applications and leverage our brand and reputation as customers install new systems that require on demand printing 

of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most bar code labeling and other ondemand printing applications thermal transfer printing produces durable dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where ease of use smaller size and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s mobile and desktop units 

as of december 31 2010 we offered 54 thermal printer models with numerous variations in eight categories as follows 

 

        in addition to their use in ondemand automatic identification applications our thermal printers can also be used for onsite batch production of custom bar code labels and other graphics this capability results in shorter lead times reduced inventory and more flexibility than can be provided with traditional offsite printing 

printer supplies 

supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels wristbands plastic cards card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons zebra promotes the use of genuine zebra brand supplies with its printing equipment 

zebra fully supports its printers resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality highperformance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs supplies are chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform these printing solutions frequently include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed to optimize image resolution and printer performance while meeting the most demanding end user application performance criteria factors such as adhesion resistance to scratches smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials the use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade image quality and decrease the part life of key printer components such as printheads

printer warranties 

in general zebra provides warranty coverage of one year on printers against defects in material and workmanship printheads are warranted for nine months and batteries are warranted for twelve months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair or replacement during the applicable warranty periods 

zebra’s printer technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to help identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines incorporate thermal printing technology either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this form of thermal printing technology benefits applications requiring simple and reliable operations such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this form of thermal printing technology allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications such as circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels that require resistance to chemicals temperature extremes abrasion or labels requiring a long shelf life most of our printers in our high performance midrange print engine desktop and mobile categories use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation card printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye that is absorbed into a plastic card retransfer film or treated paper this process creates fullcolor photographic quality images that are wellsuited for driver’s licenses access and identification cards transaction cards ondemand photographs and financial cards credit debit and atm cards 

  

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speeds making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable bar codes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband 

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and firmware enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure the durability of our printers special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift firmware supports serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211bg wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as zebra programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml these features make our printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux msdos ®  or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts for media and consumables we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region and industry served 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in specific industries we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete and more effectively offer our solutions to a greater number of end users 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a group that manages a small number of global alliances they direct the business development strategies for a limited number of thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

marketing marketing operations encompass corporate marketing marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research and channel marketing functions corporate marketing conducts activities to enhance the zebra corporate brand corporate public relations internal corporate communications and our web site the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses 

  

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship 

in february 2008 we announced that final printer assembly would be transferred to a thirdparty manufacturer jabil circuit inc we completed the transition of transferring all printer lines to jabil in 2010 this action has helped to reduce costs and optimize our global printer product supply chain and enabled us to be more responsive to customer needs and increase zebra’s flexibility to meet emerging business opportunities see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the transfer and transition process 

jabil produces our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order we maintain control over the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of key component parts jabil is responsible for the procurement of the component parts and subassemblies used in the zebra printers it produces zebra has a subsidiary located in guangzhou china and has an office located near the jabil facility in china where our products are assembled this office is staffed with zebra sourcing engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal pricing on raw materials and the final printers meet our quality standards the majority of zebra printers manufactured by jabil are shipped to zebra’s regional distribution centers a small percentage of products are reconfigured at zebra’s distribution centers through firmware downloads packaging and some other customization before they are shipped to customers in addition certain products are manufactured in accordance with federal procurement regulations and various international trade agreements and remain eligible for sale to the united states government 

printer competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers rfid printerencoder and card personalization solutions 

we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems printerencoders mobile printers and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as inkjet and laser printing many of these companies are substantially larger than zebra 

dye sublimation the technology used in our card printers is only one of several commercially available types of processes used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition from many competitors including the following listed in alphabetical order argox avery dennison boca systems brother international canon cim citizen cognitive tpg custom danaher datacard datamaxo’neil a unit of dover corporation dymo a newell rubbermaid company epson evolis fargo electronics a unit of hid global godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec inc lexmark international magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs technologies nisca oki data olympus practical automation printronix sato seiko instruments song woo electronics sony star micronics taiwan semiconductor toshiba tec victor data systems woosim and xerox 

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

alternative printing technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the preferred label card and receipt printer technology in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as complementary technologies to bar coded printing offering growth opportunities to zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

  

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printing and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support their standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge

customers 

zebra has sold more than 9400000 thermal printers to customers as of december 31 2010 

scansource inc is our most significant customer our net sales to scansource a global distributor of zebra spg products as a percent of our total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

  

sales 

net sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

 net sales to international customers as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

 

 we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to increase faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america and western europe and generally higher economic growth rates in developing countries as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 30 different countries 

research and development 

zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our products maintain high levels of reliability research and development resources are also directed toward enhancing our zes systems

 item 1a risk factors tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

final assembly of our thermal printers is performed by jabil circuit a thirdparty electronics manufacturer we are now dependent on jabil for the manufacture of such printers a failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra now requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results because we rely on a thirdparty provider such as jabil to manufacture its products zebra may incur increased business continuity risks 

zebra is no longer able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of its thermal printers jabil produces if jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate in the event of supply disruption this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both short term and long term on relations with our existing customers 

a thirdparty provider such as jabil will have access to zebra’s intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks zebra has significant operations overseas which present added risks in addition zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

             

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

     future success will depend on zebra’s ability to cost effectively adapt in this evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery zebra monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns zebra however cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 

zebra may be a party to fixedprice contracts particularly for its zes product lines that could become unfavorable contracts from time to time we may enter into contracts to provide services to customers for fixed fees such a contract could result in material loss to zebra if the cost to perform such contract ultimately exceeds the fees earned on such contract 

zebra competes in a competitive industry which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its products and solutions some competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to cost effectively provide 

 

    zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the rapid increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth and acquisitions this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

       zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may 

  

present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks 

 

      future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect our financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

zebra’s products are subject to us and foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

  

zebra is implementing a new companywide enterprise resource planning erp system the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will enhance a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that often continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

until the new erp system is fully implemented zebra expects to incur additional selling general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures to implement and test the system and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified zebra’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets the possibility of further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions in the united states or internationally or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business as widely reported financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption in 2008 and 2009 including historically high volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations a recurrence of these developments and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound the chinese yuan and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and collections

gross profit in 2009 compared with 2008 decreased due to lower volumes and a less favorable product mix higher freight costs were incurred in order to meet customer demand in 2009 primarily in the fourth quarter unfavorable foreign exchange rates in 2009 decreased gross profit in 2009 by 16745000 net of hedges these factors were partially offset by the benefit of outsourcing and the full year effect of continued cost containment efforts in 2009 

operating expenses 

operating expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

 

 lower overall operating expenses for 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from decreases in several categories including payroll costs primarily from lower staffing levels outside commissions project costs and travel and entertainment expenses amortization of intangibles decreased due to impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the impairment of goodwill intellectual property and other assets expenses in 2008 were reduced by the receipt of an escrow claim litigation settlement received in the third quarter of 2008 the above reductions were partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses for consulting and benefit costs in 2009 

during the fourth quarter or 2008 we took charges totaling 157600000 for the impairment of goodwill intellectual property and other assets during the second quarter of 2009 1495000 of the goodwill impairment charge was reversed and a 437000 impairment charge was recorded related to an intangible asset in our zes segment

asset impairment charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that certain impairment indicators existed related to identified intangible assets and conducted an additional impairment test of intangibles due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we determined that our goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired requiring total estimated impairment charges of 157600000 at december 31 2008 upon completion of a detailed second step impairment analysis we recorded a credit of 1495000 in the second quarter of 2009 to adjust a portion of our original goodwill impairment in 2009 we also recorded an impairment charge for an intangible asset or 437000 see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of the asset impairment charges

 investment income for 2009 would have been 958000 higher due to writedowns recorded in 2009 related to losses on equity investments investment income for 2008 would have been 7271000 higher due to losses related to the writedown of an auction rate security of 4374000 and a long term equity investment in the amount of 2897000 in 2008 excluding these writedowns investment income for 2009 would have been 3891000 compared to 8552000 in 2008 excluding the 2008 writedowns zebra’s annualized rate of return would have been 34 for 2008 while the 2009 rate of return would have been 16 the investment income for 2008 was higher due to interest rates being higher in 2008 and zebra’s cash balances also being higher throughout 2008 cash and marketable securities balances for 2009 have decreased compared to 2008 as a result of payments for acquisitions and for the repurchase of zebra class a common stock 

operating income loss 

the increase in operating income for 2009 over 2008 is the result of cost containment efforts reduced exit restructuring and integration costs and the impairment charge recorded in 2008 the operating loss for 2008 is the result of the impairment charges which totaled 157600000 see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of the asset impairment charges also significantly contributing to the operating loss in 2008 were exit restructuring and integrations costs of 20009000 offset by the wherenet litigation settlement of 5302000 

income taxes

our international spg sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the us dollar british pound and euro this diversity causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates the stronger us dollar to the euro and the pound had a negative impact of approximately 21890000 net of hedges on sales during 2009 compared with 2008 we typically hedge a portion of anticipated eurodenominated sales to partially protect zebra against exchange rate movements for the year this program resulted in a gain on hedges of 603000 

gross profit margin for spg was affected by unfavorable foreign currency rate movements which decreased year to date gross profit versus 2008 gross profit by 16745000 net of hedges lower volume and a less favorable product mix reduced gross margins outsourcing of our manufacturing operations resulted in favorable improvement to gross margin in 2009 

lower overall operating expenses resulted from decreases in payroll costs business development costs recruiting and relocation costs outside commissions project costs travel and entertainment expenses and offsite meetings much of the decreased payroll and benefit costs were a result of lower staffing levels and cost reduction initiatives amortization of intangibles was reduced by 3010000 for 2009 as compared to 2008 due to asset writedowns taken in 2008

 zebra enterprise solutions – year to date 

zes sales decreased 140 for 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the severely challenging economic conditions of zes’ key markets namely maritime and automotive markets sales declined in hardware and services but remained steady in license fees and maintenance support margins improved in services provided to customers due to reduced service costs 

  

zes operating expenses are summarized below in thousands 

 

 zes operating expenses for 2009 were lower than the 2008 level due to lower staffing levels which were offset by increased benefit costs and contract employees other operating expenses reductions resulted from cost containment efforts collection of previously reserved accounts reduced outside service costs and lower amortization of intangibles due to asset writedowns in the fourth quarter of 2008 amortization of intangibles was reduced by 5099000 for 2009 as compared to 2008 included in operating expenses for 2008 is a 5302000 expense reduction related to a payment received from an escrow claim settlement related to our prior acquisition of wherenet see note 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the wherenet escrow claim net settlement and note 7 for further information related to the impairment charges 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment except in asia where the terms are fob destination provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

      

 maintenance and support agreements 

we enter into postcontract maintenance and support agreements revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2010 consisted of the following 

 

  

 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized as of december 31 2010 zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale in addition as of december 31 2010 all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm investments on the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 

see note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for the fair value discussion of auction rate security investment valuations 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

        

we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 13 to 30 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2010 were 2161000 or 14 of the balance due we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2010 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 68 to 110 of gross inventory as of december 31 2010 inventory reserves were 9837000 or 80 of gross inventory we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2010 

valuation of goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our annual assessment during june 2010 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may 2010 

goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount examples of such events or circumstances include 

 

        due to the deterioration of the economy in 2008 and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we performed an interim test of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2008 and determined that the goodwill associated with our zes segment was impaired see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we perform an impairment test the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods income approach – discounted cash flow analysis market approach – guideline public company method and market approach – comparative transactions method 

under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” the key assumptions consider sales cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year 2015 these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions the fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current riskfree rates of capital current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment the company’s risk factors are discussed under item 1a of this form 10k 

  

under the “market approach – guideline company method” we identified 12 publicly traded companies including zebra which we believe have significant relevant similarities for these 12 companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda similar to the income approach discussed above sales cost of sales operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized the market prices of zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions if these market prices increase the estimated market value would increase if the market prices decrease the estimated market value would decrease 

under the “market approach – comparative transactions method” we looked at 22 market based transactions for companies that have similarities to our business segment including similarities to one or more of the business lines markets growth prospects margins and size we calculated mean revenue and ebitda multiples for the selected transactions these multiples were applied to forecasted zebra results for that segment to estimate market value the key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” and the “market approach – guideline company method” 

the results of these three methods are weighted based upon managements’ determination with more weight attached to the income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance the market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we determined that our goodwill from our 2007 and 2008 zes acquisitions was impaired requiring total estimated goodwill impairment charges of 113679000 at december 31 2008 upon completion of a detailed second step impairment analysis we recorded a credit of 1495000 in the second quarter of 2009 to adjust a portion of the original estimated goodwill impairment for zes 

valuation of longlived and other intangible assets 

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

     if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that certain impairment indicators related to identified intangible assets existed and conducted an additional impairment test of intangibles due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we determined that our other intangible assets consisting of our 2007 and 2008 zes acquisitions and intellectual property were impaired requiring total estimated impairment charges of 43921000 at december 31 2008 the intangible asset impairment charges in our spg segment were related primarily to radio frequency identification patents and patent rights the intangible asset impairment charges in our zes segment were related to customer relationships technology third party technology licenses and noncompetition agreements we recorded an impairment charge to a zes intangible asset of 437000 in 2009 no impairment charges were recorded in 2010 

net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 290622000 as of december 31 2010 

income taxes 

on january 1 2007 we adopted asc 740 formerly fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  according to asc 740 we identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions during 2008 we recognized an increase of approximately 4000000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers specified investment liquidity levels and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the full year impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under asc 320 formerly sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in over 100 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 10 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

   

equity price risk 

zebra’s investment manager uses a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments however at the end of 2010 and 2009 zebra held no equity positions

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2010 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 56 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in january 2008 zebra began a program to update substantially all of its key financial systems as portions of these systems are completed they will be subject to the requirements related to internal control over financial reporting the requirements for internal control over financial reporting are a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems as of january 1 2010 we changed the functional currency of our uk subsidiary from the pound to the us dollar as a result we modified and enhanced our reconciliation and management review controls over this subsidiary the modified controls have been in effect since the conversion date during 2010 we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect and there were no other changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been prevented or detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

the company 

zebra delivers products and solutions that improve our customers’ ability to put their critical assets to work smarter by identifying tracking and managing assets transactions and people 

through the specialty printing group spg we design manufacture and sell specialty printing devices that print variable information on demand at the point of issuance these devices are used worldwide by manufacturers service and retail organizations and governments for automatic identification data collection and personal identification in applications that improve productivity deliver better customer service and provide more effective security our product range consists of direct thermal and thermal transfer label and receipt printers passive radio frequency identification rfid printerencoders and dye sublimation card printers we also sell a comprehensive range of specialty supplies consisting of selfadhesive labels thermal transfer ribbons thermal printheads batteries and other accessories including software for label design and printer network management 

in 2007 and 2008 we acquired wherenet corp proveo ag navis holdings llc and multispectral solutions inc these companies comprise the zebra enterprise solutions group zes the acquisitions of these companies has expanded the range of identification and tracking solutions we deliver to our customers in addition they provided us with new technologies to offer our customers including active rfid global positioning systems gps telematics and ultra wideband uwb technologies zes products consist of batterypowered wireless tags fixedposition antennae transponder modules and application software zes also provides consulting services maintenance contracts and software licenses 

  

zebra specialty printing group spg 

we design our printer products to operate at the point of issuance to produce highquality labels tickets receipts and plastic cards on demand the exceptional diversity of applications using our printer products for barcoding and personal identification includes routing and tracking transactions processing and identification and authentication these applications require high levels of data accuracy where speed reliability and durability are critical they also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets where improved customer service and productivity gains may be the primary reason for using our on demand receipt printers plastic cards are used for secure reliable personal identification or access control 

applications for our printing technology span most industries and geographies they include inventory control small package delivery baggage handling automated warehousing jit justintime manufacturing employee time and attendance records file management systems hospital information systems medical specimen labeling shop floor control instore product labeling employee id cards driver’s licenses and access control systems as of december 31 2009 management estimates that zebra has sold more than 8400000 printers to customers around the world 

we believe competitive forces on businesses worldwide to strengthen security reduce costs more effectively manage assets improve quality deliver better customer service and increase productivity support the adoption of the printing and automatic identification applications zebra provides because these solutions deliver significant and predictable economic benefits industrymandated compliance requirements for bar code labeling and rfid tagging are also important catalysts in the deployment of these systems many of zebra’s applications enhance the use of enterprise resource planning erp and other process improvement systems in manufacturing and service organizations greater emphasis on supply chain management the drive to reduce errors in healthcare and heightened concern over safety and security are also increasing the use of automatic identification systems still other applications are taking advantage of recent advances in wireless and handheld computing technologies 

concern for safety and security and personal identification contribute to demand for our card printer products this concern has heightened interest in systems that provide personal identification and access control including secure id systems for driver’s licenses employee and visitor badges national identification cards event passes club membership cards and keyless entry systems 

our printers are used to print bar code labels receipts plastic identification cards wristbands tags and encode passive rfid “smart” labels we also sell related specialty labeling materials thermal ink ribbons and bar code label design and network management software these products are used to support bar code labeling personal identification and specialty printing solutions principally in the manufacturing supply chain retail healthcare and government sectors of the economy we work closely with distributors valueadded resellers kiosk manufacturers and end users of our products to design and implement printing solutions that meet their technical demands to achieve this flexibility we provide our customers with a broad selection of printer models each of which can be configured for a specific application additionally we will select and if necessary create appropriate labeling stock ink ribbons and adhesives to suit a particular application inhouse engineering personnel in software mechanical electronic and chemical engineering participate in the creation and development of printing solutions for particular applications 

we produce the industry’s broadest range of rugged ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal printers our printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs we believe this breadth of product offering is a unique and significant competitive strength because it allows zebra to satisfy the widest variety of thermal printing applications and leverage our brand and reputation as customers install new systems that require on demand printing 

of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most bar code labeling and other ondemand printing applications thermal transfer printing produces durable dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where ease of use smaller size and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s mobile and desktop units 

  

as of december 31 2009 we offered 58 thermal printer models with numerous variations in eight categories as follows 

 

        in addition to their use in ondemand automatic identification applications our thermal printers can also be used for onsite batch production of custom bar code labels and other graphics this capability results in shorter lead times reduced inventory and more flexibility than can be provided with traditional offsite printing 

printer supplies 

supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels wristbands plastic cards card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons zebra promotes the use of genuine zebra brand supplies with its printing equipment 

zebra fully supports its printers resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality highperformance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs supplies are chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform these printing solutions frequently include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed to optimize image resolution and printer performance while meeting the most demanding end user application performance criteria factors such as adhesion resistance to scratches smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials the use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade image quality and decrease the part life of key printer components such as printheads 

printer related software 

zebra has specialized printer management label design and driver solutions to help unlock the full potential of zebra printers the zebralink solutions suite of networking software firmware offerings combined with the enhanced printer management capabilities of zebranet™ bridge makes zebra’s printers easy to use and integrate into small medium and enterprisewide environments our goal is to provide software that enables high levels of functionality to all major computer network and software systems network systems include ethernet 80211bg and bluetooth ®  in 2009 the zebralink multiplatform software development and smart phone utility was introduced to aid with printing from smartphones to zebra printers

printer warranties 

in general zebra provides warranty coverage of one year on printers against defects in material and workmanship printheads are warranted for nine months and batteries are warranted for twelve months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair or replacement during the applicable warranty periods 

zebra’s printer technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to help identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines incorporate thermal printing technology either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this form of thermal printing technology benefits applications requiring simple and reliable operations such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this form of thermal printing technology allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications such as circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels that require resistance to chemicals temperature extremes abrasion or labels requiring a long shelf life most of our printers in our high performance midrange print engine desktop and mobile categories use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation card printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye that is absorbed into a plastic card retransfer film or treated paper this process creates fullcolor photographic quality images that are wellsuited for driver’s licenses access and identification cards transaction cards and ondemand photographs 

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speeds making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable bar codes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband 

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and firmware enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure the durability of our printers special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift firmware supports serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211bg wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as zebra 

  

programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml these features make our printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux msdos ®  or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts for media and consumables we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region and industry served 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in specific industries we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete and more effectively offer our solutions to a greater number of end users 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a group that manages a small number of global alliances they direct the business development strategies for a limited number of thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

marketing marketing operations encompass corporate marketing marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research and channel marketing functions corporate marketing conducts activities to enhance the zebra corporate brand corporate public relations internal corporate communications and our web site the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses 

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship 

in february 2008 we announced that final printer assembly would be transferred to a thirdparty manufacturer jabil circuit inc we completed the transition of transferring substantially all printer lines to jabil in 2009 this action is helping to reduce costs and optimize our global printer product supply chain by improving responsiveness to customer needs and increasing zebra’s flexibility to meet emerging business opportunities see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the transfer and transition process 

  

jabil produces our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order we maintain control over the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of key component parts jabil is responsible for the procurement of the component parts and subassemblies used in the zebra printers it produces jabil owns the inventory associated with the product until the product is shipped to zebra zebra has a subsidiary located in guangzhou china and has an office located near the jabil facility in china where our products are assembled this office is staffed with zebra sourcing engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal pricing on raw materials and the final printers meet our quality standards zebra printers manufactured by jabil are shipped to zebra’s regional distribution centers the majority of the product passes through to zebra’s distribution centers a small percentage of products are reconfigured at zebra’s distribution centers through firmware downloads packaging and some other customization before they are shipped to customers in addition certain products are manufactured in accordance with federal procurement regulations and various international trade agreements and remain eligible for sale to the united states government 

printer competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers rfid printerencoder and card personalization solutions 

we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems printerencoders mobile printers and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as inkjet and laser printing many of these companies are substantially larger than zebra 

dye sublimation the technology used in our card printers is only one of several commercially available types of processes used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition from many competitors including the following listed in alphabetical order altech argox avery dennison boca systems brother international canon cim citizen cognitivetpg colorx copal custom danaher datacard datamaxo’neil a unit of dover corporation dymo a newell rubbermaid company epson evolis fargo electronics fuji godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec technologies lexmark international logickacomp magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs nisca oki data olmec olympus practical automation printronix sato seiko instruments shinko song woo electronics sony star micronics taiwan semiconductor toshibatec victor data systems woosim and xerox 

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

alternative printer technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the label card and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as complementary technologies to bar coded printing offering growth opportunities to zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

  

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printing and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support their standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge 

zebra enterprise solutions group zes 

formed in 2008 principally from the acquired businesses of navis holdings llc wherenet corp proveo ag and multispectral solutions inc zebra enterprise solutions group offers asset tracking and management solutions to optimize the flow of goods in complex logistical operations whether tracking containers and cargo through a major port managing parts for lean manufacturing or managing ground support equipment at a major airport the automated asset tracking and management solutions from zes improve business processes utilizing the combined products offered by these businesses zes provides greater asset visibility and business efficiency for the aerospace and defense aviation automotive industrial manufacturing maritime and transportation and logistics industries customers within these industries benefit by increasing productivity lowering operational costs and improving safety and security throughout their logistics operations

customers 

zebra has sold more than 8400000 thermal printers to customers as of december 31 2009 

scansource inc is our most significant customer our net sales to scansource a global distributor of zebra spg products as a percent of our total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

sales 

net sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

 the increase in service and software net sales in 2008 was primarily due to our zes acquisitions 

net sales to international customers as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

 

 we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to increase faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america and western europe and generally higher economic growth rates in developing countries as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 26 different countries 

research and development 

zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

   

we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our products maintain high levels of reliability research and development resources are also directed toward enhancing our zes systems the increase in research and development expenditures for zes in 2008 was mainly attributed to the acquisition of navis holdings llc late in 2007 

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect many domestic and international trademarks we hold 347 united states and foreign patents and have 151 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 1 to 23 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results cash flows and growth prospects 

zebra may be a party to fixedprice contracts particularly for its zes business unit that could become unfavorable contracts from time to time zes may enter into contracts to provide services to customers for fixed fees such a contract could result in material loss to zebra if the cost to perform such contract ultimately exceeds the fees earned on such contract 

zebra transferred final assembly of its thermal printers to jabil circuit and is now dependent on jabil for the manufacture of such printers a failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results to improve responsiveness to customer needs and achieve cost savings and operational benefits zebra transferred final assembly of its thermal printers to jabil circuit’s facility in guangzhou china in 2009 to the extent zebra relies on a thirdparty provider such as jabil to manufacture its products zebra may incur increased business continuity risks 

zebra is no longer able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of its thermal printers jabil produces if jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility this transition could be costly and time consuming 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both short term and long term on relations with our existing customers a thirdparty provider such as jabil will have access to zebra’s intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks zebra has significant operations overseas which present added risks in addition zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

            

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

    future success will depend on zebra’s ability to cost effectively adapt in this evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a competitive market which may become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to cost effectively provide 

 

    zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the rapid increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth and acquisitions this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our rapid growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

      zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 

  

acquisitions also may involve a number of risks 

 

      future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect our financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

  

zebra’s equipment is subject to us and foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

zebra is implementing a new companywide enterprise resource planning erp system the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will enhance a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that can continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

until the new erp system is fully implemented zebra expects to incur additional selling general and administrative expenses to implement and test the system and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified zebra’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets the possibility of further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

  

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate 

economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions in the united states or internationally or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business as widely reported financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption in 2008 and 2009 including historically high volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations a recurrence of these developments and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers if a slowdown were severe enough it could require further impairment testing and writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets cost reduction actions may be necessary and lead to restructuring charges a tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers suppliers outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg distributors and resellers from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound and the brazilian real could negatively impact product sales margins and collections

 consolidated results of operations – fourth quarter 

sales 

net sales for the 2009 quarter compared with the 2008 quarter decreased 43 due primarily to lower global economic activity the decrease in sales was largely attributable to a decline in hardware sales hardware sales declined proportionally more for our mobile and photo printers the photo printer line was discontinued in 2009 printer unit volume was down 23 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to levels in 2008 

sales by product category were as follows amounts in thousands except percentages 

 

 sales increased in all international territories late in 2008 a notable weakness in sales in europe middle east and africa emea asia pacific and latin america from the economic downturn began and affected sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 these regions started to recover in the fourth quarter of 2009 sales declined overall in 2009 due to the economic downturn emea sales benefitted from a 7000000 increase due to a stronger euro in the fourth quarter of 2009 north american sales declined from the fourth quarter of 2008 as sales a year ago benefitted from shipments of certain larger orders and incremental sales from our zes business unit 

  

sales to customers by geographic region were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 gross profit 

gross profit decreased due to reduced volumes and a less favorable product mix partially offset by a more favorable foreign currency rate environment in 2009 in addition higher freight costs were incurred in order to meet customer demand in the fourth quarter of 2009 these factors were partially offset by the benefit of outsourcing printer production to a third party 

operating expenses 

lower overall operating expenses for the threemonth period resulted from decreases in several categories including compensation costs primarily from lower staffing levels outside commissions project costs and travel and entertainment expenses amortization of intangibles decreased 2063000 and exit restructuring and integration costs decreased 5054000 in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to 2008 amortization decreases were due to intangible asset impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 during the fourth quarter of 2008 we took charges totaling 157600000 for the impairment of goodwill intellectual property and other assets the above reductions in 2009 were partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses for consulting and healthcare costs 

operating expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

 

 other income 

investment income for 2009 declined primarily from lower shortterm interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 2008 a lower foreign exchange gain in 2009 is due to a more stable foreign exchange rate environment in 2009 as compared with 2008 

  

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

 

 operating income loss 

the operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was the result of the non cash impairment charges which totaled 157600000 see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of the asset impairment charges 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 351 compared with 88 for the same quarter last year for 2008 the effective income tax rate was not meaningful because a substantial portion of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 was not deductible for income tax purposes

 specialty printing group – fourth quarter 

net sales in our specialty printing group spg decreased 35 reflecting a decline in north america offset by gains in all other regions new printer products defined as printers released within 18 months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period accounted for 132 of printer sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 186 of printer sales in 2008 

our international spg sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the us dollar british pound and euro this diversity causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates the weaker us dollar to the euro and the pound had a positive impact of approximately 7000000 net of hedges on sales during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 2008 we typically hedge a portion of anticipated eurodenominated sales to partially protect zebra against exchange rate movements for the fourth quarter this program resulted in a loss on hedges of 122000 

  

gross profit margin for spg was affected by lower volumes and a less favorable product mix outsourcing of our manufacturing operations resulted in favorable improvement to gross margin in 2009 offset by higher freight costs the effect of more favorable foreign currency rate environment also increased fourth quarter gross profit by 6293000 net of hedges 

lower overall operating expenses resulted from decreases in payroll costs business development costs recruiting and relocation costs outside commissions project costs travel and entertainment expenses and offsite meetings much of the decreased payroll and benefit costs were a result of lower staffing levels and cost reduction initiatives amortization expense was reduced due to intangible asset writedowns in the fourth quarter of 2008 

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

 

 for 2009 unit volumes compared to 2008 declined most notably in mobile desktop and photo printers partially offset by slightly higher unit sales of high end midrange and kiosk printers 

operating expense changes for spg in 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 are due to the following in thousands 

 

 the 2009 payroll and benefit cost decrease relates to organization changes made in december 2008 which has resulted in lower staffing levels exit and restructuring charges have declined as the activities related to the outsourcing of our printer manufacturing began to ramp down in the fourth quarter of 2009 impairment charges from 2008 relate to the writedown of intellectual property because of changes in valuations related to current economic conditions and the business outlook absent the exit and restructuring costs and impairment charges the remaining reductions in expenses reflect the cost reduction program initiated during the fourth quarter of 2008 that have continued throughout 2009

 zebra enterprise solutions – fourth quarter 

zes sales decreased 121 for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to the challenging economic conditions especially those related to the automotive and maritime industries decreases to hardware services and support were partially offset by increases in license fee revenue margins improved due to right sizing initiatives and expenditure monitoring 

zes operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 are lower than 2008 due to the writedown of assets in the amount of 142920000 related to our recent zes acquisitions and intellectual property because of changes in valuations as a result of economic conditions and the business outlook late in 2008 

other operating expense categories were lower in 2009 due to lower staffing levels which were offset by increased benefit costs commissions and contract employees other operating expense reductions resulted from cost containment efforts collection of previously reserved accounts reduced outside service costs and lower amortization expense

spg had a strong year with its key accounts in 2008 which offset lower demand in the channel in addition to shipments to retailers and small package delivery we also experienced strong sales into healthcare government and mobile workforce 

our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the dollar pound and euro this directly causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates to partially protect zebra against these currency rate fluctuations we hedge a portion of the anticipated eurodenominated sales we estimate that foreign exchange movements of the euro and the pound versus the dollar had a negative impact of 1945000 on sales net of the hedging activities see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a more detailed discussion of our hedging program

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

      

 maintenance and support agreements 

we enter into postcontract maintenance and support agreements revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2009 consisted of the following 

 

  

 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized as of december 31 2009 zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale in addition as of december 31 2009 all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm investments on the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 

see note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for the fair value discussion of auction rate security investment valuations 

  

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

      we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 14 to 38 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2009 were 2186000 or 14 of the balance due we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2009 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 68 to 124 of gross inventory as of december 31 2009 inventory reserves were 9054000 or 102 of gross inventory we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2009 

valuation of goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our annual assessment during june 2009 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may 2009 

goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount examples of such events or circumstances include 

 

        due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we performed an interim test of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2008 and determined that the goodwill associated with our zes segment was impaired see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 

  

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we perform an impairment test the performance of the test involves a twostep process the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values including goodwill we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods income approach – discounted cash flow analysis market approach – guideline public company method and market approach – comparative transactions method 

under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” the key assumptions consider sales cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year 2015 these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions the fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current riskfree rates of capital current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment the company’s risk factors are discussed under item 1a of this form 10k 

under the “market approach – guideline company method” we identified 12 publicly traded companies including zebra which we believe have significant relevant similarities for these 12 companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda similar to the income approach discussed above sales cost of sales operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized the market prices of zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions if these market prices increase the estimated market value would increase if the market prices decrease the estimated market value would decrease 

under the “market approach – comparative transactions method” we looked at 22 market based transactions for companies that have similarities to our business segment including similarities to one or more of the business lines markets growth prospects margins and size we calculated mean revenue and ebitda multiples for the selected transactions these multiples were applied to forecasted zebra results for that segment to estimate market value the key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the “income approach – discounted cash flow analysis” and the “market approach – guideline company method” 

the results of these three methods are weighted based upon managements’ determination with more weighing upon the income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance the market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we determined that our goodwill from our recent zes acquisitions was impaired requiring total estimated goodwill impairment charges of 113679000 at december 31 2008 upon completion of a detailed second step impairment analysis we recorded a credit of 1495000 in the second quarter of 2009 to adjust a portion of the original estimated goodwill impairment for zes 

valuation of longlived and other intangible assets 

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

       

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that certain impairment indicators related to identified intangible assets existed and conducted an additional impairment test of intangibles due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we determined that our other intangible assets consisting of our recent zes acquisitions and intellectual property were impaired requiring total estimated impairment charges of 43921000 at december 31 2008 the intangible asset impairment charges in our spg segment were related primarily to radio frequency identification patents and patent rights the intangible asset impairment charges in our zes segment were related to customer relationships technology third party technology licenses and noncompetition agreements we recorded an impairment charge to a zes intangible asset of 437000 in 2009 

net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 286796000 as of december 31 2009 

income taxes 

on january 1 2007 we adopted asc 740 formerly fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  according to asc 740 we identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions during 2008 we recognized an increase of approximately 4000000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition 

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers specified investment liquidity levels and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under asc 320 formerly sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in over 100 countries throughout the world and therefore at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates on occasion we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 16 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

   

equity price risk 

zebra’s investment manager uses a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent change in the value of all equity positions held by zebra’s investments in thousands except per share data 

 

 from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments however at the end of 2009 zebra held no equity positions

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2009 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young llp’s report is included on page 56 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in january 2008 zebra began a program to update substantially all of its key financial systems over a three year period as pieces of these systems are completed they will be subject to the requirements related to internal control over financial reporting the requirements for internal control over financial reporting will be a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems during 2009 we implemented the following financial systems modules in our us facilities human resources procurement and payables payroll and portions of our general ledger in 2009 we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect and there were no other changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been prevented or detected 

these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all 

  

potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

in 2007 and 2008 we acquired wherenet corp proveo ag navis holdings llc and multispectral solutions inc together these companies comprise our zebra enterprise solutions group esg the acquisitions of these companies expanded the range of identification and tracking solutions we deliver to our customers in addition they provided us with new technologies to offer our customers including active rfid and global positioning systems 

  

gps the products of these companies consist of batterypowered wireless tags fixedposition antennae transponder modules and various application software these companies also provide consulting services maintenance contracts and software licenses 

zebra specialty printing group spg 

we design our printer products to operate at the point of issuance to produce and dispense highquality labels tickets receipts and plastic cards on demand the exceptional diversity of applications using our printer products for barcoding and personal identification is comprised of routing and tracking transactions processing and identification and authentication these applications require high levels of data accuracy where speed and reliability are critical they also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets where improved customer service and productivity gains may be the primary reason for printing rather than a barcoding application plastic cards are used for secure reliable personal identification or access control 

applications for our printing technology span most industries and geographies they include inventory control small package delivery baggage handling automated warehousing jit justintime manufacturing employee time and attendance records file management systems hospital information systems medical specimen labeling shop floor control instore product labeling employee id cards driver’s licenses and access control systems as of december 31 2008 management estimates that zebra has sold more than 7500000 printers to customers around the world 

we believe competitive forces on businesses worldwide to strengthen security reduce costs improve quality deliver better customer service and increase productivity support the adoption of the printing and automatic identification applications zebra provides because these solutions deliver significant and predictable economic benefits industrymandated compliance requirements for bar code labeling and rfid tagging are also important catalysts in the deployment of these systems we also believe that companies are adopting automatic identification systems that incorporate barcoding and rfid for business improvement applications many of these applications make increasing use of enterprisewide resource planning erp and other process improvement systems in manufacturing and service organizations greater emphasis on supply chain management the drive to reduce errors in healthcare and heightened concern over safety and security will lead to increased use of automatic identification systems still other applications are taking advantage of recent advances in wireless and handheld computing technologies 

concern for safety and security and personal identification contribute to demand for our card printer products this concern has heightened interest in systems that provide personal identification and access control including secure id systems for driver’s licenses employee and visitor badges national identification cards event passes club membership cards and keyless entry systems 

our printers are used to produce bar code labels passive rfid “smart” labels receipts plastic identification cards wristbands and tags we also sell related specialty labeling materials thermal ink ribbons and bar code label design and network management software these products are used to provide bar code labeling personal identification and specialty printing solutions principally in the manufacturing supply chain retail healthcare and government sectors of the economy we work closely with distributors resellers kiosk manufacturers and end users of our products to design and implement printing solutions that meet their technical demands to achieve this flexibility we provide our customers with a broad selection of printer models each of which can be configured for a specific application additionally we will select and if necessary create appropriate labeling stock ink ribbons and adhesives to suit a particular application inhouse engineering personnel in software mechanical electronic and chemical engineering participate in the creation and development of printing solutions for particular applications 

we produce the industry’s broadest range of rugged ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal printers our printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs we believe this breadth of product is a unique and significant competitive strength because it allows zebra to satisfy the widest variety of thermal printing applications 

of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most bar code labeling and other ondemand printing applications thermal transfer printing produces dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which 

  

enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where ease of use smaller size and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s mobile and desktop units 

as of december 31 2008 we offered 56 thermal printer models with numerous variations in eight categories as follows 

 

        in addition to their use in ondemand automatic identification applications our thermal printers can also be used for onsite batch production of custom bar code labels and other graphics this capability results in shorter lead times reduced inventory and more flexibility than can be provided with traditional offsite printing 

printer supplies 

supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels wristbands smart labels and tags plastic cards card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons zebra promotes the use of genuine zebra brand supplies with its equipment 

zebra fully supports its printers resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality highperformance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs supplies are chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform these printing solutions frequently include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed to optimize image resolution and printer performance while meeting the most demanding end user application performance criteria factors such as adhesion resistance to scratches smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials the use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade image quality and decrease the part life of key printer components such as printheads 

printer related software 

zebra has specialized printer management label design and driver solutions to help unlock the full potential of zebra printers the zebralink solutions suite of networking software firmware offerings combined with the enhanced printer management capabilities of zebranet™ bridge makes zebra’s printers easy to use and integrate into small medium and enterprisewide environments our goal is to provide software that enables high levels of functionality to all major computer network and software systems network systems include ethernet 80211bg and bluetooth ®  in 2008 a mobile printerbased software development kit was introduced to aid with integration into windows mobile ® applications zebra also introduced zbi 20 an optional printer programming language which allows customers to create and run customized applications on zebra printers 

  

zebra offers label design and integration software specifically designed to optimize the performance of zebra bar code label printers zebra’s suite of label design and printer configuration tools includes zebradesigner™ zebradesigner™ pro zebradesigner™ for xml and zebradesigner™ label design software for use with mysap™ business suite in 2008 zebra added the enterprise connector solution for oracle ® business intelligence publisher™ which delivers seamless integration between oracle and zebra printers creating a versatile easily managed costeffective printing platform

printer warranties 

in general zebra provides warranty coverage of one year on printers against defects in material and workmanship printheads are warranted for nine months and batteries are warranted for three months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair or replacement during the applicable warranty periods 

zebra’s printer technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines use thermal printing either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this benefits applications needing simple reliable operation such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications like circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels requiring resistance to chemicals temperature extremes abrasion or long life performance midrange printengines and some desktop printers use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye into a plastic card or treated paper this creates full color photographic quality images wellsuited to driver licenses access and identification cards transaction cards and ondemand photographs our card printers use dyesublimation printing 

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speed making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable bar codes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband 

  

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and firmware enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure durability special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift firmware supports serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211bg wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as zebra programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml this makes the printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux msdos ®  or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts for media and consumables we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region andor vertical market 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in vertical markets we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs including consistent support for projects and applications are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a group that manages a small number of global alliances they direct the business development strategies for a limited number of thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

marketing marketing operations encompass corporate marketing marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research and channel marketing functions corporate marketing conducts activities to enhance the zebra corporate brand corporate public relations internal corporate communications and our web site the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses 

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship in february 2008 we announced that final printer assembly will be transferred to a thirdparty manufacturer jabil circuit inc by the end of 2009 this action is intended to optimize our global printer product supply chain by improving responsiveness to customer needs and increasing zebra’s flexibility to meet emerging business 

  

opportunities see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the transfer and transition process 

during the transition we will continue to manufacture some printers at our domestic factories while increasing production by jabil to ensure consistent flow of product to our customers in our factories we assemble our products largely on a configuretoorder basis using components that are sourced from around the world we have the inhouse capability to produce mechanical assemblies and design many of our own tools fixtures and test equipment we currently buy prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of our products critical subassemblies include printheads printed circuit board assemblies power supplies integrated circuits and stepper motors which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers purchase contracts provide for price variation in the event of commodity price changes in the cost of raw materials zebra typically experiences significant variance in demand and thus carries inventory and partners with key suppliers to deal with the variation purchases of these components by zebra will decline as printer assembly directly by zebra declines and assembly by jabil increases 

over the remainder of 2009 we will continue to transfer the assembly of printer product lines to jabil during the transition our goal is to decrease inhouse printer production by printer line as the assembly of those printer lines by jabil increases we will maintain assembly of those printers inhouse until jabil’s quality and production yields reach acceptable levels to ensure product availability to meet customer demands for this reason we expect inventories could temporarily rise until all printer manufacturing is transferred inhouse assembly lines are shut down and excess inventories are sold down 

jabil will produce our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order zebra will maintain control of the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of component parts jabil is responsible for the procurement of the component parts and subassemblies used in the zebra printers it produces zebra has subsidiary located in guangzhou china and has an office within 10 minutes of the jabil facility in china where the zebra products are assembled this office is staffed with zebra sourcing engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal pricing on raw materials and the final printers meet our quality standards zebra printers manufactured by jabil are shipped to zebra’s regional distribution centers the majority of the product will pass directly through to zebra’s customers but a small percentage will be reconfigured through firmware downloads packaging and some other customization before they are shipped to customers in addition certain products will be manufactured in accordance with federal procurement regulations and various international trade agreements and remain eligible for sale to the united states government 

printer competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers rfid printerencoders and card personalization solutions 

we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems printerencoders mobile printers and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as inkjet and laser printing many of these companies are substantially larger than zebra 

dye sublimation the technology used in our card printers is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications 

  

support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition from many competitors including the following listed in alphabetical order altech argox avery dennison boca systems brother international canon cim citizen cognitivetpg colorx copal custom danaher datacard datamaxo’neil a unit of dover corporation dymo a newell rubbermaid company epson evolis extech fargo electronics fuji godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec technologies lexmark international logickacomp magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs nisca oki data olmec olympus practical automation printronix sato seiko instruments shinko song woo electronics sony star micronics taiwan semiconductor toshibatec victor data systems woosim and xerox 

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

alternative printer technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the label card and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as complementary technologies to bar coded printing offering growth opportunities to zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printing and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support their standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge

customers 

zebra has sold over 7500000 thermal printers to customers as of december 31 2008 

scansource inc is our most significant customer our net sales to scansource an international distributor of zebra spg products as a percent of our total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

sales 

net sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

 the increase in service and software net sales in 2008 is due to our esg acquisitions 

  

net sales to international customers as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

 

 we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 26 different countries 

research and development 

zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our efficiently manufactured products maintain high levels of reliability research and development resources are also directed toward enhancing our enterprise solutions systems the increase in research and development expenditures for esg in 2008 is mainly attributed to the acquisition of navis holdings llc late in 2007 

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect many domestic and international trademarks we hold 320 united states and foreign patents and have 171 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 2 to 23 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success 

patents have become increasingly used by businesses generally as a strategic business tool and in recent years the number of patent applications and grants has risen dramatically as a result it is increasingly important that zebra takes appropriate steps to maintain and develop its own patent portfolio and reduce the risk of disputes involving third party intellectual property rights

current economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations  adverse economic conditions in the united states or internationally or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business a substantial portion of our business depends on our customers’ demand for our products and services the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions as widely reported financial markets throughout the world have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions these developments and the related general economic downturn will adversely impact zebra’s business and financial condition in a number of ways including impacts beyond those typically associated with other recent downturns in the us and foreign economies the slowdown will likely lead to reduced information technology spending by end users which has already adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect zebra’s product sales if the slowdown is severe enough it could necessitate further testing for impairment of goodwill as well as the writedown of other intangible assets beyond those already recognized in addition cost reduction actions may be necessary which would lead to additional restructuring charges the current tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn will likely adversely affect the ability of zebra’s customers suppliers outsource manufacturer and channel partners eg distributors and resellers to obtain financing for significant purchases the tightening could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for zebra’s products and services could negatively impact zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis could result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required and in the event of the contraction in zebra’s sales could lead to dated inventory and require additional reserves for obsolescence significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro the british pound and the brazilian real could negatively impact zebra’s customer pricing and adversely affect zebra’s results 

zebra is unable to predict the duration and severity of the current economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on zebra’s business and results of operations but the consequences may be materially adverse and more severe than other recent economic slowdowns 

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products for example in 2007 and 2008 zebra acquired wherenet corp proveo ag navis holdings llc and multispectral solutions inc which together comprise what we refer to as the zebra enterprise solutions group an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including risks with respect to 

 

        

moreover zebra may be unable to identify negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses 

zebra enterprise solutions group is a new business prior to the purchases in 2007 zebra had no experience operating businesses which are in the business conducted by zebra enterprise solutions group the zebra enterprise solutions group provides enterprise software solutions to customers which require implementation in complex environments over extended periods of time and use percentageofcompletion accounting which has not been zebra’s historic business 

zebra may be a party to fixed price contracts particularly for its esg unit that could become unfavorable contracts from time to time esg may enter into contracts to provide services to customers for fixed fees such a contract could result in material loss to zebra if the cost to perform such contract ultimately exceeds the fees earned on such contract 

zebra is transferring final assembly of its thermal printers to jabil circuit and will be totally dependent on jabil for the manufacturing of such printers a failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results zebra expects this transfer to be complete by the end of 2009 in an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operational benefits zebra has expanded its outsourcing activities to include the transfer of the final assembly of its thermal printers to jabil circuit’s facility in huangpu china 

however to the extent zebra relies on a third party service provider such as jabil for manufacturing services zebra may incur increased business continuity risks zebra will no longer be able to exercise control over the assembly of its thermal printers or any related operations or processes including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted by jabil and the quality of zebra’s products assembled by jabil if zebra is unable to effectively develop and implement its outsourcing strategy it may not realize cost structure efficiencies and its operating and its financial results could be materially adversely affected 

during the transition period zebra’s printers will be manufactured both in the united states by zebra and in china by jabil if zebra is unable to effectively manage its inventory levels during the period of concurrent manufacturing it may not have sufficient inventories to meet customer needs at the same time difficulty managing inventory during the transition could lead to excess and obsolete inventory and related resulting losses 

in addition if jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to meet production requirements may lose revenue and may not be able to maintain its relationships with its customers without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products and the continuing operation of jabil’s facility zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on zebra’s operating and financial results 

the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in foreign jurisdictions may lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and customer concern may exist regarding the continuity of a high level of service delivery the extent and pace at which zebra is able to move manufacturing functions to jabil’s facility and the extent to which its customers are affected by the transfer may be impacted by regulatory and customer acceptance issues 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount it considers adequate this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with zebra’s existing customers resulting from zebra’s inability to produce products for them 

a third party service provider such as jabil will have access to zebra’s intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 

  

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers in addition the transfer of final assembly of its thermal printers to a chinese facility began in 2008 and is expected to conclude in 2009 these circumstances create a number of risks zebra has significant overseas operations including in particular an increasing presence in china which presents added risks in addition zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

            zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

     future success will depend on zebra’s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a highly competitive market which is likely to become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to provide 

 

    zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer 

  

support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products any of these factors could reduce zebra’s earnings 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the rapid increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth and acquisitions this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our rapid growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

     if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers a zebra supplier has in the past provided us with defective lithiumion battery packs which were subject to a product recall zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

larger orders may take longer to close and may not be completely fulfilled during a particular quarter zebra has been pursuing larger customer orders which typically involve a longer sales cycle such orders are more difficult to forecast and whether a larger order is received by zebra in a particular quarter or deferred to a later quarter could have a material effect on the financial results of zebra from quarter to quarter 

  

zebra’s equipment is subject to us and foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

zebra is implementing a new companywide enterprise resource planning erp system the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will provide a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that can continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

until the new erp system is fully implemented zebra expects to incur additional selling general and administrative expenses to stabilize the system and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified zebra’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 

economic factors that are outside zebra’s control could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra’s accounts receivables zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra’s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for personnel in zebra’s industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war 

  

risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate

our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the dollar pound and euro this directly causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates to partially protect zebra against these currency rate fluctuations we hedge a portion of the anticipated eurodenominated sales we estimate that foreign exchange movements of the euro and the pound versus the dollar had a negative impact of 6540000 on sales net of the hedging activities during the fourth quarter of 2008 for the full year there was a net positive impact of the currency rate fluctuations and hedging activities of 5586000 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a more detailed discussion of our hedging program

gross profit margin for esg in 2008 were significantly higher than in 2007 due to the margins of the software business added in late 2007 as a result of the navis acquisition being significantly higher than the hardware business we had in 2007 

esg results for the fourth quarter of 2008 reflect spending rates for all of the businesses acquired during 2007 and 2008 that comprise esg the operating expenses for esg for all of 2008 are not comparable to the operating expenses for 2007 because the operating expenses for 2007 do not include the financial results for all of those businesses esg’s fourth quarter results also reflect a reduction in operating expenses during the second half of the year these cost reduction efforts reduced esg’s employee count by approximately 40 operating expenses for the fourth quarter and the full year reflect a writedown of assets in the amount of 142920000 related to our recent esg acquisitions and intellectual property because of changes in valuations as a result of the current economic conditions and the business outlook

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding growth rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual growth rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

  

     maintenance and support agreements 

we enter into postcontract maintenance and support agreements revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2008 consisted of the following 

 

 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized as of december 31 2008 zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale in addition as of december 31 2008 all of our investments in marketable debt securities with 

  

maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm investments on the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 

see note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for the fair value discussion of auction rate security investment valuations 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

      we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 06 to 33 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2008 were 2734000 or 18 of the balance due we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2008 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 59 to 142 of gross inventory as of december 31 2008 inventory reserves were 7172000 or 67 of gross inventory we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2008 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our annual assessment during june 2008 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may 2008 

goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount examples of such events or circumstances include 

 

          

due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock we performed an interim test of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2008 and determined that the goodwill associated with our esg segment was impaired see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

     if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that certain impairment indicators existed related to identified intangible assets in both our spg and esg businesses and conducted a special impairment test of intangibles this test resulted in an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2008 see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 

net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 293078000 as of december 31 2008 

income taxes on january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  according to fin no 48 we identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions during 2008 we recognized an increase of approximately 4000000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to a recent zebra acquisition a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands

zebra concluded us federal income tax audits for tax years 2005 and 2006 during 2008 the 2007 tax year is open to audit as a result of the concluded audits additional income tax expense in the amount of 758949 was incurred in addition interest expense in the amount of 146937 net of tax benefits was incurred these amounts are included as part of current year income tax expense the tax years 2004 through 2007 remain open to examination by various state taxing jurisdictions tax authorities in the united kingdom have completed income tax audits through tax years ending december 31 2006

             in february 2008 we announced that printer manufacturing is being transferred to a thirdparty manufacturer this transition is expected to be completed by the end of 2009 see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and therefore are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 16 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

   

equity price risk 

zebra currently employs two investment managers these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent change in the value of all equity positions held by zebra’s investment managers in thousands except per share data 

 

 from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures 

not applicable 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive office and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report on form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2008 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting that report is included on page 49 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in january 2008 zebra began a program to update substantially all of its key financial systems over a three year period the requirements for internal controls over financial reporting are a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems as pieces of these systems are implemented we conduct appropriate levels of testing and monitoring of the systems and update our internal controls over financial reporting with respect to the impacted areas in 2008 we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect and there were no other changes that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been detected 

these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance 

  

that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

on internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and stockholders 

of zebra technologies corporation 

we have audited zebra technologies corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria zebra technologies corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion zebra technologies corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of zebra technologies corporation as of december 31 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements of earnings loss comprehensive income loss stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 and our report dated february 27 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix management believes that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most bar code labeling applications thermal transfer printing produces dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where ease of use smaller size and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s mobile and desktop units 

  

as of december 31 2007 we offered 56 thermal printer models with numerous variations in nine categories as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to their use in ondemand automatic identification applications our thermal printers can also be used for onsite batch production of custom bar code labels and other graphics this capability results in shorter lead times reduced inventory and more flexibility than can be provided with traditional offsite printing 

printer supplies 

supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels wristbands smart labels and tags plastic cards card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons zebra promotes the use of genuine zebra brand supplies with its equipment 

zebra fully supports its printers resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality highperformance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs supplies are chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform these printing solutions frequently include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed to optimize image resolution and printer performance while meeting the most demanding end user application performance criteria factors such as adhesion resistance to scratches smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials the use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade image quality and decrease the part life of key printer components such as printheads 

printer related software 

zebra has specialized printer management label design and driver solutions to help unlock the full potential of zebra printers the zebralink solutions suite of networking software firmware offerings combined with the enhanced 

  

printer management capabilities of zebranet™ bridge makes zebra’s printers easy to use and integrate into small medium and enterprisewide environments our goal is to provide software that enables high levels of functionality to all major computer network and software systems network systems include ethernet 80211bg and bluetooth™ wireless systems in 2007 zebra added support for enhanced 80211bg wireless securities including wpa and wpa2 

zebra offers label design and integration software specifically designed to optimize the performance of zebra bar code label printers in addition to zebra’s existing label design and printer configuration tools zebradesigner™ zebradesigner™ pro and zebradesigner™ for xml we added zebradesigner™ label design software for use with mysap™ business suite in 2007 making it possible to design labels and print to zebra printers from sap™ without the need for middleware or additional programming 

printer maintenance and services 

zebra provides depot maintenance and repair services at repair centers in vernon hills illinois camarillo california canada preston uk china and the netherlands zebra authorized service providers zasp also provide repair services for most zebra products at their locations in addition zebra offers onsite repair services for tabletop printers in the united states outside of the united states zebra’s resellers may provide maintenance service either directly as zasps or through independent service agents zebra also provides technical support from inhouse support personnel located in the united states the united kingdom and singapore for most zebra products zebra provides interactive technical support via the internet at wwwzebracom  24 hours per day seven days per week 

printer warranties 

in general zebra provides warranty coverage of one year on printers against defects in material and workmanship printheads are warranted for nine months and batteries are warranted for three months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair replacement or refund during the applicable warranty periods 

zebra’s printer technology 

our customers rely on zebra to provide products and systems to identify authenticate track or route both items and people and then process the related transactions these products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each application 

all zebra printers and print engines use thermal printing either direct thermal printing thermal transfer printing or dyesublimation printing this technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heatsensitive substrate 

direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermallysensitive label wristband or receipt to create an image this benefits applications needing simple reliable operation such as shelf labeling patient identification and kiosk receipts some desktop label printers mobile printers and kiosk printers support only direct thermal printing 

thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags this allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications like circuit board labels chemical identification and product labels requiring resistance to chemicals temperature extremes abrasion or long life performance midrange printengines and some desktop printers use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing 

dyesublimation printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye into a plastic card or treated paper this creates full color photographic quality images wellsuited to driver licenses access and identification cards transaction cards and ondemand photographs our card printers and digital photo printers use dyesublimation printing 

  

direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speed making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable bar codes dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create fullcolor images with visual characteristics more similar to halidebased film than to pixelbased ink jet or laser printers making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized plastic cards some printers also include hf 1356 mhz or uhf 860960 mhz rfid technology that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in a label card or wristband these “smart labels” are finding growing acceptance in commercial and military supply chain management as well as many closedloop tracking applications 

zebra’s printers integrate companydesigned mechanisms electrical systems and firmware enclosures of metal or highimpact plastic ensure durability special mechanisms optimize handling of labels ribbons and plastic cards fast highcurrent electrical systems provide consistent image quality mobile printers use nimh or liion batteries to optimize print quality over an extended operating shift firmware supports serial parallel ethernet usb infrared bluetooth or 80211bg wireless communications with appropriate security protocols printing instructions can be received as a proprietary language such as zebra programming language ii zpl ii ®  as a print driverprovided image or as userdefined xml this makes the printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on unix linux msdos ®  or microsoft ® windows ® operating systems some independent software vendors including adobe oracle and sap have included zebra printing support in applications for healthcare warehouse management manufacturing passenger transportation and retailing 

printer sales and marketing 

sales we sell our printer products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named accounts for media and consumables we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region andor vertical market 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and rfid products in vertical markets we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs including consistent support for projects and applications are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a group that manages a small number of global alliances they direct the business development strategies for a limited number of thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

marketing marketing operations encompass marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research and channel marketing functions the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses 

  

printer production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship in february 2008 we announced that printer manufacturing will be transferred to a thirdparty manufacturer this transition is expected to occur over the next 18 to 24 months see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the transfer and transition process prior to the recently announced transfer to a thirdparty manufacturer we assembled our products inhouse largely on a configuretoorder basis using components that have been sourced from around the world we have the inhouse capability to produce mechanical assemblies and design many of our own tools fixtures and test equipment often our manufacturing and test engineers coordinate the development of new products with our new product engineers and vendors this collaboration increases manufacturing efficiency by specifying and designing manufacturing processes and facilities simultaneously with product design 

we buy prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of our products critical subassemblies include printheads printed circuit board assemblies power supplies integrated circuits and stepper motors which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices purchase contracts provide for price increases only in the event of certain increases in the costs of raw materials zebra typically experiences significant variance in demand and thus carries inventory and partners with key suppliers to deal with the variation 

printer competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers card personalization solutions and dye sublimation photo printers we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as impact dot matrix inkjet and laser printing similarly we consider manufacturers of card personalization systems that are based on a broad range of alternative technologies as competition 

dye sublimation the technology incorporated in our card printer is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies manufacturers also use dye sublimation technology in their digital photo printers 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition in one or more of our product lines from many competitors including the following listed in alphabetical order altech argox canon cim cognitive solutions a subsidiary of axiohm transaction solutions colorx copal datacard datamax a unit of dover corporation evolis fargo electronics fuji godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec technologies lexmark international logickacomp magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs nisca olmec o’neil product development olympus paxar polaroid printronix sato shinko song woo electronics sony taiwan semiconductor tokyo electric company victor data systems woosim and xerox competition in the kiosk arena is vast a few of the competitors we face include custom engineering star micronics epson citizen boca systems and practical automation 

  

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

alternative printer technologies 

we believe thermal printing will be the label card and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view passive rfid smart label encoding and active rfid location systems as complementary technologies to bar coded printing offering significant growth opportunities to zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted 

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printer and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser and direct marking while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels cards and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of thermal printing for our targeted applications we continually monitor and evaluate new rfid technologies support their standards development and rapidly adopt rfid into new zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge 

zebra enterprise solutions 

in 2007 we acquired wherenet corp proveo ag and navis holdings llc which we refer to as zebra enterprise solutions in 2008 we will be integrating these businesses into a single business unit and intend to report their results separately from our specialty printing business together these companies give zebra the ability to deliver more highvalue applications that help our customers identify track and manage assets transactions and people we consider these solutions natural adjacencies to our core specialty printing business 

the solutions these companies provide are sold on a contract basis and are typically installed over several quarters these contracts cover a range of services including design installation and ongoing maintenance services

customers 

zebra has sold over 6000000 thermal printers to customers in about 100 countries as of december 31 2007 

scansource inc is our most significant customer our net sales to scansource an international distributor of zebra products as a percent of our total net sales were as follows 

 

 no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

sales 

sales by product category for the last three years were in thousands 

 

 sales to international customers as a percent of net sales were as follows 

 

 we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 26 different countries 

research and development 

zebra had research and development expenditures as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our efficiently manufactured products maintain high levels of reliability research and development resources are also directed toward enhancing our enterprise solutions systems 

  

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect many domestic and international trademarks we hold 292 united states and foreign patents and have 225 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 5 months to 18 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success 

patents have become increasingly used by businesses generally as a strategic business tool and in recent years the number of patent applications and grants has risen dramatically as a result it is increasingly important that zebra takes appropriate steps to maintain and develop its own patent portfolio and reduce the risk of disputes involving third party intellectual property rights 

other trademarks mentioned in this report are the property of their respective holders and include ibm a registered trademark of international business machines kodak a registered trademark of eastman kodak unix a registered trademark of unix systems laboratories msdos and windows registered trademarks of microsoft sap a registered trademark of sap ag linux a registered trademark of linus torvalds and accelio present central a registered trademark of accelio bluetooth is a trademark owned by bluetooth sig and used by zebra under license 

employees 

as of january 25 2008 zebra employed approximately 3200 persons none of these employees is a member of a union we consider our employee relations to be very good 

additional information 

for financial information regarding zebra see zebra’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes which are included in this annual report on form 10k zebra has a single reportable segment for all of our operations and products financial information about geographic areas is found in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results and growth prospects 

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the writeoff of certain acquisition costs 

zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products for example in 2007 zebra acquired wherenet corp proveo ag and navis holdings llc which together comprise what we refer to as the zebra enterprise solutions business an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized acquisitions also may involve a number of risks including risks with respect to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 moreover zebra may be unable to identify negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition which could be significant 

zebra enterprise solutions is a new business zebra has no prior experience operating businesses which are in the business conducted by zebra enterprise solutions the zebra enterprise solutions business provides enterprise software solutions to customers which require implementation in complex environments over extended periods of time and use percentageofcompletion accounting which has not been zebra’s historic business in addition these companies were privatelyheld and therefore not subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 many steps must be taken for them to become compliant during 2008 which will result in significant cost until they are in compliance their noncompliance could result in risks to our business 

zebra is transferring final assembly of its thermal printers to jabil circuit and will be totally dependent on jabil for the manufacturing of such printers any failure by jabil to provide manufacturing services to zebra as zebra requires or any disruption in such manufacturing services may adversely affect zebra’s business results zebra expects this transfer to be complete in the next 1824 months 

in an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operational benefits zebra has expanded its outsourcing activities to include the transfer of the final assembly of its thermal printers to jabil circuit’s facility in huangpu china 

however to the extent zebra relies on a third party service provider such as jabil for manufacturing services zebra may incur increased business continuity risks zebra will no longer be able to exercise control over the assembly of its thermal printers or any related operations or processes including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted by jabil and the quality of zebra’s products assembled by jabil if zebra is unable to effectively develop and implement its outsourcing strategy it may not realize cost structure efficiencies and its operating and its financial results could be materially adversely affected 

  

in addition if for any reason jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet zebra’s manufacturing needs then zebra may be unable to meet production requirements may lose revenue and may not be able to maintain its relationships with its customers without jabil’s continuing manufacture of zebra’s products and the continuing operation of jabil’s facility zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers until zebra is able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on zebra’s operating and financial results 

the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in foreign jurisdictions may lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and customer concern may exist regarding the continuity of a high level of service delivery the extent and pace at which zebra is able to move manufacturing functions to jabil’s facility and the extent to which its customers are affected by the transfer may be impacted by regulatory and customer acceptance issues 

although zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount it considers adequate this insurance does not cover all possible situations in addition the business interruption insurance would not compensate zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact both shortterm and longterm on relations with zebra’s existing customers resulting from zebra’s inability to produce products for them 

a third party service provider such as jabil will have access to zebra’s intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property 

adverse economic conditions in the united states or internationally or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

a substantial portion of our business depends on our customers’ demand for our products and services the overall economic health of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions these risks become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak or unfavorable economic conditions in the united states or internationally or within our customers’ respective industries or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve would likely adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services and reduced unit sales 

zebra has significant operations outside the united states and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers in addition the final assembly of its thermal printers is being transferred to a chinese facility these circumstances create a number of risks 

zebra has significant overseas operations notably in the united kingdom europe middle east and africa latin america and asia pacific including in particular an increasing presence in china which presents added risks in addition zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 

risks associated with operations sales and purchases outside the united states include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 

to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

 

  

  

  

  

 future success will depend on zebra’s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a highly competitive market which is likely to become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 

zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to provide 

 

  

  

  

 zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products any of these factors could reduce zebra’s earnings 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the rapid increase in the complexity of its business  

zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth and acquisitions this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our rapid growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected in addition we may have difficulties managing associated increased costs which could adversely affect our operating margins 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers 

a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

  

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 

third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged 

zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  

zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers a zebra supplier has in the past provided us with defective lithiumion battery packs which were subject to a product recall zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

larger orders may take longer to close and may not be completely fulfilled during a particular quarter 

zebra has been pursuing larger customer orders which typically involve a longer sales cycle such orders are more difficult to forecast and whether a larger order is received by zebra in a particular quarter or deferred to a later quarter could have a material effect on the financial results of zebra from quarter to quarter 

zebra’s equipment is subject to us and foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business 

these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 

zebra is implementing a new companywide enterprise resource planning erp system the implementation process is complex and involves a number of risks that may adversely affect zebra’s business and results of operations 

zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new companywide integrated enterprise resource planning erp system to handle various business operating and financial processes for zebra and its subsidiaries the new system will provide a variety of important functions such as order entry invoicing accounts receivable accounts payable financial consolidation logistics and internal and external financial and management reporting matters 

  

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation activities that can continue for several years such an integrated widescale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system significant efforts are required for requirements identification functional design process documentation data conversion user training and post implementation support problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or production missed sales billing and accounting errors and other operational issues system delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its consolidated operations its financial position and cash flows which could impact zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

until the new erp system is fully implemented and stabilized zebra expects to incur additional selling general and administrative expenses to stabilize the system and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified zebra’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if it experiences operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits 

economic factors that are outside zebra’s control could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra’s accounts receivables 

zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra’s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 

the future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for personnel in zebra’s industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability 

the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 

zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

  

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding growth rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual growth rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

from time to time zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2007 consisted of the following 

 

 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale except for partnership interests described below 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized as of december 31 2007 zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale in addition as of december 31 2007 all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm investments on the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 

we account for the partnership interests using the cost method until our ownership percentage in a partnership reaches 5 of the total partnership portfolio value at that time we begin using the equity method to account for that particular partnership during 2006 we reached the 5 threshold on one of our partnership interests during 2007 we liquidated this partnership interest during the fourth quarter of 2007 we also liquidated 95 of two other partnership interests with the balances in all remaining partnership interests to be liquidated in 2008 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts and notes receivable reserves varied from 06 to 33 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2007 were 5075000 or 33 of the balance due we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2007 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

  

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our inventory reserves have ranged from 96 to 142 of gross inventory as of december 31 2007 inventory reserves were 8999000 or 96 of gross inventory we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2007 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our last assessment during june 2007 at that time no adjustment to goodwill was necessary due to impairment 

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 433620000 as of december 31 2007 

income taxes 

on january 1 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  according to fin no 48 we identified evaluated and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions the net income tax assets recognized under fin no 48 did not differ from the net assets recognized before adoption and therefore we did not record an adjustment related to the adoption of fin no 48 zebra did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2007 

zebra has concluded all us federal income tax audits for years through 2004 the tax years 2004 through 2007 remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions 

zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2007 we did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense 

contingencies 

we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

for a discussion of all current litigation matters see note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k 

  

stockbased compensation 

as of december 31 2007 zebra had two stockbased compensation plans available for future grants as of january 1 2006 zebra adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment utilizing the modified retrospective approach which requires the prior period financial statements to be restated to recognize compensation costs in the amounts previously reporting in the pro forma footnote disclosures see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k for further information on the adoption and impact of sfas no 123r 

liquidity and capital resources 

during 2007 zebra purchased wherenet corp for 127450000 proveo ag for 15467000 and navis llc for 143844000 as a result zebra’s cash and investment balances decreased to 281179000 at december 31 2007 compared with 559189000 at december 31 2006 other factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2007 include note that changes discussed below include the impact of foreign currency 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in february 2008 we announced that printer manufacturing will be transferred to a thirdparty manufacturer this transition is expected to occur over the next 18 to 24 months see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 were 

 

 purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials 

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements in addition it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement will be effective for zebra beginning in fiscal 2008 and we are in the process of determining any potential impact to the financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities which allows entities to voluntarily choose at specified election dates to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain nonfinancial instruments at fair value the “fair value option” the election is made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis and is irrevocable if the fair value option is elected for an instrument the statement specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall be reported in earnings this statement is effective for zebra for the fiscal year ending december 31 2008 we have not yet determined the effect this statement will have on our operations or financial position 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations  to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations sfas no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination this statement applies to fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will generally affect acquisitions going forward 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

 because these securities are classified as availableforsale under sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and therefore are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 15 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

   

equity price risk 

zebra currently employs five investment managers three of which manage portfolios of investment funds ie fund of funds these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities by policy management limits the amount of zebra’s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of 15 of the total investment portfolio with no single investment exceeding 15000000 zebra is currently in the process of liquidating all of our partnership interests 

zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent change in the value of all equity positions held by zebra’s investment managers in thousands except per share data 

 

 from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework we completed our acquisitions of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc on january 25 2007 and december 14 2007 respectively as permitted by the us securities and exchange commission management’s assessment as of december 31 2007 did not include the internal control of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc which are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2007 wherenet llc constituted 139958 and 118242 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2007 and 27308 and 10856 of revenues and net income loss respectively for the year then ended navis holdings llc constituted 174542 and 156887 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2007 and 3129 and 190 of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended all numbers referenced above for wherenet llc and navis holdings llc are state in thousands 

based on management’s assessment which excluded an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of the acquired operations of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2007 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on zebra’s internal control over financial reporting that report is included on page 41 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during 2007 we made changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been detected 

  

these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

on internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and stockholders 

of zebra technologies corporation 

we have audited zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria zebra technologies corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc which are included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation wherenet llc constituted 139958 and 118242 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2007 and 27308 and 10856 of revenues and net income loss respectively for the year then ended navis holdings llc constituted 174542 and 156887 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2007 and 3129 and 190 of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended zebra technologies corporation completed its acquisitions of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc on january 25 2007 and december 14 2007 respectively and as permitted by the us securities and exchange commission’s guidance management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc our audit of internal control over financial reporting of zebra technologies corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of wherenet llc and navis holdings llc

sales of hardware printers and replacement parts and supplies were as follows in thousands 

   

label and receipt printers 

we produce the industry’s broadest range of rugged ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal printers our printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs we believe this breadth of product is a unique and significant competitive strength because it allows zebra to satisfy the widest variety of thermal printing applications 

of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix management believes that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most bar code labeling applications thermal transfer printing produces dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these 

images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where ease of use smaller size and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s mobile and desktop units 

as of december 31 2006 we offered 42 bar code printer models with numerous variations including 

performance tabletop printers zebra produces highend printers targeted at applications requiring continuous operation in high output missioncritical and industrial settings these units provide a wide variety of optional configurations features print widths speeds and dot densities we offer four models under the xiiii plus series line list prices range from 2995 to 7495

rfid printerencoders zebra manufactures and markets a growing line of printerencoders used for high frequency hf and ultrahigh frequency uhf radio frequency identification rfid in the retail supply chain for defense logistics and other applications these units are used to print and encode “smart labels” in a single pass smart labels are printable labels embedded with an ultrathin radio frequency transponder information encoded in these transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader zebra offers five rfid and two rfidready printerencoders which have list prices from 1695 to 6995

in addition to their use in ondemand automatic identification applications our thermal printers can also be used for onsite batch production of custom bar code labels and other graphics this capability results in shorter lead times reduced inventory and more flexibility than can be provided with traditional offsite printing 

card printers 

zebra makes 10 card printer models for printing national identity cards driver’s licenses employee identification badges smart cards ondemand access control cards gift cards and customer loyalty cards these cards can typically be printed in seconds for less than one dollar each users can select from a number of printer options including monochrome and color printing single and twosided printing lamination and magnetic stripe and smart card encoding bar codes smart chips and magnetic stripe encoding can be used to record such personal data as health records financial transactions security access codes and vital statistics from the middle of 2006 all zebra color card printers are “iseries” card printers which incorporate features that automatically optimize printer settings for a given ribbon the list prices for all of zebra’s card printers range from 1995 to 7995 

photo printers 

digital photo printing is an extension of our core thermal printing technology with the november 2003 acquisition of atlantek we began producing digital photo printers we currently manufacture two printers jointly developed with and marketed by eastman kodak our highspeed thermal photo printer is designed to work as part of a photo kiosk or a standalone in professional photography applications we currently sell this printer on an oem basis to eastman kodak 

which incorporates the printer into kodak photo kiosks and markets the standalone version as the kodak professional 9810 digital photo printer 

supplies 

supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels wristbands smart labels and tags plastic cards card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons zebra promotes the use of genuine zebra brand supplies with its equipment 

zebra fully supports its printers resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality high performance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs supplies are chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform in the case of bar code labeling solutions supplies also include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed to maximize bar code decoding and printer performance while meeting the most demanding end user application performance criteria factors such as adhesion resistance to scratches smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials the use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade bar code decoding rates print speed and print quality 

software 

zebra has specialized printer management label design and driver solutions to help unlock the full potential of zebra printers the zebralink solutions suite of networking software firmware and printer management products is designed for ease of integration and use from small business to enterprise supply chain applications our goal is to provide software that enables high levels of functionality to all major computer network and software systems network systems include ethernet 80211bg with advanced securities and bluetooth™ wireless systems operating systems include windows unix linux and various ibm systems 

the zebranet bridge enterprise printer management application enables organizations to efficiently deploy manage and monitor zebra printers from a single location leveraging the powerful printer management features built into many zebra printers and zebra print servers zebranet bridge enterprise delivers realtime printer error and status notifications for maximum uptime performance easy to use and flexible tools within the program allow system administrators to create highly manageable printer groups for realtime control and monitoring of zebra printers on their network

warranties 

all zebra printing equipment is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for up to one year printheads are warranted for six months and batteries are warranted for three months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair replacement or refund during the applicable warranty periods 

zebra’s technology 

our products use thermal transfer direct thermal and thermal dye sublimation technologies each technology has characteristics that provide specific benefits to the end user 

thermal transfer printing is used in all performance and some midrange desktop and mobile bar code label printers as well as highspeed print engines this technology creates an image by applying an electrically heated printhead to a ribbon that releases ink onto labelingticketing media the benefits of thermal transfer printing include superior image quality the ability to print on a wide variety of smoothsurfaced materials no requirement for specially coated or formulated labelingticketing media and the ability to use inks that are not viable with alternative printing technologies 

direct thermal printing is used in some midrange desktop and mobile printer products direct thermal printing creates an image by applying the heated printhead directly to specially treated paper which changes color when heated direct thermal technology is preferable where image durability is less critical and where the application does not require specialtylabeling materials such as plastics or metal foils 

our card printers and digital photo printers incorporate thermal dye sublimation for color printing this capability allows for the creation of personalized full color photographic quality plastic cards and highquality photographs traditional photographic processes are both more expensive and time consuming we believe that personalized card applications such as driver’s licenses loyalty cards school and work identification cards security access cards and financial transaction cards are well suited to this technology the growing acceptance of digital photography over traditional halidebased technology offers growth opportunities for zebra in certain areas of photo printing 

zebra’s printing systems incorporate companydesigned computer hardware electrical mechanisms and software which operate the printing functions of the system and communicate with the host computer zebra’s bar code label printers operate using zebra programming language zpl â  zebra programming language ii zpl ii â  eltron programming language epl or comtec printer control language cpcl each of which is a proprietary printer driver language these languages are compatible with virtually all computer operating systems including unix msdos â and windows

zebra guarantees backward compatibility in zpl and zpl ii to allow users to replace older zebra printers with newer equipment without costly reprogramming of label design programs this compatibility also allows users to operate multiple zebra printers in different applications using standardized programs and to integrate these printers into a local area network we believe that zpl and zpl ii give us a competitive advantage by ensuring compatibility across a broad range of present and future printer products and by facilitating system upgrades and customer loyalty to zebra products some independent software vendors have written label preparation programs with zpl and zpl ii drivers specifically for zebra printers zpl and zpl ii label format programs can be run on a personal computer with ordinary word processing programs making zpl and zpl ii particularly adaptable to pcbased systems 

zebra also sells radio frequency identification rfid printerencoders that can encode data into passive rfid transponders embedded in direct thermal or thermal transfer printable labels these “smart labels” are finding growing acceptance in commercial and military supply chain management as well as many closedloop proprietary tracking applications zebramanufactured printerencoders and smart labels support both hf 1356 mhz and uhf 860960 mhz applications for rfid 

sales and marketing 

sales we sell our products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our products directly to a select number of named accounts for media and consumables we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell 

a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region andor vertical market 

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contributions to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies services and radio frequency identification rfid products in vertical markets we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete 

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs including consistent support for projects and applications are being met 

the sales function also encompasses a group that manages a small number of global alliances they direct the business development strategies for a limited number of thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

sales to international customers as a percent of net sales were as follows 

   

we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 26 different countries 

marketing marketing operations encompass marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research and channel marketing functions the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses

customers zebra has sold over 5700000 bar code label and card printers to customers in about 100 countries as of december 31 2006 

scansource inc is our most significant customer our net sales to scansource an international distributor of zebra product as a percent of total net sales were as follows 

   

no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship we assemble our products inhouse largely on a configuretoorder basis using components that have been sourced from around the world we 

have the inhouse capability to produce mechanical assemblies and design many of our own tools fixtures and test equipment often our manufacturing and test engineers coordinate the development of new products with our new product engineers and vendors this collaboration increases manufacturing efficiency by specifying and designing manufacturing processes and facilities simultaneously with product design 

we buy prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of our products critical subassemblies include printheads printed circuit board assemblies power supplies integrated circuits and stepper motors which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices purchase contracts provide for price increases only in the event of certain increases in the costs of raw materials zebra typically experiences significant variance in demand thus carries inventory and partners with key suppliers to deal with the variation 

research and development 

zebra had research and development expenditures as follows in thousands 

   

we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our efficiently manufactured products maintain high levels of reliability 

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers card personalization solutions and dye sublimation photo printers we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as impact dot matrix inkjet and laser printing similarly we consider manufacturers of card personalization systems that are based on a broad range of alternative technologies as competition 

dye sublimation the technology incorporated in our card printer is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies manufacturers also use dye sublimation technology in their digital photo printers 

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

we face competition in one or more of our product lines from many competitors including the following listed in alphabetical order altech argox canon cim cognitive solutions a subsidiary of axiohm transaction solutions colorx copal datacard datamax a unit of dover corporation evolis fargo electronics fuji godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec technologies lexmark international logickacomp magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs nisca olmec o’neil product development olympus paxar polaroid printronix sato shinko song woo electronics sony taiwan semiconductor tokyo electric company victor data systems woosim and xerox competition in the kiosk arena is vast a few of the competitors we face include custom engineering star micronics epson citizen boca systems and practical automation 

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

alternative technologies 

we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer printing will be the label and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and very high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view radio frequency identification rfid smart label printing and encoding as a complementary technology to bar coded label and receipt printing offering significant growth opportunities to zebra as the technology becomes more widely adopted 

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printer and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser impact dot matrix and laser etching while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for bar code labels and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for our targeted label and receipt printer applications we are continually monitoring and evaluating new hf and uhf rfid technologies supporting their standards development and rapidly adopting rfid into new zebra products as new markets and applications emerge 

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect several domestic and international trademarks we hold 252 united states and foreign patents and have 225 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 14 to 20 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success 

patents have become increasingly used by businesses generally as a strategic business tool and in recent years the number of patent applications and grants has risen dramatically as a result it is increasingly important that zebra takes appropriate steps to maintain and develop its own patent portfolio and reduce the risk of disputes involving third party intellectual property rights 

during 2006 we acquired patents as a result of a payment for the settlement of a lawsuit with paxar americas inc a portion of this settlement was applied to future use of patents this portion of the settlement has been recorded as intangibles and will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of the patents which range from 4 to 7 years in some cases the useful lives may be less than the patent lives see note 16 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussion of the settlement

 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results and growth prospects 

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the writeoff of certain acquisition costs 

zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products for example it acquired wherenet corp “wherenet” in january 2007 the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures an acquisition may present business issues which are new to zebra integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized moreover zebra may be unable to identify negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition which could be significant 

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 

to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

·   rapidly changing technology 

·   evolving industry standards 

·   frequent new product and service introductions 

·   evolving distribution channels 

·   changing customer demands 

future success will depend on zebra’s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

zebra competes in a highly competitive market which is likely to become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 

zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to provide 

·   technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands 

·   superior customer service 

·   high levels of quality and reliability and 

·   dependable and efficient distribution networks 

zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products any of these factors could reduce zebra’s earnings 

zebra is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the rapid increase in the complexity of its business  zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth and acquisitions this growth has caused increased complexities in the business we believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our rapid growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel the following factors could present difficulties to us

·   manufacturing an increased number of products

·   increased administrative and operational burden

·   maintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth

  

·   increased logistical problems common to complex expansive operations and

·   managing increasing international operations

if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully our operating results could be adversely affected in addition we may have difficulties managing associated increased costs which could adversely affect our operating margins 

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers 

a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in particular a key microprocessor used in zebra products has been the subject of patent litigation against the manufacturer while zebra expects the manufacturer to prevail an adverse result is such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s financial results 

infringement by zebra or zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 

third parties may claim that zebra or zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged 

zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects  

zebra may be subject to product liability claims which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers a zebra supplier has in the past provided us with defective lithiumion battery packs which were subject to a product recall zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect involving this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

the planned retirement of zebra’s chief executive officer could cause dislocations in management and changes in strategic direction during the third quarter of 2006 we announced that edward l kaplan zebra’s cofounder chairman and chief executive officer plans to retire as ceo following the recruitment of a successor ceo this current period of transition and future change in leadership could result in changes in other senior and midlevel management personnel such changes could have an adverse affect on zebra’s business in addition no assurances can be provided as to whether the successor ceo who has yet to be named will seek to change zebra’s strategies 

zebra’s equipment is subject to us and foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment which may materially adversely affect zebra’s business these regulations influence the design components or operation of such products new regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and in some jurisdictions regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent zebra from selling our products in a certain country in addition these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components in these cases zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance this could have an adverse effect on zebra’s revenues gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results in january 2003 the european union “eu” issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive requires producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive such legislation together with the directive the “weee legislation” and certain producers are to be financially responsible under the weee legislation the eu issued another directive that requires electrical and electronic equipment placed on the eu market after july 1 2006 to be free of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium above a threshold limit and brominated flame retardants eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive such legislation together with this directive the “rohs legislation” we are currently in compliance however if we do not comply with these directives we may suffer a loss of revenue be unable to sell in certain markets andor countries be subject to penalties and enforced fees andor suffer a competitive disadvantage also complying with these directives has presented additional complexities to manufacturing and operations which could result in adverse results we cannot assure you that the costs to comply with these new laws or with current and future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations expenses and financial condition added risks are associated with our international operations which may have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business 

zebra has significant overseas operations notably in the uk middle east and africa latin america and asiapacific including in particular an increasing presence in china which present added risks that may materially adversely affect the financial results and condition of zebra these risks include the following 

·   adverse changes in or uncertainty of local business laws or practices

·   inadequately managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters

·   the inability to hire and retain appropriate employees in highly competitive job markets and

·   the failure to implement and maintain adequate internal controls relating to these operations

if we are not able to effectively manage these risks they may harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks 

zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include 

·   fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales or increase costs of purchasing in foreign countries 

·   foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs quotas taxes trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 

·   political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk 

·   restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 

·   potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringing products or cause zebra to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 

·   staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 

economic factors which are outside zebra’s control could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra’s accounts receivables 

zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra’s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 

future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business zebra maintains minimal key man life insurance policies on its cofounders 

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for personnel in zebra’s industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability 

the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact the united states continues to take military action against terrorism and is currently engaged in a costly occupation of iraq these events may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere which may further contribute to economic instability any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 

zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 were up a strong 171 from the prior year reaching a record of 209903000 particularly encouraging was the strong growth in north america which had its best performance in two years up 158 from the prior year comparable period lower gross margins were the result of manufacturing variances caused partially by the lingering effects the rohs legislation which mandated that we convert our products to comply with the rohs legislation by its mid2006 deadline the “rohs conversion” variances also resulted from three facility moves during the quarter as we opened a new supplies converting operation in texas and moved into larger converting facilities in wisconsin and california all of which increased manufacturing capacity higher operating expenses resulting from the swecoin acquisition consulting expenses the costs of radio certifications advertising costs and increases to bad debt reserves reduced operating margins fourth quarter operating expenses also include a 100 reserve for an insurance receivable 

sales for the full year increased by 82 over 2005 with north american growth holding in the mid single digits until the fourth quarter international sales particularly in europe were stronger and generally more consistent throughout most of the year gross margin was down from 2005 by 31 points with first half results being affected by mix and pricing and second half by manufacturing variances which were in part the result of the rohs conversion previously mentioned the company continued to add sales and marketing staff to support its sales growth with a resulting increase in operating expenses in addition we settled a large patent litigation in the third quarter and reserved for an insurance receivable in the fourth quarter the combined impact of these two events was approximately 65935000 of expense

ongoing strength in international territories with notable growth in latin america of 144 for 2006 and europe middle east and africa emea of 129 for the full year and 22 for the fourth quarter and a material improvement in north american sales in the fourth quarter helped drive overall sales growth in 2006 for 2006 sales growth benefited from a 136 unit volume increase spread broadly across our printer product lines offset by a decline in average unit prices sales growth also benefited from strong growth in supplies sales resulting from recently implemented sales and marketing programs and additional label manufacturing capacity favorable foreign exchange movements added 31 percentage points to consolidated growth and 93 percentage points to growth in emea for the fourth quarter 

zebra is required to comply with two new european union eu directives that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive requires producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection recycling treatment and disposal of past and future covered products another directive ie the rohs legislation requires electrical and electronic equipment placed in the eu market after july 1 2006 to be free of lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium above a threshold limit and brominated flame retardants costs to comply with these new laws affected results during 2006 and may continue to impact future periods 

new printer products defined as printers released within 18 months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period as a percent of total printer product sales were as follows 

   

new product releases planned for upcoming quarters is expected by management to increase these percentages in future periods 

zebra’s international sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the dollar pound and euro which subjects our reported sales to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates we hedge a portion of anticipated eurodenominated sales to protect zebra against exchange rate movements inclusive of all hedging activities the impact of foreign exchange movements on reported sales during the fourth quarter was a gain of 5556000 the full year impact was a gain of 3606000 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a more detailed discussion of the above hedging program 

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

   

for 2006 with the exception of card printers unit volumes increased in all printer product lines with notable strength in mobile desktop and highend printers for the full year lower average selling prices across the full line of printers in addition to a mix shift toward lower priced products resulted in a 55 decrease in the average selling price of printers shipped 

gross profit 

gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages 

   

the decline in gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was due to the following

·   overhead spending and labor variances related to facility expansion in the supplies organization and

·   higher cost components required for rohs legislation compliance

full year gross profit was also affected by 

·   pricing and negative product mix in the first and second quarters and

·   negative foreign exchange comparisons in the first quarter

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are summarized in the table below in thousands except percentages 

   

for the fourth quarter of 2006 general and administrative expenses increased due to higher payroll costs of 1435000 information systems expenses of 989000 bad debt expenses of 650000 and professional services and recruiting of 964000 these increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses of 1094000 the decrease in legal expense was primarily related to the resolution of the litigation with paxar as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the full year of 2006 payroll costs increased 2350000 information systems expense increased 1718000 bad debt expense increased 944000 and professional services and recruiting increased 725000 the decrease in legal expenses was 7373000

 sales growth for 2005 reflected the effect of investments to expand our global presence and strengthen relationships with valueadded resellers and other distribution channels the success of these efforts was offset by significantly lower sales in north america to large retail accounts which purchased large quantities of primarily mobile printers the year before primarily in the preceding fourth quarter 

during 2005 we experienced a decline in sales of new printer products as a result of technical problems that delayed the introduction of various new products as well as the shifting of some new product engineering resources to environmental compliance 

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding growth rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual growth rebates have been in line with our estimates 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 

software revenue 

we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows 

·   our printers contain embedded firmware which is part of the hardware purchase we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 

·   we sell a limited amount of prepackaged or offtheshelf software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers there is no customization required to use this software and we have no postshipment obligations on the software revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 

·   we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

from time to time zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is fully met 

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2006 consisted of us government securities 187 state and municipal bonds 720 corporate bonds 16 and partnership interests 77 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale except for partnership interests described below 

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are 

excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized as of december 31 2006 zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale in addition as of december 31 2006 all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm in the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 

all investments in marketable securities except the partnership interests are classified as availableforsale securities we account for the partnership interests using the cost method until our ownership percentage reaches 5 of the total partnership portfolio value at that time we begin using the equity method to account for the partnership during 2006 we reached the 5 threshold on one of our partnership interests 

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

·   credit reviews of all new customer accounts 

·   ongoing credit evaluations of current customers 

·   credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information 

·   adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness and 

·   an active collection effort by regional credit functions reporting directly to the corporate financial officers 

we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts and notes receivable reserves varied from 06 to 28 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2006 were 3549000 or 28 of the balance due included in the accounts receivable reserve is 2307000 related to the reseller noted in the following paragraph in addition other assets include an additional reserve of 10236000 related to this reseller we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2006 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

during 2006 a zebra reseller filed for bankruptcy protection in austria at the time of the filing the reseller owed various zebra subsidiaries a total of 12065000 the entire balance due to zebra is guaranteed by condor insurance a nevis insurance company through a united kingdom insurance broker during june 2006 zebra initiated a suit in the uk courts to enforce the guarantee however during the fourth quarter we discovered that the insurance company’s financial position was such that it may not be able to pay the judgment awarded to us we have reviewed the situation and determined that a loss is probable and have therefore reserved 100 of the balance due which is now 12543000 however we are continuing to take legal action to collect the judgment against the insurance company and reduce zebra’s loss if zebra is able to recover some or all of the loss we will reverse the reserve and record a gain at that time 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

over the last three years our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 100 to 128 of gross inventory as of december 31 2006 reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were 9866000 or 121 of gross inventory we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2006 

at the end of december inventory levels are high in comparison to historical balances due to rohs conversion issues and other operational issues zebra believes that the inventory balances need to be reduced significantly and is implementing plans to do so within the next year an insufficient reduction in these inventory balances could result in increased inventory obsolescence expenses 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our last assessment during june 2006 at that time no adjustment to goodwill was necessary due to impairment 

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

·   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

·   significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business 

·   significant negative industry or economic trends 

·   significant decline in zebra’s stock price for a sustained period and 

·   significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 162170000 as of december 31 2006 

contingencies 

we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

for a discussion of all current litigation matters see note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k 

stockbased compensation 

as of december 31 2006 zebra had two stockbased compensation plans available for future grants prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for these plans using the intrinsic value method required by the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations as permitted by sfas no 123 accounting for stock based compensation accordingly we recognized no compensation cost as all options granted under these plans had grant prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

effective january 1 2006 zebra adopted sfas no 123r sharebased payment utilizing the modified retrospective approach which requires the prior period financial statements to be restated to recognize compensation costs in the amounts previously reporting in the pro forma footnote disclosures see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k for further information on the adoption and impact of sfas no 123r 

expectations during our quarterly conference call on february 14 2007 we provided net sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2007 as follows amounts in thousands except per share data 

   

the effective tax rate is expected to be 345 of income before income taxes for the first quarter of 2007

purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials 

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june 2006 the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 063 eitf 063 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation which discusses taxes imposed on and imposed concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction between a seller and its customer it requires entities to disclose if significant on an interim and annual basis for all periods presented a the accounting policy elected for these taxes and b the amounts of the taxes reflected gross as revenue in the income statement this issue will become effective for zebra during the first quarter of 2007 we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition this interpretation will become effective for zebra during the first quarter of 2007 the impact if any of this interpretation on our financial condition or results of operations has not yet been determined 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements it does not require any new fair value measurements this statement will become effective for zebra during the first quarter of 2007 we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

 

because these securities are classified as availableforsale under sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and therefore are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 15 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

 

  

equity price risk 

zebra currently employs four investment managers two of which manage portfolios of investment funds ie fund of funds these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities by policy management limits the amount of zebra’s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of 15 of the total investment portfolio with no single investment exceeding 15000000 

zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent change in the value of all equity positions held by zebra’s investment managers in thousands per share data 

 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive office and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report on form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2006 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of zebra’s internal control over financial reporting that report is included on page 40 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during 2006 we made changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been detected 

these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

the board of directors and stockholders 

of zebra technologies corporation 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria zebra technologies corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on coso criteria also in our opinion zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria

the company 

zebra technologies designs manufactures and distributes specialty printing devices that print variable information on demand at the point of issuance these devices are used worldwide by manufacturers service organizations and governments for automatic identification data collection and personal identification in applications that improve productivity deliver better customer service and provide more effective security our product range consists of direct thermal and thermal transfer label and receipt printers radio frequency identification rfid printerencoders dye sublimation card printers and digital photo printers we also sell a comprehensive range of specialty supplies consisting of selfadhesive labels thermal transfer ribbons thermal printheads batteries and other accessories including software for label design and printer network management 

  

we design our products to operate at the point of issuance to produce and dispense highquality labels plastic cards and photographs on demand the exceptional diversity of applications using our printer products for barcoding and personal identification is comprised of routing and tracking transactions processing and identification and authentication they include applications that require high levels of data accuracy and where speed and reliability are critical they also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets where improved customer service and productivity gains may be the primary reason for printing rather than a barcoding application plastic cards are used for secure reliable personal identification or access control digital photo printers are sold on an oem basis to professional photographers and for use in kiosks at retail and other locations 

  

applications for our technology span most industries and geographies they include inventory control small package delivery baggage handling automated warehousing jit justintime manufacturing employee time and attendance records file management systems hospital information systems medical specimen labeling shop floor control instore product labeling employee id cards driver’s licenses and access control systems as of december 31 2005 management estimates that zebra has sold almost 5000000 printers to users in approximately 100 countries 

  

we believe competitive forces on businesses worldwide to strengthen security reduce costs improve quality deliver better customer service and increase productivity support the adoption of bar code rfid and specialty printing applications because these technologies deliver significant and predictable economic benefits industrymandated compliance requirements for bar code labeling and rfid tagging are also important catalysts in the deployment of these systems we also believe that companies are adopting automatic identification systems that incorporate barcoding and rfid for business improvement applications many of these applications make increasing use of enterprisewide resource planning erp and other process improvement systems in manufacturing and service organizations greater emphasis on supply chain management the drive to reduce errors in healthcare and heightened concern over safety and security will lead to increased use of automatic 

  

  

identification systems still other applications are taking advantage of recent advances in wireless and handheld computing technologies 

  

concern for safety and security and personal identification contribute to demand for our card printer products this concern has heightened interest in systems that provide personal identification and access control including secure id systems for driver’s licenses employee and visitor badges national identification cards event passes club membership cards and keyless entry systems

label and receipt printers 

we produce the industry’s broadest range of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printers our printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs we believe this breadth of product is a unique and significant competitive strength because it allows zebra to satisfy the widest variety of thermal printing applications 

  

of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix management believes that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most bar code labeling applications thermal transfer printing produces dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where simplicity lightweight and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s mobile and desktop units 

  

we offer 33 bar code printer models with numerous variations including 

  

performance tabletop printers zebra produces highend printers targeted at applications requiring continuous operation in high output missioncritical settings these units provide a wide variety of optional configurations features print widths speeds and dot densities we offer four models under the xiiii plus series line list prices range from 2995 to 7495

warranties 

all zebra printing equipment is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for up to one year printheads are warranted for six months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair replacement or refund during the applicable warranty periods 

  

zebra’s technology 

our products use thermal transfer direct thermal and thermal dye sublimation technologies each technology has characteristics that provide specific benefits to the end user 

  

thermal transfer printing is used in all performance and some midrange desktop and mobile bar code label printers as well as highspeed print engines this technology creates an image by applying an electrically heated printhead to a ribbon that releases ink onto labelingticketing media the benefits of thermal transfer printing include superior image quality the ability to print on a wide variety of smoothsurfaced materials no requirement for specially coated or formulated labelingticketing media and the ability to use inks that are not viable with alternative printing technologies 

  

  

direct thermal printing is used in some midrange desktop and mobile printer products direct thermal printing creates an image by applying the heated printhead directly to specially treated paper which changes color when heated direct thermal technology is preferable where image durability is less critical and where the application does not require specialtylabeling materials such as plastics or metal foils 

  

our card printers and digital photo printers incorporate thermal dye sublimation for color printing this capability allows for the creation of personalized full color photographic quality plastic cards and highquality photographs traditional photographic processes are both more expensive and time consuming we believe that personalized card applications such as driver’s licenses loyalty cards school and work identification cards security access cards and financial transaction cards are well suited to this technology the growing acceptance of digital photography over traditional halidebased technology offers growth opportunities for zebra in certain areas of photo printing 

  

zebra’s printing systems incorporate companydesigned computer hardware electrical mechanisms and software which operate the printing functions of the system and communicate with the host computer zebra’s bar code label printers operate using zebra programming language zpl â  zebra programming language ii zpl ii â  eltron programming language epl or comtec printer control language cpcl each of which is a proprietary printer driver language these languages are compatible with virtually all computer operating systems including unix msdos â and windows

  

zebra guarantees backward compatibility in zpl and zpl ii to allow users to replace older zebra printers with newer equipment without costly reprogramming of label design programs this compatibility also allows users to operate multiple zebra printers in different applications using standardized programs and to integrate these printers into a local area network we believe that zpl and zpl ii give us a competitive advantage by ensuring compatibility across a broad range of present and future printer products and by facilitating system upgrades and customer loyalty to zebra products some independent software vendors have written label preparation programs with zpl and zpl ii drivers specifically for zebra printers zpl and zpl ii label format programs can be run on a personal computer with ordinary word processing programs making zpl and zpl ii particularly adaptable to pcbased systems 

  

zebra also sells radio frequency identification rfid printerencoders that can encode data into rfid transponders embedded in direct thermal or thermal transfer printable labels these “smart labels” are finding growing acceptance in commercial and military supply chain management as well as many closedloop proprietary tracking applications zebramanufactured printerencoders and smart labels support both hf 1356 mhz and uhf 860960 mhz applications for rfid 

  

sales and marketing 

sales we sell our products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our products directly to a select number of named accounts for media and consumables we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region andor vertical market

  

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contribution to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies service and radio frequency identification rfid expertise beginning in 2005 we have also added certifications for demonstrated expertise in vertical markets that we have targeted for future growth we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete 

  

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together 

  

  

with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs including consistent support for projects and applications are being met 

  

the sales function also encompasses a group that manages a small number of global alliances they direct the business development strategies for a limited number of thirdparty relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

  

sales to international customers as a percent of net sales were as follows 

  

   

we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 26 different countries 

  

marketing marketing operations encompass marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research and channel marketing functions the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses

  

customers zebra has sold almost 5000000 bar code label and card printers to customers in about 100 countries as of december 31 2005 

  

sales to scansource inc a distributor of automatic identification products as a percent of net sales were as follows 

  

   

no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

  

production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship we assemble our products inhouse largely on a configuretoorder basis using components that have been sourced from around the world we have the inhouse capability to produce mechanical and selected electronic assemblies and design many of our own tools fixtures and test equipment often our manufacturing and test engineers coordinate the development of new products with our new product engineers and vendors this collaboration increases manufacturing efficiency by specifying and designing manufacturing processes and facilities simultaneously with product design 

  

we buy prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of our products critical subassemblies include printheads power supplies integrated circuits and stepper motors which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices purchase contracts provide for price increases in the event of certain increases in the costs of raw materials zebra typically experiences significant variance in demand thus carries inventory and partners with key suppliers to deal with the variation 

  

  

research and development 

zebra had research and development expenditures as follows in thousands 

  

   

we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our efficiently manufactured products maintain high levels of reliability 

  

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers card personalization solutions and dye sublimation photo printers we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as impact dot matrix inkjet and laser printing similarly we consider manufacturers of card personalization systems that are based on a broad range of alternative technologies as competition 

  

dye sublimation the technology incorporated in our card printer is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies manufacturers also use dye sublimation technology in their digital photo printers 

  

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

  

we face competition in one or more of our product lines from the many competitors including the following listed in alphabetical order altech argox canon cim cognitive solutions a subsidiary of axiohm transaction solutions colorx copal datacard datamax a unit of dover corporation evolis fargo electronics fuji godex hewlettpackard hitachi intermec technologies lexmark international logickacomp magicard matica microcom mitsubishi nbs nisca olmec o’neil product development olympus paxar poloroid printronix sato shinko song woo electronics sony taiwan semiconductor tokyo electric company victor data systems woosim and xerox 

  

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

  

alternative technologies 

we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer printing will be the label and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and very high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we view radio frequency identification rfid smart label printing and encoding as a complementary technology to bar coded label and receipt printing offering significant growth opportunities to zebra as the technology becomes more widely adopted 

  

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

therefore we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printer and other means of automatic identification alternative print technologies assessed include ink jet laser impact dot matrix and laser etching while we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for bar code labels and receipts we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for our targeted label and receipt printer applications we are continually monitoring and evaluating new hf and uhf rfid technologies supporting their standards development and rapidly adopting rfid into new zebra products as new markets and applications emerge 

  

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect several domestic and international trademarks we hold 212 united states and foreign patents and have 290 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 14 to 20 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

  

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success 

  

patents have become increasingly used by businesses generally as a strategic business tool and in recent years the number of patent applications and grants has risen dramatically as a result it is increasingly important that zebra takes appropriate steps to maintain and develop its own patent portfolio and reduce the risk of disputes involving third party intellectual property rights 

  

other trademarks mentioned in this report are the property of their respective holders and include ibm a registered trademark of international business machines kodak a registered trademark of the eastman kodak unix a registered trademark of unix systems laboratories msdos and windows registered trademarks of microsoft sap a registered trademark of sap ag linux a registered trademark of linus torvalds and accelio present central a registered trademark of accelio bluetooth is a trademark owned by bluetooth sig and used by zebra under license 

  

employees as of february 25 2006 zebra employed approximately 2500 persons none of these employees is a member of a union we consider our employee relations to be very good 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results and growth prospects 

  

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the writeoff of certain acquisition costs 

zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized moreover zebra may be unable to identify negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition which could be significant 

  

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 

to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

  

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

•   rapidly changing technology 

•   evolving industry standards 

•   frequent new product and service introductions 

•   evolving distribution channels 

•   changing customer demands 

  

future success will depend on zebra’s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

  

zebra competes in a highly competitive market which is likely to become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 

zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to provide 

•   technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands 

•   superior customer service 

•   high levels of quality and reliability and 

•   dependable and efficient distribution networks 

  

zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products any of these factors could reduce zebra’s earnings 

  

zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers 

a disruption in the supply of such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

  

  

infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 

third parties may claim that zebra violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements in this regard zebra is involved in costly patent litigation with paxar americas inc and an unfavorable outcome could be materially adverse to zebra see note 16 to the financial statements included in this form 10k also as new technologies emerge such as rfid the intellectual property rights of parties in such technologies can be uncertain as a result products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties 

  

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of zebra installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects 

zebra generally has insurance for such risks and also seeks to limit such risk though product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual limitations however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect attributable to this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

  

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged 

zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

  

zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks 

zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include 

•   fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales or increase costs of purchasing in foreign countries 

•   foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs quotas taxes trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 

•   political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk 

•   restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 

•   potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringing products or cause zebra to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 

•   staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 

  

economic factors which are outside zebra’s control could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra’s accounts receivables 

zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra’s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 

  

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 

future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business zebra has no longterm employment agreements with key personnel and maintains minimal key man life insurance policies on its key employees 

  

  

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for personnel in zebra’s industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

  

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability 

the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact the united states continues to take military action against terrorism and is currently engaged in a costly occupation of iraq these events may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere which may further contribute to economic instability any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

  

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 

zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions as a result we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters in addition we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to zebra’s effective tax rate 

  

  







 item 2   properties 

  

zebra’s corporate headquarters are located in vernon hills illinois a northern suburb of chicago zebra conducts its operations from a customdesigned facility at this location which provides approximately 225000 square feet of space approximately 113000 square feet have been allocated to office and laboratory functions and 112000 square feet to manufacturing and warehousing this facility was constructed in 1989 and expanded in 1993 1995 1996 and 1999 it is owned and leased to zebra under a lease terminating on june 30 2014 by unique building corporation a corporation owned in part by edward kaplan and gerhard cless both executive officers and directors of zebra

of the shares purchased 185000 shares were purchased in satisfaction of our obligations related to the exercise of put options issued by zebra 

  

  




 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

business for the fourth quarter of 2005 reflected strength in international sales offset by minimal sales growth in north america due to a decline in mobile printer shipments to retailers we had record sales in latin america in our europe middle east and africa emea region unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements reduced sales growth in reported us dollars from a record in local currencies high growth in supplies sales also had a positive effect on the quarter’s results profitability declined as lower average unit prices warranty expenses and the negative effects of foreign exchange reduced gross margin and higher payroll expenses intellectual property work and new product development and it project costs increased operating expenses 

  

for 2005 sales growth did not meet our expectations international regions benefited from having more zebra representatives serving a broader base of customers in emerging territories in north america however the significant weakness in sales to retailers versus robust sales to this sector for 2004 contrasted with firm sales into nonretail sectors and improvements in sales of supplies delays in new product introductions also restricted sales growth for much of the year within this environment we maintained spending on key strategic activities to extend our global competitive leadership these activities include expanding geographically building stronger channel relationships and advancing our products and technology to serve a broader range of specialty printing applications zebra also incurred higher legal costs warranty expense and writeoffs in product development consequently zebra experienced declines in annual net income and earnings per share 

  

results of operations fourth quarter of 2005 versus fourth quarter of 2004 year ended december 31 2005 versus year ended december 31 2004 

  

sales 

sales by product category percent change and percent of total sales for the three months and year ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 were in thousands except percentages 

  

      

  

sales to customers by geographic region percent changes and percent of total sales for the three months and year ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 were in thousands except percentages 

  

   

   

sales growth for the fourth quarter and full year reflect the effect of investments to expand our global presence and strengthen relationships with valueadded resellers and other distribution channels the success of these efforts was offset by significantly lower sales in north america to large retail accounts which purchased large quantities of primarily mobile printers the year before primarily in the preceding fourth quarter 

  

new printer products defined as printers released within 18 months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period as a percent of total printer product sales were as follows 

  

   

the decline in sales of new printer products is the result of technical problems that delayed the introduction of various new products as well as the shifting of some new product engineering resources to environmental compliance we expect several new printer products to begin shipping early in 2006 

  

our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the dollar pound and euro this directly causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates we estimate that unfavorable foreign exchange movements of the euro and the pound versus the dollar had a negative impact of 4002000 on sales during the fourth quarter and 1929000 for the full year 

  

we currently hedge a portion of anticipated eurodenominated sales to partially protect zebra against exchange rate movements for the fourth quarter this program resulted in a gain of 875000 and a fullyear gain of 1617000 see note 15 to the financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this hedging program 

  

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

  

   

  

for all of 2005 with the exception of mobile printers unit volumes increased in all printer product lines with notable strength in midrange and desktop printers for the full year a mix toward lower priced products resulted in a 26 decrease in the average selling price of printers shipped 

  

gross profit 

gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the decline in gross profit margin for the fourth quarter is related to lower average unit prices increased warranty costs of 1411000 and unfavorable exchange rate movements of 3684000 offset by a 25 sales increase for the full year gross margin decreased largely because of lower average unit prices increased warranty costs of 3185000 primarily related to the recall of a now discontinued product unfavorable exchange rate movements of 2327000 and higher distribution costs of 1908000 which were related to the new distribution center in the netherlands 

  

selling and marketing expenses 

selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

higher selling and marketing expenses reflect ongoing investments in demandgenerating activities to build brand equity in our core product lines as well as in the emerging area of radio frequency identification rfid during the fourth quarter of 2005 selling and marketing expenses increased due to higher payroll costs of 1264000 from increased staffing as well as higher advertising and market development funding of 962000 for the full year the payroll costs increased 6836000 and advertising and market development funding increased 1976000 in addition to increases in the items mentioned above outside commissions offsite meeting and travel expenses increased during 2005 the increased staffing was primarily focused on increasing our presence in targeted geographical territories to support growth in those regions building sales and marketing teams to deliver vertical market applications and strengthening strategic alliances with complementary companies 

  

research and development costs 

the development of new products and enhancement of existing products are important to zebra’s business and growth prospects to maintain and build our product pipeline we made investments in research and development summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

quarterly product development expenses fluctuate widely depending on the status of ongoing projects we are committed to a longterm strategy of significant investment in product development for the fourth quarter of 2005 project expenses increased by 1594000 as a result of additional expenditures for new products including radio frequency identification rfid and payroll expenses increased 665000 for the full year project expenses increased 5277000 payroll costs increased 2130000 and professional services increased 744000 included in the yearto date project expenses are writeoffs of tooling and other materials related to product development in the amount of 2726000 

  

for the full year of 2005 we incurred research and development costs to reengineer our products to make them compliant with new environmental laws that go into effect in 2006 these laws include eliminating the lead content in our products these environmental compliance costs totaled 1049000 for the fourth quarter and 2882000 for the full year 

  

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are summarized in the table below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

for the fourth quarter of 2005 general and administrative expenses increased due to higher information systems expenses of 797000 and higher legal expenses of 1280000 primarily related to work on intellectual property matters including the litigation with paxar as described in note 16 to the financial statements we expect higher legal expenses to continue for subsequent quarters for the full year of 2005 general and administrative expenses increased due to higher information system expenses of 1220000 increased relocation expenses of 572000 higher payroll costs of 930000 and higher legal expenses of 6628000 primarily related to intellectual property expenses including the paxar litigation 

  

operating income 

operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands except percentages 

  

   

nonoperating income and expenses

net income 

zebra’s net income is summarized below in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

 

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met 1 we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits 2 delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain 3 the price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

 

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

growth rebates 

some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding volume rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual volume rebates have been in line with our estimates 

 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 

 

software revenue 

we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows 

•   our printers contain embedded firmware which is part of the hardware purchase we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it

•   we sell a limited amount of prepackaged or offtheshelf software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers there is no customization required to use this software and we have no postshipment obligations on the software revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped

 

 

•   we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer

 

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

 

from time to time zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is complete 

  

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2005 consisted of us government securities 121 state and municipal bonds 755 corporate bonds 40 and partnership interests 84 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

  

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized 

  

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

 

•   credit reviews of all new customer accounts

•   ongoing credit evaluations of current customers

•   credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information

•   adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness and

•   an active collection effort by regional credit functions reporting directly to the corporate financial officers

 

we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 10 to 28 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2005 were 1116000 or 10 of the balance due we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2005 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

 

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

 

over the last three years our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 104 to 131 of gross inventory as of december 31 2005 reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were 8755000 or 123 of gross inventory we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2005 

 

 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our last assessment during june 2005 at that time no adjustment to goodwill was necessary due to impairment 

  

we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

  

factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results

•   significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business

•   significant negative industry or economic trends

•   significant decline in zebra’s stock price for a sustained period and

•   significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value

  

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 137742000 as of december 31 2005 

  

contingencies 

we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

  

for a discussion of all current litigation matters see note 16 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k 

  

stockbased compensation 

as of december 31 2005 zebra had three stockbased compensation plans available for future grants we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations no stockbased compensation cost is reflected in net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant during the first quarter of 2006 we will begin expensing stock options as required under sfas no 123r sharebased payments  see notes 2 and 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form 10k for further discussion 

  

expectations during our quarterly conference call on february 8 2006 we provided net sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2006 as follows amounts in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the above expectations include an estimated 002 per diluted share for the expensing of stock options as required under sfas no 123 r sharebased payments the effective tax rate is expected to be 345 of income before income taxes 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources during the third quarter of 2005 zebra initiated a program to repurchase our own shares under this program we repurchased a total of 1866375 shares for 70421000 as a result zebra’s cash and investment balances have decreased to 544239000 as of december 31 2005 compared with 557993000 at december 31 2004 other factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2005 include note that changes discussed below include the impact of foreign currency 

  

•   operations provided a net cash increase of 92730000 primarily from net income

•   accounts receivable increased 20422000 because of higher sales and slower collections days sales outstanding increased to 568 at the end of 2005 from 506 at the end of 2004

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 were 

  

   

purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials 

  

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 

  recently issued accounting pronouncements in april 2005 the fasb changed the implementation date for sfas no 123r share based payment  which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant the provisions of this statement will now become effective for zebra during the first quarter of 2006 we plan to adopt the provisions of this statement using the modified retrospective method which requires the restatement of the financial statements of all prior years as if the fairvaluebased method of accounting for awards granted modified or settled in cash had been used in all fiscal years beginning after december 15 1994 accordingly we expect the impact on zebra’s consolidated financial statements to be consistent with the fair value disclosures included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k with additional restatements made to the balance sheet 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage paragraph 5 of arb 43 chapter 4 previously stated that these costs may be “so abnormal” that they would require treatment as current period charges this statement requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities this statement describes our current process therefore it will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and sfas no 3  which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 

  

  

the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change zebra is required to adopt this statement during the first quarter of 2006 we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and sfas no 124 accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations and apb opinion no 18 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

  

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

  

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio in thousands except per share data 

  

   

because these securities are classified as availableforsale under sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

  

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and therefore are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further discussions of hedging activities 

  

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above and in note 15 it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities in thousands except per share data 

  

   

  

equity price risk 

zebra currently employs four investment managers two of which manage portfolios of investment funds ie fund of funds these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities by policy management limits the amount of zebra’s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of 15 of the total investment portfolio with no single investment exceeding 15000000 

  

zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

  

the following table sets forth the impact of a ten percent change in the value of all equity positions held by zebra’s investment managers in thousands per share data 

  

   

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments 

  

  




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures 

not applicable 

  

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive office and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report on form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2005 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of zebra’s internal control over financial reporting that report is included on page 36 of this report on form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

during 2005 we made changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been detected 

  

these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the board of directors and stockholders of zebra technologies corporation 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria zebra technologies corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on coso criteria also in our opinion zebra technologies corporation and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the coso criteria

warranties 

all zebra printing equipment is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for up to one year printheads are warranted for six months zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair replacement or refund during the applicable warranty periods 

  

zebra’s technology 

our products use thermal transfer direct thermal and thermal dye sublimation technologies each technology has characteristics that provide specific benefits to the end user 

  

thermal transfer printing is used in all performance and some midrange desktop and portable bar code label printers as well as highspeed print engines this technology creates an image by applying an electrically heated printhead to a ribbon that releases ink onto labelingticketing media the benefits of thermal transfer printing include superior image quality the ability 

  

  

to print on a wide variety of smoothsurfaced materials no requirement for specially coated or formulated labelingticketing media and the ability to use inks that are not viable with alternative printing technologies 

  

direct thermal printing is used in some midrange desktop and portable printer products direct thermal printing creates an image by applying the heated printhead directly to specially treated paper which changes color when heated direct thermal technology is preferable where image durability is less critical and where the application does not require specialtylabeling materials such as plastics or metal foils 

  

our card printers and digital photo printers incorporate thermal dye sublimation for color printing this capability allows for the creation of personalized full color photographic quality plastic cards and highquality photographs traditional photographic processes are both more expensive and time consuming we believe that personalized card applications such as driver’s licenses loyalty cards school and work identification cards security access cards and financial transaction cards are well suited to this technology the growing acceptance of digital photography over traditional halidebased technology offers growth opportunities for zebra in certain areas of photo printing 

  

zebra’s printing systems incorporate companydesigned computer hardware electrical mechanisms and software which operate the printing functions of the system and communicate with the host computer zebra’s bar code label printers operate using zebra programming language zpl â  zebra programming language ii zpl ii â  eltron programming language epl or comtec printer control language cpcl each of which is a proprietary printer driver language these languages are compatible with virtually all computer operating systems including unix msdos â and windows

  

zebra guarantees backward compatibility in zpl and zpl ii to allow users to replace older zebra printers with newer equipment without costly reprogramming of label design programs this compatibility also allows users to operate multiple zebra printers in different applications using standardized programs and to integrate these printers into a local area network we believe that zpl and zpl ii give us a competitive advantage by ensuring compatibility across a broad range of present and future printer products and by facilitating system upgrades and customer loyalty to zebra products some independent software vendors have written label preparation programs with zpl and zpl ii drivers specifically for zebra printers zpl and zpl ii label format programs can be run on a personal computer with ordinary word processing programs making zpl and zpl ii particularly adaptable to pcbased systems 

  

users of zebra’s instantissuance card printers typically operate these printers with software programs designed and sold by independent vendors 

  

sales and marketing 

sales we sell our products primarily through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our products directly to a select number of designated accounts for media and consumables we also have a limited amount of sales directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems and application integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region andor vertical market

  

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contribution to zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies service and radio frequency identification rfid expertise we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to an extended var community all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the zebramanufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete 

  

in some instances we have designated a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together 

  

  

with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs including consistent support for projects and applications are being met 

  

sales to international customers as a percent of net sales were as follows 

  

   

we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of automatic identification applications outside north america as a result zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices or has representation in 24 different countries 

  

marketing marketing operations encompass marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing solutions marketing market research alliance management and channel marketing functions the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses

customers zebra has sold more than 4000000 bar code label and card printers to customers in about 100 countries as of december 31 2004 

  

sales to scansource inc as a percent of net sales were as follows 

  

   

no other customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales during these years 

  

  

production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship we assemble our products inhouse largely on a configuretoorder basis using components that have been sourced from around the world we have the inhouse capability to produce mechanical and electronic assemblies and design many of our own tools fixtures and test equipment often our manufacturing engineers coordinate the development of new products with our new product engineers and vendors this collaboration increases manufacturing efficiency by specifying and designing manufacturing processes and facilities simultaneously with product design 

  

we buy prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of our products critical subassemblies include printheads power supplies integrated circuits and stepper motors which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices purchase contracts provide for price increases in the event of certain increases in the costs of raw materials we typically maintain several sources for our component parts and subassemblies to reduce the risk of parts shortages or unavailability we do not currently believe that we face difficulties in obtaining an adequate supply of these materials 

  

research and development 

zebra had research and development expenditures as follows in thousands 

  

   

we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our efficiently manufactured products maintain high levels of reliability 

  

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers and card personalization solutions we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as impact dot matrix inkjet and laser printing similarly we consider manufacturers of card personalization systems that are based on a broad range of alternative technologies as competition 

  

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

  

no single competitor competes across the entire breadth of our product line significant competition however is faced in each product segment for lowcost desktop label printer products our principal competitors are argox godex cognitive solutions a subsidiary of axiohm transaction solutions tokyo electric company tec taiwan semiconductor microcom woosim and datamax a unit of dover corporation in the midrange printer market our principal competitors are datamax ubi and intermec subsidiaries of unova monarch marking systems a subsidiary of paxar sato and tec principal competition in the high end of the market derives from sato tec printronix and intermec for print engines the principal competitor is sato for mobile printers the principal competitors are monarch marking systems and o’neil product development the potential for greater competition is increasing we believe as companies view mobile printing applications to be an attractive market many of the same companies with whom we compete in thermal printing also compete with us in rfid the notable companies in this area are printronix intermec sato and monarch 

  

several competitors manufacture card personalization equipment using dye sublimation technology these competitors include nisca datacard fargo electronics colorx polaroid magicard evolis logickacomp printherm cim nbs matica song woo electronics and victor data systems 

  

  

dye sublimation the technology incorporated in our card printers is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dye sublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra including canon hewlettpackard hitachi and lexmark international in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

  

manufacturers also use dye sublimation technology in their digital photo printers companies participating in this area include sony mitsubishi copal shinko altech olmec and olympus in addition there are several other companies that participate in producing photo printers using other technologies these companies include hewlettpackard xerox polaroid and fuji 

  

the supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

  

alternative technologies 

we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer printing will be the label and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and very high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of bar code printing and automatic identification these technologies include ink jet laser impact dot matrix laser etching and rfid 

  

we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for bar code labels and receipts but we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for our targeted label and receipt printer applications to complement thermal printing technology we produce the printerencoders for printing and encoding “smart labels” which are printable labels embedded with an ultrathin radio frequency transponder information encoded in these transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader our printerencoders are targeted at emerging rfid applications where lineofsight reading or scanning a label may not be possible we view rfid as a complementary technology to barcoding offering growth opportunities to zebra as the technology becomes more widely adopted 

  

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect several domestic and international trademarks we hold 192 united states and foreign patents and have 174 united states and foreign patent applications pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 14 to 20 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

  

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success 

  

other trademarks mentioned in this report are the property of their respective holders and include ibm a registered trademark of international business machines kodak a registered trademark of the eastman kodak unix a registered trademark of unix systems laboratories msdos and windows registered trademarks of microsoft sap a registered trademark of sap ag linux a registered trademark of linus torvalds and accelio present central a registered trademark of accelio bluetooth is a trademark owned by bluetooth sig and used by zebra under license 

  

  

employees as of february 25 2005 zebra employed approximately 2300 persons none of these employees is a member of a union we consider our employee relations to be very good 

  

  










 item 2   properties 

  

zebra’s corporate headquarters are located in vernon hills illinois a northern suburb of chicago zebra conducts its operations from a customdesigned facility at this location which provides approximately 225000 square feet of space approximately 113000 square feet have been allocated to office and laboratory functions and 112000 square feet to manufacturing and warehousing this facility was constructed in 1989 and expanded in 1993 1995 1996 and 1999 it is owned and leased to zebra under a lease terminating on june 30 2014 by unique building corporation a corporation owned in part by edward kaplan and gerhard cless both executive officers and directors of zebra 

  

zebra’s major facilities as of december 31 2004 are listed below 

  

   

zebra leases various other facilities around the world which are dedicated to administrative research and sales functions the amounts related to these leases solely or in aggregate are not material to the consolidated financial statements 

  

during 1999 zebra consolidated united kingdom facilities moving distribution of its wokingham and high wycombe facilities to the preston location and transferring wokingham associates to the renovated high wycombe location the vacant wokingham facility totals 27000 square feet and has a lease that expires in october 2010 zebra is actively marketing the property seeking to sublease it through october 2010 we believe that the current rent is approximately equal to the amount we will receive from a sublease we have accrued for rent during an estimated 18month marketing period 

  

zebra announced plans to close its varades france facility in early 2004 see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of this report for further details related to the closing zebra france previously leased the varades building under a series of capital leases during 2004 we exercised our option to purchase the building under those capital leases and sold the building the resale value was slightly less than the book value of the building 

  

we also announced plans to consolidate our warwick rhode island and wakefield rhode island printer manufacturing and repair service business into our camarillo california and vernon hills illinois locations supplies manufacturing and some administrative functions will remain in rhode island we have a series of four additional twoyear option periods to continue the use of the warwick facility we have evaluated our space requirements in rhode island and intend to extend this lease and consolidate the two rhode island facilities into the warwick location during 2005 

  

since december 31 2004 we committed to lease three additional properties in vernon hills illinois we committed to lease an additional 34000 square feet of office space for three years beginning march 1 2005 in heerenveen netherlands we committed to lease approximately 95000 square feet of office and warehousing space for 20 years beginning february 15 2005 with an option to terminate the lease at each fiveyear anniversary date in chula vista california we committed to a lease of approximately 14000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space for two years beginning february 11 2005 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements which are part of this report for additional information regarding our leases 

  

  




 item 3   legal proceedings 

on april 23 2003 paxar americas inc paxar americas filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against zebra and certain of its subsidiaries paxar americas’ complaint alleges that certain of zebra’s printer products infringe one or more of eight identified paxar americas patents although not each product is accused of infringing each patent zebra has filed an answer to paxar americas’ complaint denying paxar americas’ allegations of infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses including the invalidity of paxar americas’ asserted patent claims paxar has sought to amend its original complaint to add two additional patents to the lawsuit and to expand the scope of accused products zebra has opposed paxar’s motions in this regard and the court has the issue under advisement 

  

on november 21 2003 zebra’s subsidiary zih corp zih filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against paxar corporation alleging that paxar corporation printers infringe zih’s us patent nos 5813343 and 5860753 paxar corporation answered zih’s complaint denying infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment that zih’s patentsinsuit are not infringed and are invalid andor unenforceable paxar corporation filed a motion to transfer zih’s massachusetts suit to ohio federal court and the court denied paxar’s motion 

  

on november 25 2003 paxar americas filed a complaint against zih in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents asserted by zih in its massachusetts complaint are not infringed and are invalid and unenforceable on december 17 2003 paxar americas amended its complaint to add zebra technologies corporation as a defendant in view of the massachusetts’ district court’s denial of paxar corporation’s motion to transfer to ohio zih’s corresponding patent infringement suit against paxar corporation the parties to paxar america’s ohio declaratory judgment action have agreed to transfer this case to massachusetts 

  

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain particularly in cases such as these where sophisticated factual issues must be assessed and complex technical issues must be decided as a result we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these lawsuits in the event we are unsuccessful in our defense of paxar americas’ infringement claims we could be liable for economic and other damages which could be material and we may be forced to incur ongoing licensing expenses or to change how we design manufacture and market our products the patents that zih has asserted against paxar corporation could be found invalid we have and will continue to incur substantial fees to prosecute and defend these lawsuits we are unable at this time to estimate the range of the potential liability that would result from an unsuccessful defense and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies no liability has been recorded in zebra’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2004

 item 5   market for registrant’s common stock and related stockholder matters 

  

stock information price range and common stock 

our class a common stock is traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol zbra the following table shows the high and low trade prices for each quarter in 2004 and 2003 as reported by the nasdaq stock market we adjusted all share prices for a 50 stock dividend that was distributed on august 25 2004 

  

   

   

source the nasdaq stock market 

  

at february 25 2005 the last reported price for the class a common stock was 5007 per share and there were 389 registered stockholders of record for the company’s class a common stock 

  

dividend policy 

since our initial public offering in 1991 we have not declared any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock zebra intends to retain its earnings to finance future growth and therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

  

  




 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

results of operations fourth quarter of 2004 versus fourth quarter of 2003 year ended december 31 2004 versus year ended december 31 2003 

  

sales 

sales by product category percent change and percent of total sales for the three months and year ended december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 were in thousands except percentages 

  

   

   

sales to customers by geographic region percent changes and percent of total sales for the three months and year ended december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 were in thousands except percentages 

  

   

   

we believe that our sales growth for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2004 reflects the increasing success of sales and marketing programs to improve demand for zebra products strengthen distribution channel relationships and increase the awareness of zebra products and the zebra brand in targeted markets within a favorable environment for the adoption of barcoding and specialty printing applications the growth in zebra’s business was well balanced across geographies products and channels we experienced notable sales growth in mobile printers as the mainstream adoption of wireless technology has expanded the uses of mobile printing in applications across an increasing number of vertical markets in 

  

  

addition we believe that channel programs implemented in north america supported higher sales in the region with strengthened and expanded channel partner relationships more zebra sales representatives in international territories helped increase the number of channel relationships in overseas regions and support sales growth 

  

new printer products defined as printers released within 18 months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period as a percent of total printer product sales were as follows 

  

   

our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the dollar pound and euro this directly causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates when significant currency rate fluctuations occur we review our product pricing and make appropriate changes to maintain our competitive position we estimate that favorable foreign exchange movements of the euro and the pound versus the dollar had a net positive effect of 4258000 on sales during the fourth quarter and 17626000 for the full year 

  

we currently hedge a portion of anticipated eurodenominated sales to partially protect zebra against exchange rate movements for the fourth quarter this program resulted in a loss of 1077000 and a fullyear loss of 1639000 see note 15 to the financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this hedging program 

  

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

  

   

for all of 2004 unit volumes increased in nearly all product lines and all regions with notable strength in mobile printers for the full year a favorable product mix toward higher priced products and a richer feature set within product segments on balance supported a 30 increase in the average selling price of printers shipped average unit prices were comparable between the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003 

  

gross profit 

gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the major contributors to the margin improvement were 

•   higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume representing 6518000 of the total gross profit increase for the fourth quarter of 2004 and 34010000 for the full year

•   foreign exchange rate movements which we estimate increased gross profit by 4178000 for the fourth quarter of 2004 for the full year gross profit is estimated to have been 16239000 higher due to foreign exchange rate movements

•   changes in product mix cost reductions and other items accounted for 5802000 of the margin improvement during the fourth quarter and 19833000 for the full year

  

  

selling and marketing expenses 

selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

we continue to invest heavily in demandgenerating activities to build brand equity in our core product lines as well as in the emerging area of radio frequency identification rfid during the fourth quarter of 2004 selling and marketing expenses increased due to higher payroll costs of 608000 from increased staffing as well as higher advertising and market development funding of 906000 for the full year the payroll costs increased 4052000 and advertising and market development funding increased 2475000 in addition to increases in the items mentioned above we increased outside commission consulting and legal expenses much of the additional headcount related to placing more zebra representatives in highgrowth international regions as part of our geographic expansion activities we also increased staff for better coverage of strategic accounts 

  

research and development costs 

the development of new products and enhancement of existing products are important to zebra’s business and growth prospects to maintain and build our product pipeline we made investments in research and development summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

quarterly product development expenses fluctuate widely depending on the status of ongoing projects we are committed to a longterm strategy of significant investment in product development for the fourth quarter of 2004 research and development expenses increased because of an increase in payroll costs of 587000 for the full year payroll costs increased 3253000 project expenses and consulting expenses also increased as a result of additional expenditures for new products including radio frequency identification rfid we expect to invest a larger portion of our research and development expenditures in the future on the development of rfid printerencoders 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are summarized in the table below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

for the fourth quarter of 2004 general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increased legal expenses for the full year of 2004 general and administrative expenses include 4111000 of increased legal expenses related to 

  

•   litigation with paxar

•   increased intellectual property work and

•   international expansion activity

  

in addition to legal expenses in 2004 we saw an increase in payroll costs and information system expenses 

  

exit costs 

since the fourth quarter of 2003 we announced several facility consolidation and closure activities during the fourth quarter of 2003 we announced plans to close our engineering site in varades france during january 2004 we announced plans to 

  

  

consolidate our warwick rhode island printer manufacturing and repair service business into our camarillo california and vernon hills illinois locations during december 2004 we announced plans to close and consolidate our wakefield rhode island facility into our other north american facilities primarily into the warwick rhode island facility these plans are accounted for under sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 

  

exit costs related to these consolidation and closure activities were as follows in thousands 

  

   

operating income 

operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in operating income is attributable to the following factors 

  

•   accelerated sales growth compared to 2003

•   improved gross margins resulting from better overhead utilization and

•   favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for zebra’s nondollar denominated businesses

  

as a result of these factors operating income increased by 243 percentage points more than the rate of sales growth during the fourth quarter and 120 percentage points more than the rate of sales growth for the full year 

  

nonoperating income and expenses 

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

  

   

during the fourth quarter of 2004 zebra earned 2949000 on average cash and marketable securities balances of 540517000 which equates to an annualized 22 rate of return for the full year investment income was 10628000 or 21 of average cash and marketable securities balances of 502921000 

  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 343 compared with 312 for the same quarter last year the 2003 rate is lower because of the resolution of our longstanding dispute with the illinois department of revenue and the related decrease to income tax expense of 1342000 during that quarter for 2004 the effective income tax rate was 346 versus 326 for 2003 for the reason noted above 

  

  

net income 

zebra’s net income is summarized below in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

  

comparison of years ended december 31 2003 and 2002   

sales 

sales by product category related percent changes and percent of total sales for 2003 and 2002 were as follows 

   

sales to customers by geographic region related percent changes and percent of total sales for 2003 and 2002 were as follows 

  

   

higher sales growth in 2003 was a result of additional geographic expansion in asia latin america and europe in addition we placed a greater emphasis on highgrowth vertical markets and added marketing resources to support emerging radio frequency identification rfid opportunities new printer products accounted for 233 of printer sales in 2003 compared with 222 in 2002 

  

our international sales were benefited in 2003 by favorable exchange rates for the full year of 2003 sales translated into dollars increased by 24783000 or 52 percentage points compared to translating the same sales using exchange rates that prevailed in 2002 to remain competitive in markets experiencing currency strength against the dollar we adjusted our pricing resulting in a 12610000 reduction in sales the net sales increase related to exchange rate fluctuations and offsetting pricing adjustments was 12173000 for 2003 

  

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

  

   

for 2003 the increase in printer volume was due to high sales of desktop and mobile printers as a result of more companies adopting technology for wireless networks average unit selling price increases were related to increases in the average unit selling prices of midrange desktop printers portable printers and print engines and is offset by higher volumes of the lower priced mobile printers 

  

  

gross profit 

gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

gross profit increased due to 

•   higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume representing 17417000 of the total gross profit increase for 2003 

•   foreign exchange rate movements and related pricing adjustments which we estimate increased gross profit by 10900000 for 2003 due to foreign exchange movements net of related pricing adjustments

•   cost reductions  which contributed 9371000 to the margin improvement during 2003

  

selling and marketing expenses 

selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in selling and marketing expenses for 2003 resulted from our investments in demandgenerating activities with higher advertising publications and market research travel demonstration units and market development fund expenses 

  

research and development costs 

research and development costs are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

for 2003 research and development expenses increased primarily due to increases in project expenses which were higher because of reductions related to thirdparty funded engineering costs that had occurred in 2002 but did not reoccur in 2003 in addition payroll and benefits were up 1752000 over 2002 but consulting expenses were down 945000 

  

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

  

for 2003 general and administrative expenses include 596000 of increased legal expenses related to 

•   litigation with paxar

•   increased intellectual property work

•   international activity and

•   general contract review

  

in addition to legal expenses in 2003 we saw an increase in director and officer liability insurance and administrative personnel costs a portion of these costs resulted from new compliance requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and related regulations offsetting these increases was a decline in consulting expenses 

  

costs related to terminated acquisitions and merger costs 

during 2002 we terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which zebra would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock including associated rights to purchase preferred stock of fargo electronics inc for 725 per share in cash during the time that the tender offer was active we incurred legal accounting and other expenses related to the proposed acquisition that would have been treated as part of the purchase price had the tender offer been completed we expensed 3300000 of these costs at the cancellation of the tender offer 

  

exit costs 

during the fourth quarter of 2003 we announced a plan to close our engineering site in varades france this plan is being accounted for under sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities included in operating expenses for 2003 are exit costs consisting of primarily severance in the amount of 1232000 

  

operating income 

operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in operating income is attributable to the following factors 

  

•   accelerated sales growth compared to 2002

•   improved gross margins resulting from increased overhead utilization

•   favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for zebra’s nondollar denominated business and

•   cost controls that held operating expense growth slightly below the rate of sales growth

  

as a result of these actions operating income increased by 141 percentage points more than the rate of sales growth during 2002 

  

nonoperating income and expenses 

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

  

   

for 2003 investment income decreased because 2002 results included a 1953000 pretax realized gain on the sale of 585000 shares of common stock of fargo electronics 

  

  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for 2003 was 326 versus 354 in 2002 the rate for 2003 is less than the 35 zebra had previously recorded because of the following nonrecurring tax items during the year 

  

•   during the fourth quarter of 2003 we settled our longstanding dispute with the illinois department of revenue and recorded a decrease to income tax expense for 1342000 since our reserves for this tax dispute exceeded the amount of the settlement

•   during the third quarter of 2003 we eliminated a reserve related to research and experimentation tax credits that were claimed and recorded a reduction to income tax expense of 1947000

  

excluding these two tax adjustments our effective tax rate would have been 35 for 2003 

  

net income 

zebra’s net income is summarized below in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

  

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

zebra recognizes sales from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title which are generally the same other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

  

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns historically our product returns have not been significant however if a significant issue should arise it could have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

volume rebates 

some of our customers are offered incentive rebates based on the volume of product they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding volume rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual volume rebates have been in line with our estimates 

  

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 

  

software revenue 

we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows 

  

 

•   our printers contain embedded firmware which is part of the hardware purchase we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it

•   we sell a limited amount of prepackaged or offtheshelf software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers there is no customization required to use this software and we have no postshipment obligations on the software revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped

•   we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer

  

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

  

from time to time zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type this bundle of products might include printers current or future supplies and services when this type of transaction occurs we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is complete 

  

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2004 consisted of us government securities 215 state and municipal bonds 650 corporate bonds 78 and partnership interests 57 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

  

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized 

  

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

  

•   credit reviews of all new customer accounts

•   ongoing credit evaluations of current customers

•   credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information

•   adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness and

•   an active collection effort by regional credit functions reporting directly to the corporate financial officers

 

we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 16 to 28 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2004 were 1561000 or 16 of the balance due we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2004 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

  

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

  

a significant increase in the demand for zebra’s products could result in a shortterm increase in the cost of inventory purchases however this would be offset by improved overhead utilization resulting from the additional demand a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 

 

 

our forecasted product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated if inventories were determined to be overvalued we would recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 

 

over the last three years our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 104 to 131 of gross inventory as of december 31 2004 reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were 7338000 or 109 of gross inventory we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december 31 2004 

  

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our last assessment during june 2004 

  

we evaluate the impairment of other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

  

factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results

•   significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business

•   significant negative industry or economic trends

•   significant decline in zebra’s stock price for a sustained period and

•   significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value

  

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 114593000 as of december 31 2004 

  

contingencies 

we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

  

on april 23 2003 paxar americas inc paxar americas filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against zebra and certain of its subsidiaries paxar americas’ complaint alleges that certain of zebra’s printer products infringe one or more of eight identified paxar americas patents although not each product is accused of infringing each patent zebra has filed an answer to paxar americas’ complaint denying paxar americas’ allegations of infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses including the invalidity of paxar americas’ asserted patent claims paxar has sought to amend its original complaint to add two additional patents to the lawsuit and to expand the scope of accused products zebra has opposed paxar’s motions in this regard and the court has the issue under advisement 

  

on november 21 2003 zebra’s subsidiary zih corp zih filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against paxar corporation alleging that paxar corporation printers infringe zih’s us patent nos 5813343 and 5860753 paxar corporation answered zih’s complaint denying infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment that zih’s patentsinsuit are not infringed and are invalid andor unenforceable paxar corporation filed a motion to transfer zih’s massachusetts suit to ohio federal court and the court denied paxar’s motion 

  

on november 25 2003 paxar americas filed a complaint against zih in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents asserted by zih in its massachusetts complaint are not infringed and are invalid and unenforceable on december 17 2003 paxar americas amended its complaint to add zebra technologies corporation as a defendant in view of the massachusetts’ district court’s denial of paxar corporation’s motion to transfer to ohio zih’s corresponding patent infringement suit against paxar corporation the parties to paxar america’s ohio declaratory judgment action have agreed to transfer this case to massachusetts 

  

  

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain particularly in cases such as these where sophisticated factual issues must be assessed and complex technical issues must be decided as a result we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these lawsuits in the event we are unsuccessful in our defense of paxar americas’ infringement claims we could be liable for economic and other damages which could be material and we may be forced to incur ongoing licensing expenses or to change how we design manufacture and market our products the patents that zih has asserted against paxar corporation could be found invalid we have and will continue to incur substantial fees to prosecute and defend these lawsuits we are unable at this time to estimate the range of the potential liability that would result from an unsuccessful defense and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies no liability has been recorded in zebra’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2004 

  

stockbased compensation 

as of december 31 2004 zebra had three stockbased compensation plans available for future grants we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations no stockbased compensation cost is reflected in net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation to stockbased compensation in thousands except per share amounts

  

   

expectations during our quarterly conference call on february 9 2005 we provided net sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2005 as follows amounts in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the effective tax rate is expected to be 3475 of income before income taxes 

  

liquidity and capital resources zebra continued to generate cash well in excess of its operating requirements as a result zebra’s cash and investment balances have continually grown over time as of december 31 2004 zebra had 557993000 in cash cash equivalents investments and marketable securities compared with 447848000 at december 31 2003 factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2004 include note that changes discussed below include the impact of foreign currency 

  

•   operations provided a net cash increase of 111256000 primarily from net income

  

  

•   accounts receivable increased 11491000 because of higher sales

•   inventories increased 15456000 compared to the same period a year ago inventory turns decreased to 57 from 68

•   other assets increased 11492000 primarily due to the purchase of life insurance policies on key executives with guaranteed returns which due to the nature of these investments are classified as longterm

•   accounts payable increased by 6420000 in relation to the increase in inventory

•   accrued expenses increased 1974000

•   taxes payable increased 3720000 due to increased profits

•   purchases of property and equipment totaled 16243000

•   net purchases of investments and marketable securities totaled 106428000

•   stock option exercises and purchases under the stock purchase plan contributed 15531000

  

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 were 

  

   

purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials 

  

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements in march 2004 the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue no 031 eitf 031 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments additionally eitf 031 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired in september 2004 the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf 031 however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june 15 2004 we will evaluate the impact of eitf 031 once final guidance is issued see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for added disclosures 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage paragraph 5 of arb 43 chapter 4 previously stated that these costs may be “so abnormal” that they would require treatment as current period charges this statement requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities this statement describes our current process therefore it will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r revised 2004 share based payment  which is a revision of sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance sfas no 123 r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through sharebased payment transactions it requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the provisions of this statement become effective for zebra during the third quarter of 2005 we expect the impact on zebra’s consolidated financial statements to be consistent with the fair value disclosures included in our critical accounting policies and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp fas 1091 application of fasb no 109 accounting foriincome taxe to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 fsp fas no 1091 clarifies sfas no 109’s guidance that applies to the new tax deduction for qualified domestic production activities fsp no 1091 became effective upon issuance and we believe that this pronouncement will have an insignificant impact on our effective tax rate in 2005 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp fas 1092 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004 fsp fas 1092 provides implementation guidance related to the repatriation provision of the american jobs creation act of 2004 we have completed our assessment of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that might be repatriated at this time we do not expect to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as dividends to take advantage of this tax credit 

  

risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results and growth prospects 

  

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the writeoff of certain acquisition costs 

zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized moreover zebra may be unable to identify negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition which could be significant 

  

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 

to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

  

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

•   rapidly changing technology 

•   evolving industry standards 

•   frequent new product and service introductions 

•   evolving distribution channels 

•   changing customer demands 

  

future success will depend on zebra’s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

  

zebra competes in a highly competitive market which is likely to become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 

zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to provide 

•   technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands 

•   superior customer service 

•   high levels of quality and reliability and 

•   dependable and efficient distribution networks 

  

zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make 

  

  

strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products any of these factors could reduce zebra’s earnings 

  

zebra may incur liabilities as a result of zebra installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects 

zebra generally has insurance for such risks and also seeks to limit such risk though product design manufacturing quality control processes product testing and contractual limitations however due to the large and growing size of zebra’s installed printer base a design or manufacturing defect attributable to this large installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on zebra’s financial results 

  

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged 

zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

  

infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 

third parties may claim that zebra violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel if such claims are successful they could result in costly judgments or settlements 

  

zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks 

zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include 

•   fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales or increase costs of purchasing in foreign countries 

•   foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs quotas taxes trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 

•   political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk 

•   restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 

•   potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries such as china may limit recourse against infringing products or cause zebra to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 

•   staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 

•   zebra may not be able to control international distributors working on its behalf 

  

economic factors which are outside zebra’s control could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra’s accounts receivables 

zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra’s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 

  

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 

future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business zebra has no longterm employment agreements with key personnel and maintains minimal key man life insurance policies on its key employees 

  

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for personnel in zebra’s industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

  

  

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability 

the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact the united states continues to take military action against terrorism and is currently engaged in a costly occupation of iraq these events may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere which may further contribute to economic instability any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

  

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 

zebra operates in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and worldwide local tax authorities may challenge zebra’s tax positions from time to time adverse outcomes in these situations may exceed zebra’s reserves for tax payments and may increase zebra’s effective tax rate 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

  

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

  

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio as of december 31 2004 in thousands except per share data 

  

   

because these securities are classified as availableforsale under sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 

  

foreign exchange risk 

we conduct business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and therefore are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments 

  

hedging of net assets 

we use forward contracts and options to manage exposure related to our pound and euro denominated net assets we record gains and losses on these contracts and options in income each quarter along with the translation gains and losses related to our net euro asset position which would ordinarily offset each other summary financial information related to these activities follows in thousands 

  

   

   

  

hedging of anticipated sales 

during the second quarter of 2003 we began a program to manage the exchange rate risk of anticipated euro denominated sales using forward contracts and designated these contracts as cash flow hedges gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income until the contracts are settled and the hedged sales are realized at which time the deferred gains or losses will be reported as an increase or decrease to sales summary financial information related to the cash flow hedges of future revenues follows in thousands except percentages 

  

   

   

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities as of december 31 2004 in thousands except per share data 

  

   

equity price risk 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments 

  

zebra currently employs four investment managers two of which manage portfolios of investment funds ie fund of funds these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities each investment manager’s portfolio is designed to be market neutral although an individual fund within a portfolio may be exposed to market risk by policy management limits the amount of zebra’s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of 15 of the total investment portfolio with no single investment exceeding 15000000 

  

zebra utilizes a valueatrisk var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our disclosure committee and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on that evaluation our chief executive office and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that i the information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report on form 10k was recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework based on this assessment and those criteria our management believes that as of december 31 2004 our internal control over financial reporting is effective our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of zebra’s internal control over financial reporting that report is included on page 38 of this report on form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

during 2004 we made numerous changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of our controls however none of these changes has materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within zebra have been detected 

  

these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm   

the board of directors and stockholders 

of zebra technologies corporation

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitation internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso

bar code label and receipt printers 

we produce the industry’s broadest range of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal bar code label printers our printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs we believe this breadth of product is a unique and significant competitive strength because it allows zebra to satisfy the widest variety of thermal printing applications 

  

management believes that of the major printing technologies which include ink jet laser and impact dot matrix direct thermal and thermal transfer are best suited for most bar code labeling applications thermal transfer printing produces dark solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable bar codes these images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object this capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors zebra serves direct thermal printing is best suited where simplicity light weight and cost are important factors in the application accordingly this technology is found principally in zebra’s wireless and desktop units 

  

we offer 33 bar code printer models with numerous variations at december 31 2003 our main printer product offerings were as follows 

  

performance tabletop printers zebra produces highend printers targeted at applications requiring continuous operation in high output missioncritical settings these units provide a wide variety of optional configurations features print widths speeds and dot densities we offer six models under the xiiii plus series line list prices range from 2995 to 7495

  

 

rfid printerencoders zebra also manufactures and markets a growing line of printerencoders used for radio frequency identification rfid applications these units are used to print and encode “smart labels” in a single pass smart labels are printable labels embedded with an ultrathin radio frequency transponder information encoded in these transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader as of december 31 2003 we offered the r140 and r402 printerencoders which have list prices of 5695 for the r140 and 1695 for the r402 we also have several other printerencoder models under development these units are targeted at emerging supply chain applications in retail and government among others

  

midrange tabletop printers we offer five printer models designed for less demanding applications these units have fewer option configurations and features for a commensurate lower price products in this category consist of the zebra stripe â  s and z series as well as the tlp 2746e printers list prices range from 1495 to 2295

  

desktop printers applications with low volume suit zebra’s desktop printers we currently offer six desktop models consisting of the ht146 lptlp 2844 lptlp 2844z tlp 3842 tlp 3844z and lptlp 2824 printers list prices range from 495 to 995

print engines zebra’s 170pax3 and 110pax3 print engines are sold to manufacturers of highspeed automatic label applicator systems

  

in addition to their use in ondemand automatic identification applications our bar code label printers can also be used for onsite batch production of custom bar code labels and other graphics this capability results in shorter lead times reduced inventory and more flexibility than can be provided with traditional offsite printing 

  

card imaging printers 

zebra makes ten card printer models for printing national identity cards driver’s licenses employee identification badges smart cards ondemand access control cards and customer loyalty cards these cards can typically be created in seconds for under one dollar each users can select from a number of printer options including monochrome and color printing single and twosided printing lamination and magnetic stripe and smart card encoding bar codes smart chips and magnetic stripe encoding can be used to record such personal data as health records financial transactions security access codes and vital statistics we offer six “p” series and four “i” series card imaging printers printers in the “i” series incorporate features that automatically optimize printer settings for a given ribbon the list prices for all of zebra’s card imaging printers range from 1695 to 9995 

  

photo printers 

with the november 2003 acquisition of atlantek we began producing digital photo printers we currently manufacture a highspeed thermal printer jointly developed with and marketed by eastman kodak as the kodak ml500 professional photo printer the ml500 can print 8x10 photographs in about 13 seconds and can produce up to 270 8x10 prints per hour it is designed for professional photographers for event and instudio printing digital photo printing is an extension of our core thermal printing technology 

  

supplies 

supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels smart labels and tags plastic cards card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons zebra promotes the use of genuine zebra brand supplies with its equipment 

  

zebra fully supports its printers resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality high performance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs supplies are chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform in the case of bar code labeling solutions supplies also include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed to maximize printer performance and meet the most demanding end user performance criteria factors such as adhesion resistance to scratches smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials the use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade print speed and print quality 

  

 

software 

label design and integration software is specifically designed to optimize the performance of zebra bar code label printers known as barone â  this software provides the capability to design and integrate sophisticated labels from standalone or legacy applications through a powerful easytouse windows â interface

  

our goal is to provide software that enables high levels of connectivity to all major computer network and software systems these networks include ethernet 80211 and bluetooth™ wireless systems and various ibm â systems software systems include sap â and other erp systems warehouse management systems wms windows unix â and linux â  under an agreement with accelio corporation a provider of electronic forms workflow and output management software applications zebra offers barone with accelio present central â formerly jetform central™ this software package enables zebra printers to receive output directly from many of the popular software packages on the market including the increasingly used erp software without the need to write costly software interfaces zebra also offers a barone for sapr3 which enables users of the sapr3 erp system to print directly to zebra printers without the need for middleware to expand the global applications for its software and printers we are developing multilingual capabilities in its software and user interfaces

  

the goal of improving connectivity has also led to the development and introduction of zebralink this multipurpose software tool gives users the ability to set up and control zebra printers remotely using webenabled devices it also enables zebra printers to provide realtime printer error and status notification via email to a wired or wireless device in addition zebralink’s programming language zbi can be used to control and interpret incoming text and data streams zbi gives users the ability to configure zebra printers to interpret various nonzebra printer based languages as well as to set up operations in which a bar code label printer is needed and eliminate a computer hookup 

  

maintenance services 

for bar code label and receipt printers we currently provide service at depot repair centers at its vernon hills illinois camarillo california warwick rhode island preston uk and singapore facilities zebra authorized service providers zasp also provide repair services for most zebra products at their locations in addition ibm optimal systems services and national service center nsc provide onsite repair services in the united states we share the revenue for onsite service contracts sold by ibm optimal and nsc for zebra printing systems installed in the united states and with ibm in europe outside of the united states zebra’s resellers in each country may provide maintenance service either directly as zasps or through independent service agents zebra also provides service and technical support assistance from inhouse support personnel located in the united states the united kingdom and singapore who are available by telephone hotline five days a week during regular local business hours also for most zebra products zebra provides interactive technical support via the internet which can be accessed through zebra’s web site wwwzebracom 24 hours a day seven days a week 

  

in january 2004 we initiated activities to substantially consolidate our north american depot repair services for bar code printers in vernon hills illinois over the next 1218 months repair services currently performed in camarillo california and warwick rhode island will transfer to vernon hills we are taking this action to improve customer service by providing one service point of contact for all bar code printers see note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for details on the transition costs 

  

the card printer depot repair facilities are located in camarillo california preston uk and wakefield rhode island ibm performs onsite repair services in the united states and europe card printer users can receive technical support assistance from inhouse support personnel located in the united states the united kingdom singapore and france who are available by telephone during regular business hours in addition online support for card printers can be accessed through the web site wwweltroncardscom 24 hours a day seven days a week 

  

warranties 

all zebra printing equipment is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for up to one year zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months whichever ends first defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair replacement or refund during the applicable warranty periods 

  

zebra’s technology 

our products use thermal transfer direct thermal and thermal dye sublimation technologies each technology has characteristics that provide specific benefits to the end user 

  

 

thermal transfer printing is used in all performance and some midrange desktop and portable bar code label printers as well as highspeed print engines this technology creates an image by applying an electrically heated printhead to a ribbon that releases ink onto labelingticketing media the benefits of thermal transfer printing include superior image quality the ability to print on a wide variety of smoothsurfaced materials no requirement for specially coated or otherwise specially formulated labelingticketing media and the ability to use inks that are not viable with alternative printing technologies 

  

direct thermal printing is used in some midrange desktop and portable printer products direct thermal printing creates an image by applying the heated printhead directly to specially treated paper which changes color when heated direct thermal technology is preferable where image durability is less critical and where the application does not require specialtylabeling materials such as plastics or metal foils 

  

our card imaging printers and digital photo printers incorporate thermal dye sublimation for color printing this capability allows for the creation of personalized full color photographic quality plastic cards and highquality photographs traditional photographic processes are both more expensive and time consuming we believe that personalized card applications such as driver’s licenses loyalty cards school and work identification cards security access cards and financial transaction cards are well suited to this technology the growing acceptance of digital photography over traditional halidebased technology offers growth opportunities for zebra in certain areas of photo printing 

  

zebra’s printing systems incorporate companydesigned computer hardware electrical mechanisms and software which operate the printing functions of the system and communicate with the host computer zebra’s bar code label printers operate using zebra programming language zpl â  zebra programming language ii zpl ii â  eltron programming language epl or comtec printer control language cpcl each of which is a proprietary printer driver language these languages are compatible with virtually all computer operating systems including unix msdos â and windows

  

zebra guarantees backward compatibility in zpl and zpl ii to allow users to replace older zebra printers with newer equipment without costly reprogramming of label design programs this compatibility also allows users to operate multiple zebra printers in different applications using standardized programs and to integrate these printers into a local area network we believe that zpl and zpl ii give us a competitive advantage by ensuring compatibility across a broad range of present and future printer products and by facilitating system upgrades and customer loyalty to zebra products some independent software vendors have written label preparation programs with zpl and zpl ii drivers specifically for zebra printers zpl and zpl ii label format programs can be run on a personal computer with ordinary word processing programs making zpl and zpl ii particularly adaptable to pcbased systems 

  

users of zebra’s instantissuance card imaging printers typically operate these printers with software programs designed and sold by independent vendors 

  

sales and marketing 

sales we sell our products primarily indirectly through distributors valueadded resellers vars and original equipment manufacturers oems we also sell our products directly to a select number of designated accounts for supplies we also sell directly to end users through the internet and telesales operations distributors and vars purchase stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for enduser applications using their systems integration expertise because these sales channels provide specific software configuration installation integration and support services required by end users within various market segments these relationships allow zebra to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries zebra experiences a minor amount of seasonality in sales depending on the geographic region andor vertical market

  

we functionally classify our direct vars as premier partners advanced partners or associate partners depending on their business competencies depth and breadth of their sales teams customer support capabilities contribution to zebra’s strategic goals and commitment to zebra in addition we offer vars the opportunity to earn certifications for mobilewireless printers supplies and service we also sell through distributors which in turn sell to smaller vars all vars as well as oems and systems integrators provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners accessories applications software and systems integration expertise and in the case of some oems resell the products under their own brands as part of their own product offering we believe that the breadth of this indirect channel network both in terms of variety and geographic scope enhances our ability to compete 

  

 

in some instances we may designate a customer as a strategic account when purchases of zebra products reach specified levels and support requirements for the account become highly customized zebra sales personnel either alone or together with our partners manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs including consistent support for projects and applications are being met 

  

sales to international customers comprised 455 of net sales in 2003 432 of net sales in 2002 and 400 of net sales in 2001 we believe that international sales have the longterm potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of bar code systems outside the united states as a result the company has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operate facilities and sales offices or has representation in 18 different countries 

  

marketing marketing operations encompass marketing communications product marketing vertical marketing market research alliance management and channel marketing functions the product marketing group identifies evaluates and recommends new product opportunities and manages product introductions positioning and demand creation product marketing also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses

  

the vertical marketing group works with reselling and nonreselling partners to develop and promote application solutions that have significant zebra content the vertical marketing group also focuses on industry trends participates in business development activities at the technical and applications standards levels and provides subject matter expertise 

  

alliance management directs a limited number of third party relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets andor specific applications 

  

the marketing communications group operates as an internal advertising event marketing promotion internet marketing and public relations resource this group working with advertising agencies and contractors creates advertisements and brochures manages trade show exhibits maintains zebra’s web sites and places articles highlighting zebra and applications of its products in the trade industry business and consumer media 

  

the market research group is a strategic planning researchoriented group that focuses on market definition and analysis of our relative competitive strengths and weaknesses this group identifies and analyzes market opportunities for current planned and potential products and gathers and analyzes competitive and market information

customers zebra has sold more than 3000000 bar code label and card imaging printers to customers in about 100 countries as of december 31 2003 

  

sales to scansource inc accounted for 138 of net sales in 2003 and 136 in 2002 no customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales in 2001 

  

production and manufacturing 

we design our products to optimize product performance quality reliability durability and versatility these designs combine costefficient materials sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship we assemble our products inhouse largely on a configuretoorder basis using components that have been sourced from around the world we have the inhouse capability to produce mechanical and electronic assemblies and design many of our own tools fixtures and test equipment often our manufacturing engineers coordinate the development of new products with our new product engineers and vendors this collaboration increases manufacturing efficiency by specifying and designing manufacturing processes and facilities simultaneously with product design 

  

we buy prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of our products critical subassemblies include printheads power supplies integrated circuits and stepper motors which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices purchase contracts provide for price increases in the event of certain increases in the costs of 

  

 

raw materials we maintain several sources for our component parts and subassemblies to reduce the risk of parts shortages or unavailability we do not currently believe that we face difficulties in obtaining an adequate supply of these materials 

  

research and development 

zebra had research and development expenditures of 31759000 in 2003 29210000 in 2002 and 28184000 in 2001 these expenditures amounted to 59 61 and 63 of net sales for the corresponding periods we devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our products maintain high levels of reliability and efficient manufacturing 

  

competition 

many companies are engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers and card personalization solutions we consider our direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of ondemand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems and supplies we also compete however with companies engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies such as impact dot matrix inkjet and laser printing similarly we consider manufacturers of card personalization systems that are based on a broad range of alternative technologies as competition 

  

our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors these factors include the reliability quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products hardware and software innovations and specifications breadth of product offerings information systems connectivity price level of technical support supplies and applications support offered by the manufacturer available distribution channels and financial resources to support new product design and innovation we believe that zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors 

  

no single competitor competes across the entire breadth of our product line significant competition however is faced in each product segment for lowcost desktop label printer products our principal competitors are argox godex cognitive solutions a subsidiary of axiohm transaction solutions tokyo electric company tec taiwan semiconductor microcom woosim and datamax in the midrange printer market our principal competitors are datamax ubi and intermec subsidiaries of unova monarch marking systems a subsidiary of paxar sato and tec principal competition in the high end of the market derives from sato tec printronix and intermec for print engines the principal competitor is sato for portable printers the principal competitors are monarch marking systems and o’neil product development the potential for greater competition is increasing we believe as companies view mobile printing applications to be an attractive market 

  

several competitors manufacture card personalization equipment using dye sublimation technology these competitors include nisca datacard fargo electronics colorx polaroid magicard evolis logickacomp printherm cim nbs matica song woo electronics and victor data systems 

  

dyesublimation the technology incorporated in our card printers is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards we also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies which include inkjet thermal transfer embossing filmbased systems encoders laser engraving and largescale dyesublimation printers these card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies many of which are substantially larger than zebra including canon hewlettpackard hitachi and lexmark international in addition service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies 

  

manufacturers also use dyesublimation technology in their digital photo printers companies participating in this area include sony mitsubishi copal shinko altech olmec and olympus in addition there are several other companies that participate in producing photo printers using other technologies these companies include hewlettpackard xerox polaroid and fuji 

  

competition in the supplies business is diluted with numerous competitors of various sizes depending on the geographic area 

  

alternative technologies 

we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer printing will be the label and receipt printer technology of choice in zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print highresolution durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and very high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies we continually assess competitive and complementary 

  

 

methods of bar code printing and automatic identification these technologies include ink jet laser impact dot matrix laser etching and rfid 

  

we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for bar code labels and receipts but we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for our targeted label and receipt printer applications to complement thermal printing technology we produce the printerencoders for printing and encoding “smart labels” which are printable labels embedded with an ultrathin radio frequency transponder information encoded in these transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader our printerencoders are targeted at emerging rfid applications where lineofsight reading or scanning a label may not be possible we view rfid as a complementary technology to barcoding offering growth opportunities to zebra as the technology becomes more widely adopted 

  

if other technologies were to evolve or become available to zebra it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products alternatively if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors zebra’s products may become obsolete this obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on zebra’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

intellectual property rights 

zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets patents employee and third party nondisclosure agreements copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products we have and actively protect several domestic and international trademarks we hold 90 patents and have 46 patents pending pertaining to products the duration of these patents ranges from 14 to 20 years the expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business 

  

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary moreover the laws of some countries do not afford zebra the same protection to proprietary rights as do united states laws there can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate while zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages we do not believe that the legal protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success

 item 2   properties 

  

zebra’s corporate headquarters are located in vernon hills illinois a northern suburb of chicago zebra conducts its operations from a customdesigned facility at this location which provides approximately 225000 square feet of space approximately 113000 square feet have been allocated to office and laboratory functions and 112000 square feet to manufacturing and warehousing this facility was constructed in 1989 and expanded in 1993 1995 1996 and 1999 it is owned and leased to zebra under a lease terminating on june 30 2014 by unique building corporation a corporation owned in part by edward kaplan and gerhard cless both executive officers and directors of zebra 

  

zebra’s major facilities as of december 31 2003 are listed below 

  

   

zebra leases various facilities around the world which are dedicated to administrative research and sales functions the amounts related to these leases solely or in aggregate are not material to the consolidated financial statements 

  

during 1999 zebra consolidated united kingdom facilities moving distribution of its wokingham and high wycombe facilities to the preston location and transferring wokingham associates to the renovated high wycombe location the vacant wokingham facility totals 27000 square feet and has a lease that expires in october 2010 zebra is actively marketing the property seeking to sublease it through october 2010 we believe that the current rent is approximately equal to the amount we will receive from a sublease we have accrued for rent during an estimated 12month marketing period this building was previously subleased through december 31 2003 

  

zebra has announced plans to close its varades france facility in early 2004 see note 18 for further details related to the closing zebra france leases the varades building under a series of capital leases it is our intention to exercise our option to purchase the building under those capital leases and then subsequently sell the building we believe that the resale value will be approximately equal to the book value of the building 

  

we also announced plans to consolidate our warwick rhode island printer manufacturing and repair service business into our camarillo california and vernon hills illinois locations the completion of that consolidation activity will coincide with the expiration of the current lease term in april 2005 at that time zebra has a series of four additional twoyear option periods to continue the use of that facility we will be evaluating our space requirements in rhode island and determining the appropriate course of action during 2004 this action might include extending the current lease or consolidating operations with the wakefield rhode island facility in a new location 

  

 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

on april 23 2003 paxar americas inc paxar americas filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against zebra and certain of its subsidiaries paxar americas’ complaint alleges that certain of zebra’s printer products infringe one or more of eight identified paxar americas patents although not each product is accused of infringing each patent zebra has filed an answer to paxar americas’ complaint denying paxar americas’ allegations of infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses including the invalidity of paxar americas’ asserted patent claims 

  

on november 21 2003 zebra’s subsidiary zih corp zih filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against paxar corporation alleging that paxar corporation printers infringe zih’s us patent nos 5813343 and 5860753 paxar corporation answered zih’s complaint denying infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment that zih’s patentsinsuit are not infringed and are invalid andor unenforceable paxar corporation filed a motion to transfer zih’s massachusetts suit to ohio federal court zih opposed paxar corporation’s motion to transfer and the parties are awaiting the court’s ruling on the transfer motion 

  

on november 25 2003 paxar americas filed a complaint against zih in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents asserted by zih in its massachusetts complaint are not infringed and are invalid and unenforceable on december 17 2003 paxar americas amended its complaint to add zebra technologies corporation as a defendant the parties have filed a motion to stay this action pending the massachusetts district court’s ruling on paxar corporation’s motion to transfer the parties have agreed to file a motion to transfer this action to the massachusetts district court if the massachusetts district court denies paxar corporation’s pending motion to transfer 

  

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain particularly in cases such as these where sophisticated factual issues must be assessed and complex technical issues must be decided as a result we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these lawsuits in the event we are unsuccessful in our defense of paxar americas’ infringement claims we could be liable for economic and other damages and we may be forced to incur ongoing licensing expenses or to change how we design manufacture and market our products the patents that zih has asserted against paxar corporation could be found invalid we expect to incur substantial fees to prosecute and defend these lawsuits we are unable at this time to estimate the range of the potential liability that would result from an unsuccessful defense and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies no liability has been recorded in zebra’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2003

 item 5   market for registrant’s common stock and related stockholder matters 

  

stock information price range and common stock 

our class a common stock is traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol zbra the following table shows the high and low trade prices for each quarter in 2003 and 2002 as reported by the nasdaq stock market we adjusted all share prices for a 50 stock dividend that was distributed on august 21 2003 on july 1 2003 all of zebra’s class b common stock that was outstanding at the time converted into an equal number of class a common stock as a result of this conversion zebra has one class of common stock outstanding 

  

   

   

source the nasdaq stock market 

  

at february 20 2004 the last reported price for the class a common stock was 6639 per share and there were 380 registered stockholders of record for the company’s class a common stock 

  

dividend policy 

since our initial public offering in 1991 we have not declared any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock zebra intends to retain its earnings to finance future growth and therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

  

 




 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

results of operations fourth quarter of 2003 versus fourth quarter of 2002 year ended december 31 2003 versus year ended december 31 2002 

  

sales 

sales by product category percent change and percent of total sales for the three months and year ended december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 were in thousands except percentages 

   

   

sales to customers by geographic region percent changes and percent of total sales for the three months and year ended december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 were in thousands except percentages 

  

   

   

we have consistently invested in sales marketing and product development to support longterm sales growth including 

  

•   expanding our geographic presence by placing zebra representatives in highgrowth geographic markets to expand channel relationships and to support the work of existing reseller partners during 2002 we put new zebra representatives in poland dubai russia australia brazil and argentina we also added representatives in mexico

  

 

and china during 2003 these additions are an important reason for the increase in the asiapacific and the latin american regions during the fourth quarter and the full year of 2003 

  

•   increasing our european representation in mobile and business development manager resources in germany italy france and spain during 2003

  

•   building infrastructure to deliver business improvement applications to highgrowth vertical markets during 2003 we also added marketing resources to support emerging radio frequency identification rfid opportunities

  

new printer products defined as printers released within 18 months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period accounted for 218 of printer sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002 for the full year new printer products accounted for 233 of printer sales in 2003 compared with 222 in 2002 

  

our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies primarily the dollar pound and euro which causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates when significant currency rate fluctuations occur we review our pricing and make appropriate changes in order to maintain our competitive position 

  

since the third quarter of 2002 the dollar has weakened significantly against both the euro and pound as a result our fourth quarter sales translated into dollars increased by 6253000 or 49 percentage points compared to translating the same sales using the exchange rates that prevailed a year ago competitive pricing adjustments caused by the currency situation reduced sales by 3590000 or 28 percentage points in total the net increase related to exchange rate fluctuations was 2663000 during the quarter 

  

for the full year of 2003 sales translated into dollars increased by 24783000 or 52 percentage points compared to translating the same sales using the exchange rates that prevailed in 2002 we adjusted our pricing to remain competitive in markets experiencing currency strength against the dollar these competitive pricing adjustments reduced sales by 12610000 or 27 percentage points in total the net increase related to exchange rate fluctuations was 12173000 during 2003 

  

although management cannot forecast the future direction of foreign exchange rate movements if rates remain near the levels experienced during 2003 zebra may continue to benefit from exchange rate gains during 2004 however it is possible that a continued weak dollar versus the pound and euro may cause our current pricing to be uncompetitive and require price reductions these reductions would decrease the benefits of the current favorable exchange rates 

  

during 2003 we began a program to hedge a portion of our forecasted eurodenominated sales so that if exchange rate trends reverse we will still achieve some benefit from the current favorable rates see note 14 to the financial statements for a more detailed discussion of this hedging program 

  

printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below 

  

   

for the fourth quarter of 2003 mobile printers accounted for 93 percentage points of the total 128 volume increase this increase is a result of more companies adopting technology for wireless networks the increase in the average unit selling prices was a result of higher average prices for midrange tabletop printers and print engines offset by the higher mobile printer volumes 

  

for the full year of 2003 the increase in printer volume was due to higher sales volume of desktop and mobile printers similar to the increases for the fourth quarter average unit selling price increases were related to increases in the average unit selling prices of midrange desktop printers portable printers and print engines average unit selling prices were also being reduced by the increased volume of the lower priced mobile printers 

  

 

gross profit 

gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the major contributors to the margin improvement were 

•   higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume representing 6008000 of the total gross profit increase for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 17417000 for the full year

•   foreign exchange rate movements and related pricing adjustments which we estimate increased gross profit by 2276000 for the fourth quarter of 2003 for the full year gross profit is estimated to have been 10900000 higher due to foreign exchange rate movements net of related pricing adjustments

•   component cost reductions contributed 2255000 to the margin improvement during the fourth quarter and 9371000 for the full year

  

selling and marketing expenses 

selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

we continue to make significant investments in demandgenerating activities during the fourth quarter of 2003 increased selling and marketing expenses were primarily in payroll and benefits other costs that increased during the fourth quarter were advertising publications and market research travel and entertainment and demonstration units year todate in addition to increases in the items mentioned above we increased market development fund expenses these increases are largely the result of our focus on vertical market development and international expansion 

  

research and development costs 

zebra is committed to a longterm strategy of significant investment in product development to maintain and build our product pipeline we made expenditures in research and development summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

quarterly product development expenses fluctuate widely depending on the status of ongoing projects for the fourth quarter of 2003 research and development expenses increased because of an increase in payroll and benefits with related increases in headcounts and increases in project expenses higher project expenses are related to the reduction of expenses in the fourth quarter of 2002 of 1092000 for third party funded engineering costs which did not reoccur in 2003 this amount represents 164 of the total increase in research and development expenses for the fourth quarter 

  

for the full year project expenses were up 1669000 with the majority of that increase related to 1542000 in reductions related to third party funded engineering costs that had occurred in 2002 but did not reoccur in 2003 in addition payroll and benefits were up 1752000 over 2002 but consulting expenses were down 945000 

  

we believe that there will be longterm growth in the use of radio frequency identification rfid in supply chain and other applications and that zebra is well positioned to participate in that growth we introduced new products that extend rfid technologies into our bar code label printers and we anticipate investing a larger portion of our future rd expenditures on the development of rfid printerencoders 

  

 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are summarized in the table below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

for the fourth quarter of 2003 general and administrative expenses increased 721000 and include 477000 of increased legal expenses which was primarily related to litigation with paxar described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements other increases were related to personnel costs 

  

for the full year of 2003 general and administrative expenses include 596000 of increased legal expenses related to 

•   litigation with paxar

•   increased intellectual property work

•   international activity

•   general contract review

  

in addition to legal expenses in 2003 we saw an increase in director and officer liability insurance and administrative personnel costs a portion of these costs resulted from new compliance requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and related regulations offsetting these increases was a decline in consulting expenses 

  

as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses declined because we took actions to control costs including the compliance activities discussed above as a result our general and administrative costs have grown slower than the rate of sales growth we expect that trend to continue 

  

costs related to terminated acquisitions and merger costs 

during the first quarter of 2002 we terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which zebra would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock including associated rights to purchase preferred stock of fargo electronics inc for 725 per share in cash during the time that the tender offer was active we incurred legal accounting and other expenses related to the proposed acquisition that would have been treated as part of the purchase price had the tender offer been completed we expensed 3300000 of these costs at the cancellation of the tender offer 

  

exit costs 

during the fourth quarter of 2003 we announced a plan to close our engineering site in varades france this plan will be accounted for under sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities included in operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2003 and the full year are exit costs consisting of primarily severance in the amount of 1232000 

  

during january 2004 we announced plans to consolidate our warwick rhode island printer manufacturing and repair service business into our camarillo california and vernon hills illinois locations although no costs have been accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003 we anticipate that during 2004 we will incur additional expenses of 1648000 of which approximately 400000 will be incurred during the first quarter see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

operating income 

operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in operating income is attributable to the following factors 

  

•   accelerated sales growth compared to 2002

  

 

•   improved gross margins resulting from increased overhead utilization

•   favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for zebra’s nondollar denominated business and

•   cost controls that held operating expense growth slightly below the rate of sales growth

  

as a result of these actions operating income increased by 30 percentage points more than the rate of sales growth during the fourth quarter and 141 percentage points more than the rate of sales growth for the full year 

  

nonoperating income and expenses 

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

  

   

higher investment balances resulted in an increase in investment income for the fourth quarter while investment balances were higher in 2003 yeartodate investment income decreased from last year because 2002 results included a 1953000 realized gain on the sale of 585000 shares of fargo electronics during the first quarter of 2002 

  

for the fourth quarter of 2003 we had the following two unusual items that increased investment income in relation to the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

•   interest income of 422000 was received which was related to refunds of taxes from the internal revenue service research and experimentation credit and the state of illinois tax settlement

•   investment income includes a 600000 increase in realized gains from partnership interests during the fourth quarter

  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 312 compared with 350 for the same quarter last year this rate is lower than the 350 effective tax rate that zebra has recorded since early 2002 because of the net effect of a nonrecurring tax item during the quarter 

  

during the fourth quarter zebra settled its longstanding dispute with the illinois department of revenue we recorded a decrease to income tax expense of 1342000 because our reserves for this tax dispute exceeded the amount of the settlement see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more details without the effect of this settlement our effective income tax rate would have been 35 for the quarter 

  

during the third quarter of 2003 we eliminated a reserve related to research and experimentation tax credits that were claimed and recorded a reduction to income tax expense of 1947000 during the first two quarters of 2003 we filed refund applications totaling 1947000 with the internal revenue service and departments of revenue for illinois and california related to research and experimentation tax credits for 1998 to 2001 because of the uncertainty of receiving the credits which require significant subjective analysis we established a 100 reserve against the contingent receivable for the refunds during each of the first two quarters of 2003 in september 2003 the irs approved our refund applications because california and illinois law mirror the federal tax code we now expect to have those refunds approved as well 

  

for 2003 the effective income tax rate was 326 versus 354 for 2002 excluding the two tax adjustments discussed above our effective tax rate would have been 35 for 2003 with the settlement of the illinois tax dispute we anticipate our tax provision rate will be 3475 beginning in the first quarter of 2004 

  

 

net income 

zebra’s net income is summarized below in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

 

comparison of years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

sales 

sales by product category related percent changes and percent of total sales for 2002 and 2001 were as follows 

  

   

sales to customers by geographic region related percent changes and percent of total sales for 2002 and 2001 were as follows 

  

   during 2002 and 2001 despite an economic downturn zebra implemented a growth strategy including 

  

•   new product introductions—during 2002 zebra spent 29 million on new product development activities for salaries benefits consulting and legal services market research and related activities fourteen new products or derivative products were introduced during 2002 compared to 11 new products introduced during 2001 additionally products introduced within the 18month period ended december 31 2002 represented 22 of printer sales for 2002

•   expanded international coverage—we opened six new sales offices during late 2001 through 2002 including poland dubai russia australia brazil and argentina we believe international regions particularly asiapacific latin america and eastern europe hold significant growth potential

•   new sales and marketing programs—we organized sales and marketing efforts to support a sales strategy that demonstrates the business benefits associated with implementing bar code labeling and specialty printing solutions

  

in north america we recorded positive sales growth in the second third and fourth quarters of 2002 compared with the corresponding periods of 2001 overall however the slow us economy continued to limit sales growth of bar code label and receipt printers to rates below our historical average 

  

   

all three of our international regions – europe asia pacific and latin america – had record sales and contributed to the significant growth in international sales in 2002 increased numbers of zebra representatives in these regions including the formation of a sales team in europe for mobile printing solutions in 2001 was an important factor in the growth of international sales 

  

on a dollarvolume basis the largest increase occurred in the european region the strength of the pound and the euro versus the dollar increased sales for zebra’s european region by approximately 5565000 compared with exchange rates that prevailed during 2001 

  

 

gross profit 

gross profit information is summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

gross profit increased due to 

•   higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume representing 8514800 of the total gross profit increase for 2002 

•   foreign exchange rate movements which we estimate increased gross profit by 4377000 for 2002 compared with the exchange rates that prevailed during 2001

•   cost reductions  which represented 3798000 of the gross profit increase for 2002

  

  

selling and marketing expenses 

selling and marketing expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted from 

  

•   increased headcount in selling and marketing staff including the new international offices opened in late 2001 and through 2002

•   performancerelated payroll expenses specifically commissions and bonuses related to zebra’s growth in net sales

•   trade show travel and consulting expenses

  

research and development costs 

research and development costs are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

printer products introduced over an 18month period that ended december 31 2002 accounted for approximately 22 of printer sales for 2002 compared with 20 for the comparable period ending december 31 2001 higher project and personnel expenses were partially offset by lower expenditures for consulting services we consider our ability to develop and introduce new products to be a significant competitive factor accordingly we expect to continue high levels of expenditures on the development of a broad range of printers and related items 

  

 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses are summarized below in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to 

•   higher bonus payments related to the growth in net sales and profits

•   consulting expenses for the development and implementation of growth strategies

•   information systems and

•   increased insurance costs

  

amortization of intangible assets 

during 2002 zebra recorded 1494000 in amortization of intangible assets compared with 5233000 for 2001 during the first quarter of 2002 zebra implemented sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  which replaces the requirements to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with a requirement for an annual impairment test sfas no 142 also establishes requirements for identifiable intangible assets as a result during the first quarter of 2002 zebra reclassified 21272000 of intangible assets into goodwill as such assets which included assembled workforce and customer lists did not meet the criteria for recognition as an asset apart from goodwill under sfas no 142 operating income for 2001 includes 3835000 of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not included in the 2002 results due to the implementation of sfas no 142 

  

costs related to terminated acquisitions and merger costs 

during 2002 we terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which zebra would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock including associated rights to purchase preferred stock of fargo electronics inc for 725 per share in cash during the time that the tender offer was active we incurred legal accounting and other expenses related to the proposed acquisition that would have been treated as part of the purchase price had the tender offer been completed we expensed 3300000 of these costs at the cancellation of the tender offer 

  

we incurred merger costs of 73000 in 2002 and 1838000 in 2001 these costs related to the acquisition of comtec information systems in april 2000 these costs and the related activities were completed during 2002 

  

operating income 

operating income is summarized in the following table in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the increase in operating income is attributable to the following factors 

  

•   sales growth

•   improved gross margins resulting from increased overhead utilization

•   favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for zebra’s nondollar denominated business and

•   cost controls that held operating expense growth slightly below the rate of sales growth

  

as a result of these actions operating income increased by 44 percentage points more than the rate of sales growth during 2002 

  

 

nonoperating income and expenses 

zebra’s nonoperating income and expense items are summarized in the following table in thousands 

  

   

favorable investment income was a result of a 1953000 pretax gain on the sale of 585000 shares of common stock of fargo electronics in addition to the absence of a 2242000 pretax writedown of a longterm investment that occurred in 2001 the writedown occurred because the decline in the asset’s value was viewed as other than temporary this writedown reduced 2001 diluted earnings by 003 per share zebra recorded an additional writedown of 193000 for this investment in 2002 

  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate for 2002 was 354 versus 360 in 2001 this change is the result of implementing tax minimization strategies during the third quarter of 2002 

  

net income 

zebra’s net income is summarized below in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions we believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable based upon the information available 

  

our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra’s reported financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

zebra recognizes sales from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title which are generally the same other items that affect our revenue recognition include 

  

customer returns 

customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns a significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material effect on our operating results a 10 increase decrease in returns above historical levels would have decreased increased operating income for the fourth quarter of 2003 by 132000 or 04 of operating income 

  

volume rebates 

some of our customers are offered incentive rebates based on the volume of product they purchase from us over a quarter or year these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue each quarter we estimate the amount of outstanding volume rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history historically actual volume rebates have been in line with our estimates 

  

 

price protection 

some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve which is charged against revenue our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products as a result the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 

  

software revenue 

we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows 

•   our printers contain embedded firmware which is part of the hardware purchase we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 

•   we sell a limited amount of prepackaged or offtheshelf software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers there is no customization required to use this software and we have no postshipment obligations on the software revenue is recognized as this prepackaged software is shipped 

•   we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 

  

shipping and handling 

we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 

  

investments and marketable securities 

investments and marketable securities at december 31 2003 consisted of us government securities 448 state and municipal bonds 454 corporate bonds 46 partnership interests 44 and equity securities 08 we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading availableforsale or heldtomaturity trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term heldtomaturity securities are those securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity all securities not included in trading or heldtomaturity are classified as availableforsale 

  

trading and availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings unrealized holding gains and losses net of the related tax effect on availableforsale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized 

  

during the first quarter of 2003 we changed the classification of certain of our investments and marketable securities from the trading category to the availableforsale category because we are no longer buying securities with the intent of selling them in the nearterm in accordance with sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities the market value as of the date of the change is now the new cost basis and all future unrealized gains and losses will be reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income section of stockholders’ equity in the balance sheet this change was made because of changes in our investment strategies and is consistent with the classification of our investments and marketable securities as defined in sfas no 115 approximately 256000000 of our  330159 000 of investments was transferred from the trading category to the availableforsale category 

  

accounts receivable 

we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts including 

  

•   credit reviews of all new customer accounts 

•   ongoing credit evaluations of current customers 

•   credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information 

•   adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness and 

•   an active collection effort by regional credit functions reporting directly to the corporate financial officers 

  

  

we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues over the last three years accounts receivable reserves varied from 17 to 29 of total accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as of december 31 2003 were 1388000 or 17 of the balance due we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the improved quality of the portfolio as of december 31 2003 while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 

  

inventories 

we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the firstin firstout fifo method or the current estimated market value we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 

  

a significant increase in the demand for zebra’s products could result in a shortterm increase in the cost of inventory purchases however this would be offset by improved overhead utilization resulting from the additional demand a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 

  

our forecasted product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated if inventories were determined to be overvalued we would recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 

  

over the last three years our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 101 to 131 of gross inventory as of december 31 2003 reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were 6408000 or 131 of gross inventory reserves increased during 2003 due to products which are in the process of being discontinued 

  

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we test the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we completed our last assessment during june 2003 

  

we evaluate the impairment of other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

  

factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of 

•   significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 

•   significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business 

•   significant negative industry or economic trends 

•   significant decline in zebra’s stock price for a sustained period 

•   significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 

  

if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows net intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill amounted to 111242000 as of december 31 2003 

  

contingencies 

we recorded an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes quarterly we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 

  

on april 23 2003 paxar americas inc paxar americas filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio against zebra and certain of its subsidiaries paxar americas’ complaint alleges that certain of zebra’s printer products infringe one or more of eight identified paxar americas patents although not each product is accused of infringing each patent zebra has filed an answer to paxar americas’ complaint denying paxar americas’ allegations of infringement and asserting several affirmative defenses including the invalidity of paxar americas’ asserted patent claims 

  

 

on november 21 2003 zih corp zih filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against paxar corporation alleging that paxar corporation printers infringe zih’s us patent nos 5813343 and 5860753 paxar corporation answered zih’s complaint denying infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment that zih’s patentsinsuit are not infringed and are invalid andor unenforceable paxar corporation filed a motion to transfer zih’s massachusetts suit to ohio federal court zih opposed paxar corporation’s motion to transfer and the parties are awaiting the court’s ruling on the transfer motion 

  

on november 25 2003 paxar americas filed a complaint against zih in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that the patents asserted by zih in its massachusetts complaint are not infringed and are invalid and unenforceable on december 17 2003 paxar americas amended its complaint to add zebra technologies corporation as a defendant the parties have filed a motion to stay this action pending the massachusetts district court’s ruling on paxar corporation’s motion to transfer the parties have agreed to file a motion to transfer this action to the massachusetts district court if the massachusetts district court denies paxar corporation’s pending motion to transfer 

  

we are unable at this time to estimate the range of the potential liability that would result from an unsuccessful defense and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies no liability has been recorded in zebra’s consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2003 

  

stockbased compensation 

as of december 31 2003 zebra had three stockbased compensation plans available for future grants we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations no stockbased compensation cost is reflected in net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation to stockbased compensation in thousands except per share amounts 

  

   

expectations 

during our quarterly conference call on february 18 2004 we provided net sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2004 as follows amounts in thousands except per share data 

  

   

the effective tax rate is expected to be 3475 of income before income taxes 

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

zebra continued to generate cash well in excess of its operating requirements as a result zebra’s cash and investment balances have grown over time as of december 31 2003 zebra had 449964000 in cash cash equivalents investments and marketable securities compared with 348577000 at december 31 2002 factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2003 include 

  

•   operations provided a net cash increase of 109144000 primarily from net income

•   accounts receivable increased 5141000 net of the effect of foreign currency translation adjustment because of higher sales

•   inventories increased 1659000 net of foreign currency translation adjustment this is due to higher sales offset by improvements in inventory utilization compared to the same period a year ago inventory turns increased slightly to 68 from 67

•   other assets decreased primarily due to the receipt of tax protest deposits returned from the state of illinois and a decrease in the value of the foreign exchange forward contracts but these decreases are offset by increases in longterm investments

•   with the effect of foreign currency translation adjustment being the predominant cause accounts payable decreased by 3156000

•   accrued expenses net of the effect of foreign currency translation adjustment increased due to higher payroll accruals and unearned revenue

•   taxes payable decreased 962000 because of the timing of tax payments and the settlement of the illinois tax matter offset by increased profits in addition our effective income tax rate decreased to 326 in 2003 from 354 in 2002

•   purchases of property and equipment totaled 8407000

•   stock option exercises contributed 17620000

  

zebra’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 were 

  

   

purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements primarily raw materials 

  

management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in january 2003 the fasb issued fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46 requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if we have a majority of the risks rewards or both of that entity fin 46 will be effective for most vies beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 zebra has no investments in variable interest entities therefore fin 46 has no effect on our financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure amending sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  to provide alternative transition methods for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation zebra does not currently intend to make this change 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 149 clarifies when a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and 

  

 

when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statements of cash flows sfas no 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and had no impact on zebra’s financial position or results of operations 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas no 150 sets standards for classification and measurement by an issuer of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires treating these instruments as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because the financial instrument is an obligation of the issuer zebra has issued no financial instruments with these characteristics and sfas no 150 had no effect on our financial statements 

  

risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks uncertainties and other factors described below as well as other disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because they could have a material adverse effect on zebra’s business financial condition operating results and growth prospects 

  

zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the writeoff of certain acquisition costs 

zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses technologies services or products the process of integrating any acquired business technology service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized moreover zebra may be unable to identify negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated zebra may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition which could be significant 

  

zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 

to be successful zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 

  

zebra’s industry is characterized by 

•   rapidly changing technology 

•   evolving industry standards 

•   frequent new product and service introductions 

•   evolving distribution channels 

•   changing customer demands 

  

future success will depend on zebra’s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment zebra could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 

  

zebra competes in a highly competitive market which is likely to become more competitive competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 

zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems principal competitors have substantial marketing financial development and personnel resources to remain competitive zebra believes it must continue to provide 

•   technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands 

•   superior customer service 

•   high levels of quality and reliability and 

•   dependable and efficient distribution networks 

  

zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions lower gross profit margins and loss of market share and could require increased spending on research and development sales and marketing and customer support some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products any of these factors could reduce zebra’s earnings 

  

  

the inability to protect intellectual property could harm zebra’s reputation and its competitive position may be materially damaged 

zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides zebra with certain competitive advantages copyrights patents trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of zebra’s products or without authorization to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 

  

zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers these circumstances create a number of risks 

zebra sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include 

•   fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales or increase costs of purchasing in foreign countries 

•   foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs quotas taxes trade barriers or capital flow restrictions 

•   political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk 

•   restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 

•   potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries such as china may limit recourse against infringing products or cause zebra to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 

•   staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 

•   zebra may not be able to control international distributors working on its behalf 

  

economic factors which are outside zebra’s control could lead to deterioration in the quality of zebra’s accounts receivables 

zebra sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra’s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 

  

infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put zebra at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 

third parties may claim that zebra violated their intellectual property rights to the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right zebra may be prevented from operating its business as planned and may be required to pay damages to obtain a license if available or to use a noninfringing method if possible to accomplish its objectives any of these claims with or without merit could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 

  

zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 

future success of zebra is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel the loss of the service of any executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business zebra has no longterm employment agreements with key personnel and maintains minimal key man life insurance policies on its key employees 

  

the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra’s longterm success competition for personnel in zebra’s industry is intense and zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 

  

terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect zebra’s stock price operations and profitability 

the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september 11 2001 caused major instability in the us and other financial markets possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact the united states continues to take military action against terrorism and is currently engaged in a costly occupation of iraq these events may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere which may further contribute to economic instability any such attacks could among other things cause further instability in 

  

 

financial markets and could directly or indirectly through reduced demand negatively affect zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 

  

taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 

zebra operates in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and worldwide and uses strategies to minimize its tax expense local tax authorities may challenge these tax positions from time to time adverse outcomes in these situations may exceed zebra’s reserves for tax payments and may increase zebra’s effective tax rate 

  

 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio as stated in our written investment policy the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk which includes the risk of interest rate movements risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 

  

zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies and which limits the types of investments that may be made moreover the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 

  

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra’s investment portfolio as of december 31 2003 in thousands except per share data 

  

   

foreign exchange risk 

  

we conduct business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and therefore are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue and accounts receivable we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments 

  

hedging of net assets 

we use forward contracts and options to manage exposure related to our pound and euro denominated net assets we record gains and losses on these contracts and options in income each quarter along with the translation gains and losses related to our net euro asset position which would ordinarily offset each other summary financial information related to these activities follows in thousands 

  

   

   

 

hedging of anticipated sales 

during the second quarter of 2003 we began a program to manage the exchange rate risk of anticipated euro denominated sales using forward contracts and designated these contracts as cash flow hedges gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income until the contracts are settled and the hedged sales are realized at which time the deferred gains or losses will be reported as an increase or decrease to sales summary financial information related to the cash flow hedges of future revenues follows in thousands except percentages 

  

   

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point movement in the dollarpound and dollareuro rates measured as if zebra did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above it is based on the dollareuro and dollarpound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities as of december 31 2003 in thousands except per share data 

  

   

equity price risk 

from time to time zebra has taken direct equity positions in companies these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company zebra is exposed to the risks associated with such investments 

  

zebra currently employs four investment managers two of which manage portfolios of investment funds ie fund of funds these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies some of which involve the use of equity securities each investment manager’s portfolio is designed to be market neutral although an individual fund within a portfolio may be exposed to market risk by policy management limits the amount of zebra’s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of 20 of the total investment portfolio with no single investment exceeding 12000000 

  

zebra utilizes a “valueatrisk” var model to determine the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments 

  

the following table sets forth the impact of a onepercentage point change in the value of all equity positions held by zebra’s investment managers in thousands per share data 

  

   

 




 item 9    changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures 

not applicable 

  




 item 9a    controls and procedures 

zebra’s management is responsible for designing and implementing disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable not absolute assurances that desired control objectives are achieved including 

  

•   filing with the sec all required disclosures within the time limits specified by the sec

•   providing all material information to our management including the ceo and cfo to enable them to make timely decisions about required disclosures

  

when designing and evaluating controls and procedures we make assumptions about the likelihood of future events at the same time we make judgments about the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures we cannot assure that this design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions similarly we cannot assure that our evaluation of controls will detect all control issues or instances of fraud if any 

  

we completed our review of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of the disclosure committee and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer based on this review the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2003 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that reports are filed or submitted within the time limits specified by the sec and that information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure there was not any change in zebra’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during 2003 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect zebra’s internal control over financial reporting
