we provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services 1 under the caption “analysis of net interest income” on page f4 of the financial section of this report 2 under the caption “ratevolume analysis” on page f5 of the financial section of this report and 3 under the caption “noninterest income” on pages f6 through f7 of the financial section of this report 

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their primary geographic markets covering the major metropolitan areas in texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida in addition they compete throughout the continental us mexico and canada as they pursue certain businesses on a national scale that fall outside of the primary markets such as us banking mortgage banker environmental services and national dealer services they have strategically placed offices in faster growing markets where there is a concentration of customers and industries they serve in 2021 comerica also expanded its presence in the southeastern us by establishing three commercial offices in north carolina comerica is subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation commercial loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation customer convenience quality customer service and responsiveness to customer needs and the overall relationship with our clients our competitors are large national and regional financial institutions as well as smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while potentially strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system furthermore given that comerica bank is a bank with assets in excess of 10 billion dollars it is subject to supervision and regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial laws the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law and therefore comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each also subject to regulation and examination by the fdic certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” the department of labor “dol” regulates financial institutions providing services to plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 comerica bank’s canada branch is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and its mexico representative office is supervised by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” the department of licensing and regulatory affairs of the state of michigan the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc the department of insurance and financial services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc and the dol in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc 

both the scope of the laws and regulations and intensity of supervision to which comerica’s business is subject have increased over the past decade in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place in 2018 with the passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as described below there has been some recalibration of the postfinancial crisis framework however comerica’s business remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision 

comerica is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as well as the rules of the new york stock exchange 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act 

on may 24 2018 egrrcpa was signed into law among other regulatory changes egrrcpa amended various sections of the doddfrank act including section 165 of doddfrank act which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies under egrrcpa bank holding companies with less than 100 billion of consolidated assets including comerica are exempt from all of the doddfrank enhanced prudential standards except risk committee requirements as a result comerica currently is not subject to the remaining doddfrank act enhanced prudential standards or certain capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions the “tailoring rules” should comerica cross the 100 billion asset threshold it will be subject to additional and more stringent regulation enhanced prudential standards for us banking organizations with 100 to 250 billion of consolidated assets or more include but are not limited to supervisoryrun stress testing internal liquidity stress testing and liquidity buffer requirements in addition comerica would be required to pay the supervision and regulation fee assessment under the doddfrank act 

requirements for approval of activities and acquisitions 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements described below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb determines in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 

in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company comerica and each of its depository institution subsidiaries must each remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” and comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if comerica or any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

in addition the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica bank’s current rating under the cra is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies in many cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including whether comerica and its subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed are in compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations or have cra ratings of less than “satisfactory” 

acquisitions of ownership of comerica 

acquisitions of comerica’s voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws including the bank holding company act of 1956 and the change in bank control act of 1978 under the change in bank control act a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the frb before acquiring the power to vote 10 or more of comerica’s outstanding common stock on march 2 2020 the frb issued a final rule revising regulations related to control determinations under the bank holding company act the final rule expands the number of presumptions of control for use in such determinations investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of comerica’s stock 

capital and liquidity 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb fdic andor the occ in calculating riskbased capital requirements a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type asset class and maturity a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses on september 30 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides banking organizations that implement the current expected credit loss “cecl” standard during the 2020 calendar year the option to delay for two years an estimate of cecl’s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital followed by a 

threeyear transition period while comerica elected this deferral there was no deferral amount at december 31 2021  more information is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f16 through f17 

entities that engage in trading activities that exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital to account for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comerica’s trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica adjusts its riskweighted assets to account for market risk as required 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries like other bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio minimum tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 45 percent 6 percent and 8 percent of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively comerica and its bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 25 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses comerica and its bank subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted average total assets of 4 percent 

to be well capitalized comerica’s bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio minimum cet1 capital ratio minimum tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 50 percent 65 percent 80 percent and 100 percent respectively for purposes of the frb’s regulation y including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company bank holding companies such as comerica must maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 60 percent and a total capital ratio of at least 100 percent to be well capitalized the frb may require bank holding companies including comerica to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition risk profile and growth plans 

failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators including restrictions on comerica’s or its bank subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on growth 

at december 31 2021 comerica met all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable well capitalized requirements as shown in the table below 



additional information on the calculation of comerica’s and its bank subsidiaries’ cet1 capital tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f16 through f17 of the financial section of this report and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f92 through f94 of the financial section of this report 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

as of december 31 2021 each of comerica’s bank subsidiaries’ capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapitalbased safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

dividends 

comerica incorporated is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries since comerica’s consolidated net income and liquidity consists largely of net income of and dividends received from comerica’s bank subsidiaries comerica’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon its receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below no assurances can be given that comerica’s bank subsidiaries will in any circumstances pay dividends to comerica 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2022 comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 347 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 852 million in 2021 498 million in 2020 and 12 billion in 2019 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries must maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of 25 to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends 

furthermore federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia “prompt corrective action” regime discussed above which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

frb supervisory guidance generally provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless 1 the bank holding company’s net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid is sufficient to fully fund the dividends 2 the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and 3 the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios the supervisory guidance also provides that a bank holding company should inform the frb reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company’s capital structure bank holding companies also are required to consult with the frb before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments including common stock or materially increasing dividends 

transactions with affiliates 

federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comerica’s affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate including financial subsidiaries to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include i a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate ii a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate iii a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate iv the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan v the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and vi securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders 

data privacy and cybersecurity regulation 

comerica is subject to many us federal us state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data privacy protection which require among other things maintaining policies and procedures to protect the nonpublic confidential information of customers and employees the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica and its subsidiaries from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state levels limit comerica’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions including comerica and their thirdparty service providers the proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector comerica continues to monitor the development of this rule 

data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including an exemption applicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the california attorney general adopted regulations implementing the ccpa on august 14 2020 comerica has a physical footprint in california and is required to comply with the ccpa in addition similar laws may be adopted by other states where comerica does business the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation 

like other lenders comerica bank and other of comerica’s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act “fcra” and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on comerica and its subsidiaries 

fdic insurance assessments 

the dif provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to 250000 per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are 

determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2021 comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 22 million 

antimoney laundering regulations 

comerica is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering terrorist financing and transactions with persons companies or foreign governments designated by us authorities aml laws this category of laws includes the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act and the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 or usa patriot act 

the aml laws and their implementing regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the aml laws and their regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the office of foreign assets control “ofac” is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include 1 restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and 2 a blocking of assets in which the government or “specially designated nationals” of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 percent the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations the frb may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bank holding company’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements comerica may in the future be required to provide 

financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress capital loans by comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks in the event of comerica’s bankruptcy any commitment by comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary banks would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

supervisory and enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad supervisory and enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to conduct examinations and investigations impose nonpublic supervisory agreements issue cease and desist orders terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties bank regulators regularly examine the operations of bank holding companies and banks and the results of these examinations as well as certain supervisory and enforcement actions are confidential and may not be made public 

resolution plans 

as a depository institution with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets comerica bank is required to periodically file a resolution plan with the fdic on april 16 2019 the fdic released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” with respect to the fdic’s bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size complexity and risk profile the anpr offers two alternative approaches to resolution planning for commenters to consider and solicits comment on how to tailor the requirements of the rule to reflect differences in size complexity and other factors among the population of large insured depository institutions and on whether to increase the current threshold of 50 billion in assets that triggers application of the rule in connection with this rulemaking the fdic placed a moratorium on resolution plans until the rulemaking process was complete 

on june 25 2021 the fdic lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for institutions with 100 billion or more in total assets under the fdic’s statement on resolution plans for idis  an institution will be required to submit resolution plans when it has 100 billion or more in total assets as determined based upon the average of the institution’s four most recent reports of condition and income 

incentivebased compensation 

comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica it is comerica’s intent to continue monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation practices 

in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage 

inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

the volcker rule 

comerica is prohibited under the volcker rule from 1 engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for its own account and 2 having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting and trading in us government and agency obligations and permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities 

comerica has compliance programs required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in covered funds additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments which includes the covered funds is set forth in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f49 of the financial section of this report 

in october 2019 the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule finalized changes designed to simplify compliance with the volcker rule the final rule formalized a threetiered approach to compliance program requirements for banking entities based on their level of trading activity as a banking entity with “moderate” trading assets and liabilities less than 20 billion comerica is subject to simplified compliance requirements in june 2020 regulators finalized a rule further modifying the volcker rule’s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds the final rule modifies three areas of the rule by streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address comerica continues to follow volcker rule developments 

derivative transactions 

as a state member bank comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable texas and federal law title vii of the doddfrank act contains a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements do not impact comerica directly since comerica bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or major swap participant comerica continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly on november 5 2018 the cftc issued a final rule that sets the permanent aggregate gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis exception from the definition of swap dealer at 8 billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding 12 months comericas swap dealing activities for purposes of the de minimis exception are currently below this threshold 

the initial margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps will be effective for comerica’s swap and securitybased swap counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants on september 1 2022 at which time such counterparties will be required to collect initial margin from comerica the initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity comerica is currently working toward meeting compliance with the initial margin requirements

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “contemplates” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” “opportunity” “initiative” “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” “on track” “trend” “objective” “looks forward” “projects” “models” and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

credit risk 

• unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect comericas financial results 

although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances as occurred during the covid19 pandemic comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

• declines in the businesses or industries of comericas customers could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances which could adversely affect comerica 

comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive commercial real estate residential real estate and energy industries these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices in pa rticular in 2021 decreased balances in dealer services occurred due to an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive production additionally as companies implement policies to extend workfromhome arrangements the commercial real estate industry has been under more scrutiny finally while energy prices recovered in 2021 they are unlikely to remain stable and energy companies are expected to experience environmental pressure over the longterm any decline in one of these businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan for more information regarding certain of comericas lines of business please see concentrations of credit risk commercial real estate lending automotive lending  dealer automotive lending  production residential real estate lendingand “energy lending” on pages f23 through f25 of the financial section of this report 

additionally certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic such as retail commercial real estate retail goods and services hotels artsrecreation airlines restaurants and bars childcare coffee shops cruise lines education gasoline and convenience stores religious organizations senior living freight and travel arrangements and comerica has outstanding loans to clients in these industries as described below under other sectors most at risk due to economic stress resulting from covid19 impacts on page f26 of the financial section of this report 

• changes in customer behavior due to outside factors may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as pandemics inflation fuel prices energy costs tariffs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

market risk 

• governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry and therefore impact comericas financial condition and results of operations 

monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary policies determine in large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates or changes in the frbs balance sheet influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

• fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect comericas net interest income and balance sheet 

the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions and the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities a continued low interest rate environment will adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f27 of the financial section of this report 

deposits make up a large portion of comerica’s funding portfolio comericas funding costs may increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs will reduce comericas net interest margin and net interest income 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

• interest rates on comericas outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely affect its revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 certain libor tenors are no longer supported as of december 31 2021 and the fca has announced that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by comerica will cease to be supported after june 30 2023 while comerica stopped originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter of 2021 it still has substantial exposure to outstanding liborbased products including loans and derivatives approximately 71 percent of comericas loans at december 31 2021 were tied to libor which excludes the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed 

comerica is currently issuing new secured overnight financing rate sofrbased and bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsbybased cash and derivative products comerica continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition 

the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular such transition could 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenues and expenses associated with comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s historical role in determining market interest rates globally 

• adversely affect the value of comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s historical role in determining market interest rates globally 

• prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to comerica’s selection of alternative reference rates other than sofr and 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased instruments 

more information regarding the libor transition is available on page f30 under libor transition 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on comerica’s funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

liquidity risk 

• comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities 

comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition based on interest rates which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

• reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect comerica andor the holders of its securities 

rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

• the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica 

comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be monetized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica 

technology risk 

• comerica faces security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting comerica’s colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect its business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure 

comerica’s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which comerica is highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft comerica’s business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access comerica’s network products and services its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

cyber attacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in comericas systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems as cyber threats continue to evolve comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of comerica’s systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss 

although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner 

cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at comerica or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on comerica’s systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause comerica serious negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to comerica’s operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of its confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of its customers or damage to comerica’s or comerica’s customers’ andor third parties’ computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in comerica’s security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact its results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition although comerica maintains insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber 

losses subject to policy terms and conditions we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event 

• cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus 

as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including comerica and its bank subsidiaries and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica receives maintains and stores nonpublic personal information of comerica’s customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds including comerica for more information regarding data privacy regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information comerica may store or maintain comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with comerica’s current practices it may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts comerica’s operating results 

operational risk 

• comerica’s operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt comerica’s business and adversely impact comerica’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm 

the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout comerica’s business and as a result of its interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to comerica’s own internal operational functions comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages comericas use of mobile and cloud technologies as well as its hybrid work options permitting remote work can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica relies on its employees and third parties in its daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of comerica’s or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose comerica to risk for example comerica’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to comerica or to third parties with whom comerica interacts or upon whom it relies although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data in addition comerica’s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems 

comerica’s financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume andor customer activity 

electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics cyber attacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

• comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its delivery systems and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations 

comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services card processing services and trust processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

• legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry including those directly involving comerica and its subsidiaries could adversely affect comerica or the financial services industry in general 

comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

• comerica may incur losses due to fraud 

fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving examples include but are not limited to debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials employee fraud information theft and other malfeasance increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity comerica continues to invest in systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future 

• controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports comerica files or submits under the exchange act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met due to certain inherent limitations these limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented accordingly because of the inherent limitations in control systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

compliance risk 

• changes in regulation or oversight or changes in comerica’s status with respect to existing regulations or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations 

comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the occ the cfpb the cftc the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations and ability to make acquisitions investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations 

further even if such regulations or oversight do not change comericas business may develop such that it may be subject to increased regulatory requirements in 2021 comerica’s asset size increased and began to approach 100 billion certain enhanced prudential standards and related requirements will apply to comerica if it exceeds 100 billion in average total consolidated assets calculated over four consecutive financial quarters which could happen in the future category iv institutions 100 to 250 billion in assets under the tailoring rules are subject to additional requirements such as certain enhanced prudential standards and monitoring and reporting certain riskbased indicators under the tailoring rules category iv firms are among other things subject to 1 supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial basis 2 requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and 3 certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements including liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements comerica would also incur additional assessments under regulation tt if comerica becomes subject to enhanced prudential standards it will face more stringent requirements or limitations on its business as well as increased compliance costs and depending on its levels of capital and liquidity stress test results and other factors may be limited in the types of activities it may conduct and be limited as to how it utilizes capital further comerica may be subject to heightened expectations which could result in additional regulatory scrutiny higher penalties and more severe consequences if it is unable to meet those expectations 

• compliance with stringent capital requirements may adversely affect comerica 

comerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards as set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity or any existing requirements that comerica becomes subject to as a result of its increased asset size could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

• tax regulations could be subject to potential legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations 

federal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified andor modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica either directly or indirectly as a result of effects on comericas customers 

strategic risk 

• damage to comerica’s reputation could damage its businesses 

reputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

• comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services to its customers 

the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as well the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

• competitive product and pricing pressures within comericas markets may change 

comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation customer convenience quality customer service and responsiveness to customer needs and the overall relationship with our clients our competitors are large national and regional financial institutions as well as smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer 

additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• the introduction implementation withdrawal success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated which could adversely affect comericas business 

comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in 

comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business recently comerica expanded its presence in the southeastern us by establishing commercial offices in north carolina if comericas expansion is not successful it could adversely impact comericas expenses 

• managements ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations 

the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers these pressures may be exacerbated by the continued disruption to inperson activities due to covid19 failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

• managements ability to retain key officers and employees may change 

comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

• any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to comericas business and operations 

difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of any acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica would be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

general risk 

• the covid19 pandemic has and will likely continue to adversely impact our business and the ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains lowered equity market valuations created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increased unemployment levels as a result of the continued uncertainty related to the pandemic and its variants the demand for our products and services has been and is expected to continue to be significantly impacted furthermore the pandemic has influenced and could further influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and has increased and could further increase our allowance for credit losses as long as some businesses operations are impacted and as more customers may draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses in response to the pandemic we granted hardship relief assistance for customers experiencing financial difficulty as a result of covid19 including loan deferrals as of december 31 2021 pandemicrelated payment deferrals totaled 22 million representing approximately 10 obligors and consisting entirely of retail loans primarily residential mortgages certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic such as retail commercial real estate retail goods and services hotels artsrecreation airlines restaurants and bars childcare coffee shops cruise lines education gasoline and convenience stores religious organizations senior living freight and travel arrangements and comerica has outstanding loans to clients in these industries as described below under other sectors most at risk due to economic stress resulting from covid19 impacts on page f26 comericas business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic 

• general political economic or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may be less favorable than expected 

local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the economic environment and market conditions in which comerica operates continue to be uncertain while stimulus packages the rollout of the covid vaccine strong business spending and improved labor markets contributed to an overall improved economic outlook in 2021 there continues to be uncertainty related to the impact of emerging covid19 variants and vaccine efficacy supply chain constraints future monetary and fiscal support and inflationary pressures c onditions related to the covid19 pandemic inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts changes in trade policies and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica 

• methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective 

instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity technology operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

for more information regarding risk management please see risk management starting on page f17 of the financial section of this report 

• catastrophic events may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and comerica 

acts of terrorism cyberterrorism political unrest war civil disturbance armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters including tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us comerica’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

in particular certain of the regions where comerica operates including california texas and florida are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change these types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies comericas business and customers and have caused physical damage to comericas property in these regions 

further catastrophic events may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica 

in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

• changes in accounting standards could materially impact comericas financial statements 

from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comerica’s financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

• comericas accounting estimates and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain 

accounting estimates and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting estimates and processes so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in some cases management must select an accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting estimates as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting estimates” starting on page f34 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements starting on page f46 of the financial section of this report 

• comericas stock price can be volatile 

stock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive comericas stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

• actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations 

• recommendations or projections by securities analysts 

• operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to comerica 

• news reports relating to trends concerns and other issues in the financial services industry 

• perceptions in the marketplace regarding comerica andor its competitors 

• new technology used or services offered by competitors 

• significant acquisitions or business combinations strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving comerica or its competitors 

• changes in dividends and capital returns 

• changes in government regulations 

• cyclical fluctuations 

• geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 

• activity by short sellers and changing government restrictions on such activity 

general market fluctuations including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economy industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes oil price volatility or credit loss trends among other factors could also cause comericas stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 

for the above and other reasons the market price of comericas securities may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the securities and investors should consider this before relying on the market prices of comericas securities when making an investment decision

 item 1 business 

general 

comerica incorporated “comerica” is a financial services company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1973 and headquartered in dallas texas based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies fr y9c it was among the 25 largest commercial united states “us” financial holding companies as of december 31 2020 comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2 active banking subsidiaries comerica bank a texas banking association and comerica bank  trust national association and 31 nonbanking subsidiaries at december 31 2020 comerica had total assets of approximately 881 billion total deposits of approximately 729 billion total loans of approximately 523 billion and shareholders’ equity of approximately 81 billion 

comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management in addition to the three major business segments finance is also reported as a segment 

comerica operates in three primary geographic markets  texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida with select businesses operating in several other states and in canada and mexico 

we provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services 1 under the caption “analysis of net interest income” on page f5 of the financial section of this report 2 under the caption “ratevolume analysis” on page f6 of the financial section of this report and 3 under the caption “noninterest income” on pages f7 through f8 of the financial section of this report 

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation commercial loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation customer convenience quality customer service and responsiveness to customer needs and the overall relationship with our clients our competitors are large national and regional financial institutions as well as smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while potentially strengthening the franchises of acquirers

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system furthermore given that comerica bank is a bank with assets in excess of 10 billion dollars it is subject to supervision and regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial laws the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law and therefore comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each also subject to regulation and examination by the fdic certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” the department of labor “dol” regulates financial institutions providing services to plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 comerica bank’s canada branch is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and its mexico representative office is supervised by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” the department of licensing and regulatory affairs of the state of michigan and the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” in the case of comerica securities inc the department of insurance and financial services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc the dol in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc and world asset management inc 

both the scope of the laws and regulations and intensity of supervision to which comerica’s business is subject have increased over the past decade in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place in 2018 with the passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as described below there has been some recalibration of the postfinancial crisis framework however comerica’s business remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision further it is too soon for comerica to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur as a result of the recent change in leadership resulting from the recent elections or if changes occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

comerica is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as well as the rules of the new york stock exchange 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act 

on may 24 2018 egrrcpa was signed into law among other regulatory changes egrrcpa amended various sections of the doddfrank act including section 165 of doddfrank act which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies under egrrcpa bank holding companies with less than 100 billion of consolidated assets including comerica are exempt from all of the doddfrank enhanced prudential standards except risk committee requirements as a result comerica is no longer subject to doddfrank act supervisory and companyrun stress testing or required to file a resolution plan under section 165d of the doddfrank act comerica is not subject to internal liquidity stress testing and buffer requirements the comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process or the liquidity coverage ratio in addition comerica is no longer required to pay the supervision and regulation fee assessment under the doddfrank act 

banks with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica bank are also exempt from companyrun stress testing requirements under the egrrcpa 

requirements for approval of activities and acquisitions 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements described below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb determines in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 

in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company comerica and each of its depository institution subsidiaries must each remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” and comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if comerica or any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

in addition the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica bank’s current rating under the cra is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies in many cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including whether comerica and its subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed are in compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations or have cra ratings of less than “satisfactory” 

acquisitions of ownership of comerica 

acquisitions of comerica’s voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws including the bank holding company act of 1956 and the change in bank control act of 1978 under the change in bank control act a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the frb before acquiring the power to vote 10 or more of comerica’s outstanding common stock on march 2 2020 the frb issued a final rule revising regulations related to control determinations under the bank holding company act the final rule expands the number of presumptions for use in such determinations investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of comerica’s stock 

capital and liquidity 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ in calculating riskbased capital requirements a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses on september 30 2020 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides banking organizations that implement the current expected 

credit loss “cecl” standard during the 2020 calendar year the option to delay for two years an estimate of cecl’s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period comerica elected this deferral and at december 31 2020 72 million or a cumulative 11basispoint benefit to the capital ratios was deferred  more information is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f19 through f21 

entities that engage in trading activities that exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital to account for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comerica’s trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica adjusts its riskweighted assets to account for market risk as required 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries like other bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio minimum tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 45 percent 6 percent and 8 percent of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively comerica and its bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 25 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses comerica and its bank subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted average total assets of 4 percent 

to be well capitalized comerica’s bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a total capital ratio tier 1 capital ratio cet1 capital ratio and a leverage ratio equal to at least 100 percent 80 percent 65 percent and 50 percent respectively for purposes of the frb’s regulation y including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company bank holding companies such as comerica must maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 60 percent and a total capital ratio of at least 100 percent to be well capitalized the frb may require bank holding companies including comerica to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition risk profile and growth plans 

failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators including restrictions on comerica’s or its bank subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on growth 

at december 31 2020 comerica met all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable well capitalized requirements as shown in the table below 



additional information on the calculation of comerica’s and its bank subsidiaries’ cet1 capital tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f19 through f21 of the financial section 

of this report and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f96 through f98 of the financial section of this report 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

as of december 31 2020 each of comerica’s bank subsidiaries’ capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapitalbased safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

dividends 

comerica incorporated is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries since comerica’s consolidated net income and liquidity consists largely of net income of and dividends received from comerica’s bank subsidiaries comerica’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon its receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below no assurances can be given that comerica’s bank subsidiaries will in any circumstances pay dividends to comerica 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2021 comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 12 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 498 million in 2020 12 billion in 2019 and 11 billion in 2018 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries must maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of 25 to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends 

furthermore federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia “prompt corrective action” regime discussed above which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

frb supervisory guidance generally provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless 1 the bank holding company’s net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid is sufficient to fully fund the dividends 2 the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and 3 the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios the supervisory guidance also provides that a bank holding company should inform the frb reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being 

paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company’s capital structure bank holding companies also are required to consult with the frb before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments including common stock or materially increasing dividends 

transactions with affiliates 

federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comerica’s affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate including financial subsidiaries to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include i a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate ii a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate iii a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate iv the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan v the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and vi securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders 

data privacy and cybersecurity regulation 

comerica is subject to many us federal us state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data privacy protection which require among other things maintaining policies and procedures to protect the nonpublic confidential information of customers and employees the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica and its subsidiaries from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state levels limit comerica’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information because we have a limited presence in new york we are subject to certain requirements of the new york department of financial service’s cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies which include maintaining a cybersecurity program and policies and breach notification requirements 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions including comerica and their thirdparty service providers the proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector comerica continues to monitor the development of this rule 

data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including an exemption applicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the california attorney general adopted regulations implementing the ccpa on august 14 2020 comerica has a physical footprint in california and is required to comply with the ccpa in addition similar laws may be adopted by other states where comerica does business the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation 

like other lenders comerica bank and other of comerica’s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act “fcra” and the fcra also regulates reporting 

information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on comerica and its subsidiaries 

fdic insurance assessments 

the dif provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to 250000 per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2020 comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 33 million 

antimoney laundering regulations 

comerica is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering terrorist financing and transactions with persons companies or foreign governments designated by us authorities aml laws this category of laws includes the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act and the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 or usa patriot act 

the aml laws and their implementing regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the aml laws and their regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the office of foreign assets control “ofac” is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include 1 restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and 2 a blocking of assets in which the government or “specially designated nationals” of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 percent the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations the frb may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bank holding company’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements comerica may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress capital loans by comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks in the event of comerica’s bankruptcy any commitment by comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary banks would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

supervisory and enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad supervisory and enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to conduct examinations and investigations impose nonpublic supervisory agreements issue cease and desist orders terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties bank regulators regularly examine the operations of bank holding companies and banks and the results of these examinations as well as certain supervisory and enforcement actions are confidential and may not be made public 

resolution plans 

as a depository institution with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets comerica bank is required to periodically file a resolution plan with the fdic on april 16 2019 the fdic released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” with respect to the fdic’s bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size complexity and risk profile the anpr offers two alternative approaches to resolution planning for commenters to consider and solicits comment on how to tailor the requirements of the rule to reflect differences in size complexity and other factors among the population of large insured depository institutions and on whether to increase the current threshold of 50 billion in assets that triggers application of the rule 

incentivebased compensation 

comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica it is comerica’s intent to continue monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation practices 

in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

the volcker rule 

comerica is prohibited under the volcker rule from 1 engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for its own account and 2 having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting and trading in us government and agency obligations and permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities 

comerica has compliance programs required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in covered funds additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments which includes the covered funds is set forth in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f55 of the financial section of this report 

in october 2019 the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule finalized changes designed to simplify compliance with the volcker rule the final rule formalized a threetiered approach to compliance program requirements for banking entities based on their level of trading activity as a banking entity with “moderate” trading assets and liabilities less than 20 billion comerica is subject to simplified compliance requirements in june 2020 regulators finalized a rule further modifying the volcker rule’s prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds the final rule modifies three areas of the rule by streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address comerica continues to follow volcker rule developments 

derivative transactions 

as a state member bank comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable texas and federal law title vii of the doddfrank act contains a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements do not impact comerica directly since comerica bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or major swap participant comerica continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly on november 5 2018 the cftc issued a final rule that sets the permanent aggregate gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis exception from the definition of swap dealer at 8 billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding 12 months comericas swap dealing activities are currently below this threshold 

the initial margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps will be effective for comerica’s swap and securitybased swap counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants on september 1 2022 at which time such counterparties will be required to collect initial margin from comerica the initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity comerica is currently working toward meeting compliance with the initial margin requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau and certain recent consumer finance regulations 

comerica is subject to regulation by the cfpb which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets including comerica bank and their depositary affiliates

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

• people including the competence integrity and succession planning of customers 

• purpose the legal logical and productive purposes of the credit facility 

• payment including the source timing and probability of payment

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “contemplates” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” “opportunity” “initiative” “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” “on track” “trend” “objective” “looks forward” “projects” “models” and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

credit risk 

• unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect comericas financial results 

although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances as occurred in 2020 during the covid19 pandemic comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

• declines in the businesses or industries of comericas customers  in particular the energy industry  could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances which could adversely affect comerica 

comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive commercial real estate residential real estate and energy industries these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of these businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan 

in pa rticular in 2020 energy markets which were already experiencing stress prior to the pandemic were further impacted by the rapid decline in demand resulting from social distancing policies energy prices and demand improved in the latter half of 2020 as the economy began to recover but energy markets remain uncertain loans in the energy business line were 16 billion or approximately 3 percent of total loans at december 31 2020 at december 31 2020 the reserve allocation for energy loans was approximately 8 percent of the energy portfolio if oil and gas prices continue to remain depressed for a prolonged period of time comericas energy portfolio could experience increased credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results furthermore a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the texas economy which could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding comericas energy portfolio please see “energy lending” beginning on pages f31 through f32 of this report 

for more information regarding certain of comericas other lines of business please see concentrations of credit risk commercial real estate lending automotive lending dealer automotive lending production and residential real estate lending on pages f29 through f31 of the financial section of this report 

additionally certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic such as retail commercial real estate retail goods and services hotels artsrecreation airlines restaurants and bars childcare coffee shops cruise lines education gasoline and convenience stores religious organizations senior living freight and travel 

arrangements and comerica has outstanding loans to clients in these industries as described below under other sectors most at risk due to economic stress resulting from covid19 impacts on page f32 of the financial section of this report 

• changes in customer behavior due to outside factors may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as pandemics fuel prices energy costs tariffs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

market risk 

• governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry and therefore impact comericas financial condition and results of operations 

monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates such as decreases in the federal funds rate in 2020 or changes in the frbs balance sheet influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

• fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect comericas net interest income and balance sheet 

the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions and the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities the federal reserve lowered interest rates significantly in 2020 a continued low interest rate environment will adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f33 of the financial section of this report 

deposits make up a large portion of comerica’s funding portfolio comericas funding costs may increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs will reduce comericas net interest margin and net interest income 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

• interest rates on comericas outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely affect its revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 comerica has substantial exposure to liborbased products including loans securities derivatives and hedges and comerica and the banking industry are preparing to transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates comerica began indexing new retail adjustable rate mortgages to sofr secured overnight financing rate in third quarter 2020 during fourth quarter 2020 comerica began the process of incorporating fallback language in legacy liborbased commercial loans and updated international swaps and derivative association isda protocols in interest rate derivatives comerica continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates including recent 

announcements from the ice benchmark administrator to extend the cessation date for several usd libor tenors to june 30 2023 as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition 

the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenues and expenses associated with comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s historical role in determining market interest rates globally 

• adversely affect the value of comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s historical role in determining market interest rates globally 

• prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to comerica’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and 

• require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition comerica’s risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr 

approximately 73 percent of comericas loans at december 31 2020 were tied to libor which excludes the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed more information regarding the libor transition is available on pages f34 through f35 under libor transition 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on comerica’s funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

liquidity risk 

• comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities 

comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition based on interest rates which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

• reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect comerica andor the holders of its securities 

rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in march 2020 sp global ratings revised each of comerica incorporated and comerica banks outlook from stable to “negative” and in april 2020 fitch ratings downgraded comerica incorporated and comerica banks longterm issuer default ratings by one notch from a to a while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on 

comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

• the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica 

comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be monetized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica 

technology risk 

• comerica faces security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting comerica’s colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect its business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure 

comerica’s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which comerica is highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft comerica’s business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access comerica’s network products and services its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

cyber attacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in comericas systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems as cyber threats continue to evolve comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of comerica’s systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss 

although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner 

cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at comerica or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on comerica’s systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause comerica serious negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with 

maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to comerica’s operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of its confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of its customers or damage to comerica’s or comerica’s customers’ andor third parties’ computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in comerica’s security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact its results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition although comerica maintains insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber losses subject to policy terms and conditions we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event 

• cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus 

as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including comerica and its bank subsidiaries and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica receives maintains and stores nonpublic personal information of comerica’s customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds including comerica for more information regarding data privacy regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information comerica may store or maintain comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with comerica’s current practices it may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts comerica’s operating results 

operational risk 

• comerica’s operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt comerica’s business and adversely impact comerica’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm 

the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout comerica’s business and as a result of its interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to comerica’s own internal operational functions comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies as well as the increase in remote work due to the covid19 pandemic can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica relies on its employees and third parties in its daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of comerica’s or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose comerica to risk for example comerica’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to comerica or to third parties with whom comerica interacts or upon whom it relies although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss 

of customer data in addition comerica’s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems 

comerica’s financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume andor customer activity electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics cyber attacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

• comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its delivery systems and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations 

comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services card processing services and trust processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

• legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry including those directly involving comerica and its subsidiaries could adversely affect comerica or the financial services industry in general 

comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

• comerica may incur losses due to fraud 

fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving examples include but are not limited to debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials employee fraud information theft and other malfeasance increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity comerica continues to invest in systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future 

• controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports comerica files or submits under the exchange act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met due to certain inherent limitations these limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented accordingly because of the inherent limitations in control systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

compliance risk 

• changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations 

comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the occ the cfpb the cftc the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations and ability to make acquisitions investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations it is too soon for comerica to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur as a result of the change in leadership resulting from the recent elections or if changes occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

• compliance with stringent capital requirements may adversely affect comerica 

comerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards as set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

• tax regulations could be subject to potential legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations 

federal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified andor modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica either directly or indirectly as a result of effects on comericas customers for example the current administration has indicated it may propose increases to the federal corporate statutory tax rate an increase in the federal corporate tax rate may increase comerica’s tax provision expense we are unable to predict whether these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 

strategic risk 

• damage to comerica’s reputation could damage its businesses 

reputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

• comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services to its customers 

the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer 

satisfaction as well the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

• competitive product and pricing pressures within comericas markets may change 

comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation customer convenience quality customer service and responsiveness to customer needs and the overall relationship with our clients our competitors are large national and regional financial institutions as well as smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer 

additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• the introduction implementation withdrawal success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated which could adversely affect comericas business 

comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

• managements ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations 

the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

• managements ability to retain key officers and employees may change 

comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be 

only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

• any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to comericas business and operations 

difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of any acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica would be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

general risk 

• the covid19 pandemic has and will likely continue to adversely impact our business and the ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains lowered equity market valuations created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increased unemployment levels in addition the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities as a result the demand for our products and services has been and is expected to continue to be significantly impacted furthermore the pandemic has influenced and could further influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and has increased and could further increase our allowance for credit losses particularly as some businesses remain closed or are forced to close again and as more customers may draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic such as retail commercial real estate retail goods and services hotels artsrecreation airlines restaurants and bars childcare coffee shops cruise lines education gasoline and convenience stores religious organizations senior living freight and travel arrangements and comerica has outstanding loans to clients in these industries as described below under other sectors most at risk due to economic stress resulting from covid19 impacts on page f32 similarly because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers the securities we hold may lose value we have temporarily closed andor limited access to certain of our branches and offices or may do so in the future and our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively longterm including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic in response to the pandemic we have also enacted hardship relief assistance for customers experiencing financial difficulty as a result of covid19 including fee and penalty waivers loan deferrals or other scenarios that may help our customers as of december 31 2020 pandemicrelated payment deferrals totaled 141 million 

representing approximately 100 obligors and consisting of 42 percent commercial loans and 58 percent retail loans primarily residential mortgages 

as well we are a lender for the small business administrations paycheck protection program ppp and other sba federal reserve or united states treasury programs that have been or may be created in the future in response to the pandemic these programs are new and their effects on comericas business are uncertain the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic 

• general political economic or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may be less favorable than expected 

local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the economic environment and market conditions in which comerica operates continue to be uncertain the us economy contracted into a recession with unusual speed and force in the first half of 2020 ending the longest expansionary period in us history the us government and the federal reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures in addition to the federal reserve reducing the target federal funds rate to zero to 025 percent congress passed the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act that included an estimated 2 trillion stimulus package although the us economy began to recover in third quarter 2020 as social distancing policies loosened economic metrics in fourth quarter 2020 indicate an uneven path to recovery in december 2020 congress amended the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act with the consolidated appropriations act of 2021 to provide an additional 900 billion of stimulus relief to mitigate the continued impacts of the pandemic while certain factors point to improving economic conditions uncertainty remains regarding the path of the economic recovery the mitigating impacts of government interventions the success of vaccine distribution and the efficacy of administered vaccines as well as the effects of the change in leadership resulting from the recent elections conditions related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts changes in trade policies and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica 

• methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective 

instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity technology operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

for more information regarding risk management please see risk management on pages f22 through f38 of the financial section of this report 

• catastrophic events may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and comerica 

acts of terrorism cyberterrorism political unrest war civil disturbance armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities natural disasters including tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods global health risks or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events could have a negative impact on us comerica’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

in particular certain of the regions where comerica operates including california texas and florida are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change these types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies comericas business and customers and have caused physical damage to comericas property in these regions 

further catastrophic events may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica 

in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on 

comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

• changes in accounting standards could materially impact comericas financial statements 

from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comerica’s financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

• comericas accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain 

accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f39 through f43 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f52 through f64 of the financial section of this report 

• comericas stock price can be volatile 

stock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive comericas stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

• actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations 

• recommendations or projections by securities analysts 

• operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to comerica 

• news reports relating to trends concerns and other issues in the financial services industry 

• perceptions in the marketplace regarding comerica andor its competitors 

• new technology used or services offered by competitors 

• significant acquisitions or business combinations strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving comerica or its competitors 

• changes in dividends and capital returns 

• changes in government regulations 

• cyclical fluctuations 

• geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 

• activity by short sellers and changing government restrictions on such activity 

general market fluctuations including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economy industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes oil price volatility or credit loss trends among other factors could also cause comericas stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 

for the above and other reasons the market price of comericas securities may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the securities and investors should consider this before relying on the market prices of comericas securities when making an investment decision

 item 1 business 

general 

comerica incorporated “comerica” is a financial services company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1973 and headquartered in dallas texas based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies fr y9c it was among the 25 largest commercial united states “us” financial holding companies as of december 31 2019  comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2 active banking subsidiaries comerica bank a texas banking association and comerica bank  trust national association and 29 nonbanking subsidiaries at december 31 2019  comerica had total assets of approximately 734 billion  total deposits of approximately 573 billion  total loans of approximately 504 billion and shareholders’ equity of approximately 73 billion  

comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the business bank the retail bank and wealth management in addition to the three major business segments finance is also reported as a segment 

comerica operates in three primary geographic markets  texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida with select businesses operating in several other states and in canada and mexico 

we provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services 1 under the caption “analysis of net interest income” on page f6 of the financial section of this report 2 under the caption “ratevolume analysis” on page f7 of the financial section of this report and 3 under the caption “noninterest income” on pages f8 through f9 of the financial section of this report 

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation commercial loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while potentially strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system furthermore given that comerica bank is a bank with assets in excess of 10 billion dollars it is subject to supervision and regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial laws the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law and therefore comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each also subject to regulation and examination by the fdic certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” the department of labor “dol” regulates financial institutions providing services to plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 comerica bank’s canada branch is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and its mexico representative office is supervised by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” the department of licensing and regulatory affairs of the state of michigan and the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” in the case of comerica securities inc the department of insurance and financial services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc the dol in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc and world asset management inc 

both the scope of the laws and regulations and intensity of supervision to which comerica’s business is subject have increased over the past decade in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place in 2018 with the passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as described below there has been some recalibration of the postfinancial crisis framework however comerica’s business remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision 

comerica is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as well as the rules of the new york stock exchange 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act 

on may 24 2018 egrrcpa was signed into law among other regulatory changes egrrcpa amends various sections of the doddfrank act including section 165 of doddfrank act which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies under egrrcpa bank holding companies with less than 100 billion of consolidated assets including comerica were immediately exempted from all of the enhanced prudential standards except risk committee requirements which now apply to publiclytraded bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of consolidated assets including comerica as a result comerica is no longer subject to doddfrank act supervisory and companyrun stress testing required to file a resolution plan under section 165d of the doddfrank act or subject to internal liquidity stress testing and buffer requirements in addition comerica is no longer required to pay the supervision and regulation fee assessment under the doddfrank act 

on july 6 2018 the frb released a statement that for bank holding companies with between 50 billion and 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica the frb would take no action to require such bank holding companies to comply with the comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process or the liquidity coverage ratio pursuant to an frb rule finalized on october 10 2019 bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets are now exempt 

banks with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica bank are also exempt from companyrun stress testing requirements under the egrrcpa 

requirements for approval of activities and acquisitions 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements described below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb determines in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 

in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company comerica and each of its depository institution subsidiaries must each remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” and comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if comerica or any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

in addition the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica bank’s current rating under the cra is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies in many cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including whether comerica and its subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed are in compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations or have cra ratings of less than “satisfactory” 

acquisitions of ownership of comerica 

acquisitions of comerica’s voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws including the bank holding company act of 1956 and the change in bank control act of 1978 under the change in bank control act a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the frb before acquiring the power to vote 10 or more of comerica’s outstanding common stock investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of comerica’s stock 

capital and liquidity 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ in calculating riskbased capital requirements a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses on july 22 2019 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that simplifies certain regulatory capital rules including the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests in addition in december 2018 the federal banking regulators adopted rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase in for regulatory capital purposes the dayone impact of the new current expected credit loss cecl accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years comerica does not anticipate to elect this deferral as the transition impact to retained earnings is not expected to be significant more information is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f17 through f19 

entities that engage in trading activities that exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital to account for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comerica’s trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica adjusts its riskweighted assets to account for market risk as required 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries like other bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio minimum tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 45 percent 6 percent and 8 percent of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively comerica and its bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 25 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses comerica and its bank subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted average total assets of 4 percent 

to be well capitalized comerica’s bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a total capital ratio tier 1 capital ratio cet1 capital ratio and a leverage ratio equal to at least 100 percent 80 percent 65 percent and 50 percent respectively for purposes of the frb’s regulation y including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company bank holding companies such as comerica must maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 60 percent and a total capital ratio of at least 100 percent to be well capitalized the frb may require bank holding companies including comerica to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition risk profile and growth plans 

failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators including restrictions on comerica’s or its bank subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on growth 

at december 31 2019  comerica met all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements plus the applicable countercyclical conservation buffer and the applicable well capitalized requirements as shown in the table below 

on november 1 2019 the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that revises the framework for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and standardized liquidity requirements for large us banking organizations the us intermediate holding companies of certain foreign banking organizations and certain of their depository institution subsidiaries under the final rule the liquidity coverage ratio and certain capital requirements no longer apply to banking organizations with total consolidated assets of between 50 billion and 100 billion including comerica 

additional information on the calculation of comerica’s and its bank subsidiaries’ cet1 capital tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f17 through f19 of the financial section 

of this report and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f90 through f92 of the financial section of this report 

annual capital plans and stress tests 

comerica was previously subject to the frb’s annual ccar process including the requirement to submit an annual capital plan to the frb for nonobjection however on october 10 2019 the frb finalized a rule that exempts bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets from these requirements 

comerica was also previously subject to doddfrank act stress testing requirements as discussed above as a bank holding company with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets comerica was immediately exempted from doddfrank act supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements by the egrrcpa 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

as of december 31 2019  each of comerica’s bank subsidiaries’ capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapitalbased safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries since comerica’s consolidated net income and liquidity consists largely of net income of and dividends received from comerica’s bank subsidiaries comerica’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon its receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below no assurances can be given that comerica’s bank subsidiaries will in any circumstances pay dividends to comerica 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2020  comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 98 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 12 billion in 2019  11 billion in 2018 and 907 million in 2017  

comerica and its bank subsidiaries must maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of 25 to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends 

furthermore federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia “prompt corrective action” regime discussed above which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount 

of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

frb policy provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless 1 the bank holding company’s net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid is sufficient to fully fund the dividends 2 the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and 3 the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios the policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the frb reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company’s capital structure bank holding companies also are required to consult with the frb before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments including common stock or materially increasing dividends 

transactions with affiliates 

federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comerica’s affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate including financial subsidiaries to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include i a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate ii a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate iii a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate iv the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan v the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and vi securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders 

data privacy and cybersecurity regulation 

comerica is subject to many us federal us state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data privacy protection which require among other things maintaining policies and procedures to protect the nonpublic confidential information of customers and employees the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica and its subsidiaries from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state levels limit comerica’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information because we have a limited presence in new york we are subject to certain requirements of the new york department of financial service’s cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies which include maintaining a cybersecurity program and policies and breach notification requirements 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions including comerica and their thirdparty service providers the proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector comerica continues to monitor the development of this rule 

data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including an exemption applicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the california attorney general has proposed but not yet adopted 

regulations implementing the ccpa and the california state legislature has amended the act since its passage comerica has a physical footprint in california and will be required to comply with the ccpa in addition similar laws may be adopted by other states where comerica does business the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation 

like other lenders comerica bank and other of comerica’s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act “fcra” and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on comerica and its subsidiaries 

fdic insurance assessments 

the dif provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to 250000 per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2019  comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 23 million  

antimoney laundering regulations 

comerica is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering terrorist financing and transactions with persons companies or foreign governments designated by us authorities aml laws this category of laws includes the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act and the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001 or usa patriot act 

the aml laws and their implementing regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the aml laws and their regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the office of foreign assets control “ofac” is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include 1 restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and 2 a blocking of assets in which the government or “specially designated nationals” of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 percent the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations the frb may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bank holding company’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements comerica may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress capital loans by comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks in the event of comerica’s bankruptcy any commitment by comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary banks would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

supervisory and enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad supervisory and enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to conduct examinations and investigations impose nonpublic supervisory agreements issue cease and desist orders terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties bank regulators regularly examine the operations of bank holding companies and banks and the results of these examinations as well as certain supervisory and enforcement actions are confidential and may not be made public 

resolution plans 

before the enactment of egrrcpa comerica was required to prepare and submit a resolution plan to the frb and fdic as discussed above pursuant to egrrcpa comerica is now exempt from this requirement as a bank holding company with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets 

egrrcpa did not change the fdic’s rules that require depository institutions with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets including comerica bank to periodically file a separate resolution plan on april 16 2019 the fdic released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking “anpr” with respect to the fdic’s bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size complexity and risk profile the anpr offers two alternative approaches to resolution planning for commenters to consider and solicits comment on how to tailor the requirements of the rule to reflect differences in size complexity and other factors among the population of large insured depository institutions and on whether to increase the current threshold of 50 billion in assets that triggers application of the rule 

incentivebased compensation 

comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica it is comerica’s intent to continue monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation practices 

in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

the volcker rule 

comerica is prohibited under the volcker rule from 1 engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for its own account and 2 having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting and trading in us government and agency obligations and permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities 

comerica has compliance programs required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in covered funds additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments which includes the covered funds is set forth in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f48 of the financial section of this report 

in october 2019 the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule finalized changes designed to simplify compliance with the volcker rule the final rule formalized a threetiered approach to compliance program requirements for banking entities based on their level of trading activity as a banking entity with “moderate” trading assets and liabilities less than 20 billion comerica is now subject to simplified compliance requirements additionally in january 2020 regulators proposed changes to modify the volcker rule’s restrictions on covered funds comerica continues to follow volcker rule developments 

derivative transactions 

as a state member bank comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable texas and federal law title vii of the doddfrank act contains a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements do not impact comerica directly since comerica bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or “major swap participant” comerica continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly on november 5 2018 the cftc issued a final rule that sets the permanent aggregate 

gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis exception from the definition of swap dealer at 8 billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding 12 months comericas swap dealing activities are currently below this threshold 

the initial margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps will be effective for comerica’s swap and securitybased swap counterparties that are swap dealers on september 1 2021 at which time such counterparties will be required to collect initial margin from comerica the initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity comerica is currently working toward meeting compliance with the initial margin requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau and certain recent consumer finance regulations 

comerica is subject to regulation by the cfpb which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets including comerica bank and their depositary affiliates 

comerica is also subject to certain state consumer protection laws and under the doddfrank act state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations in recent years state authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules these federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of comerica’s activities and to various aspects of its business and include laws relating to interest rates fair lending disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers debt collection practices the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies and the prohibition of unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer sale or provision of consumer financial products and services 

flood insurance rules

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit approval and monitoring 

approval of new loan exposure and oversight and monitoring of comericas loan portfolio is the joint responsibility of the credit risk management and decisioning department and the credit underwriting department collectively referred to as “credit” plus the business units “line” credit assists the line with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral the approval of new loan exposure is the joint responsibility of credit risk management and decisioning and the line each commercial borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit risk management and decisioning further credit updates the assigned internal risk rating as new information becomes available as a result of periodic reviews of credit quality a change in borrower performance or approval of new loan exposure the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to support comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future 

losses and price the loans appropriately for risk finally the line and credit including its portfolio risk analytics department work together to insure the overall credit risk within the loan portfolio is consistent with the bank’s credit risk appetite 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide line and credit personnel with a framework of sound underwriting practices and potential loan structures these credit policies also provide the framework for loan committee approval authorities based on its internal riskrating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit in conjunction with the line monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprised of senior credit market and risk management executives

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “contemplates” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” “opportunity” “initiative” “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” “on track” “trend” “objective” “looks forward” “projects” “models” and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

credit risk 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive commercial real estate residential real estate and energy industries these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of these businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan 

for more information regarding certain of comericas lines of business please see concentration of credit risk automotive lending commercial real estate lending residential real estate lending and “energy lending” on pages f25 through f27 of the financial section of this report 

 individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs tariffs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

recently there have been discussions regarding potential changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed on october 1 2018 the united states canada and mexico agreed to a new trade deal the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca to replace the north american free trade agreement the usmca subject to congressional approval passed the house of representatives on december 19 2019 and the senate on january 16 2020 the trade deal was signed by president trump on january 29 2020 these and any other changes in tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that comerica’s customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce customer margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt in turn this could adversely affect comerica’s financial condition and results of operations 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

market risk 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates such as recent decreases in the federal funds rate or changes in the frbs balance sheet will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions and the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities the federal reserve lowered interest rates three times in 2019 a continued low interest rate environment could adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f28 of the financial section of this report 

deposits make up a large portion of comerica’s funding portfolio comericas funding costs may continue to increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs will reduce comericas net interest margin and net interest income 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next two years the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of us financial market participants selected and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight finance rate “sofr” as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight us treasury repo market and differs from libor in key respects at this time while it is expected that sofr will be the successor to libor it is possible that another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to libor 

the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate including sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenues and expenses associated with comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s role in determining market interest rates globally 

• adversely affect the value of comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s role in determining market interest rates globally 

• prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to comerica’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and 

• require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition comerica’s risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr 

approximately 75 of comericas loans at december 31 2019 were tied to libor which excludes the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed more information regarding the libor transition is available on page f29 under libor transition 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on comerica’s funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

liquidity risk 

 comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition based on interest rates which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in december 2019 fitch ratings revised each of comerica incorporated and comerica banks outlook from stable to “negative” while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica 

technology risk 

 comerica’s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which comerica is highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft comerica’s business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access comerica’s network products and services its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

cyber attacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in comericas systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems as cyber threats continue to evolve comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of comerica’s systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss 

although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner 

cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at comerica or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on comerica’s systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause comerica serious negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to comerica’s operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of its confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of its customers or damage to comerica’s or comerica’s customers’ andor third parties’ computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in comerica’s security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact its results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition comerica may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event 

• cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus 

as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including comerica and its bank subsidiaries and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica receives maintains and stores nonpublic personal information of comerica’s customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds including comerica for more information regarding data privacy regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information comerica may store or maintain comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with comerica’s current practices it may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts comerica’s operating results 

operational risk 

 the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout comerica’s business and as a result of its interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to comerica’s own internal operational functions comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica relies on its employees and third parties in its daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of comerica’s or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose comerica to risk for example comerica’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to comerica or to third parties with whom comerica interacts or upon whom it relies although comerica 

has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data in addition comerica’s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems 

comerica’s financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume andor customer activity electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics cyber attacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

 comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services card processing services and trust processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving examples include but are not limited to debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials employee fraud information theft and other malfeasance increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity comerica continues to invest in systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future 

 controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports comerica files or submits under the exchange act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met due to certain inherent limitations these limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented accordingly because of the inherent limitations in control systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

compliance risk 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the occ the cfpb the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations and ability to make acquisitions investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations 

 comerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards as set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 federal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified andor modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica either directly or indirectly as a result of effects on comericas customers for example the tax reform bill enacted on december 22 2017 has had and is expected to continue to have farreaching and significant effects on comerica its customers and the us economy 

financial reporting risk 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comerica’s financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings in particular the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has issued a new accounting standard cecl for the recognition and measurement of credit losses for loans and debt securities the new standard will be effective for comerica in the first quarter 2020 the anticipated change in loan loss reserves due to cecl is approximately a 17 million decrease to comericas credit loss reserves at adoption as well as a corresponding increase to retained earnings of 13 million and a decrease of 4 million to deferred tax assets 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f34 through f36 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f45 through f57 of the financial section of this report 

strategic risk 

 reputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as well the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer 

additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of any acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica would be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica

 local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the economic environment and market conditions in which comerica operates continue to be uncertain while many us economic indicators at the end of 2019 were positive and consistent with an ongoing economic expansion activity in the us manufacturing sector slowed and trade policy and weak global demand remained major sources of uncertainty for businesses and markets conditions related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts changes in trade policies and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity technology operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations

in particular certain of the regions where comerica operates including california texas and florida are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change these types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies comericas business and customers and have caused physical damage to comericas property in these regions 

further catastrophic events may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica 

in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 stock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive comericas stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 



 general market fluctuations including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economy industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes oil price volatility or credit loss trends among other factors could also cause comericas stock price to decrease regardless of operating results

 item 1 business 

general 

comerica incorporated “comerica” is a financial services company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and headquartered in dallas texas based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies fr y9c it was among the 25 largest commercial united states “us” financial holding companies comerica was formed in 1973 to acquire the outstanding common stock of comerica bank which at such time was a michigan banking corporation and one of michigans oldest banks formerly comerica bankdetroit on october 31 2007 comerica bank a michigan banking corporation was merged with and into comerica bank a texas banking association “comerica bank” as of december 31 2018  comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2  active banking and 29  nonbanking subsidiaries at december 31 2018  comerica had total assets of approximately 708 billion  total deposits of approximately 556 billion  total loans net of unearned income of approximately 502 billion  and shareholders’ equity of approximately 75 billion  

comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the business bank the retail bank and wealth management in addition to the three major business segments finance is also reported as a segment 

comerica operates in three primary geographic markets  texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida with select businesses operating in several other states and in canada and mexico 

we provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services 1 under the caption “analysis of net interest income” on page f6 of the financial section of this report 2 under the caption “net interest income” on page f7 of the financial section of this report and 3 under the caption “noninterest income” on pages f8 through f9 of the financial section of this report 

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law and therefore comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each also subject to regulation and examination by the fdic certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” the department of labor “dol” regulates financial institutions providing services to plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 comerica bank’s canada branch is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and its mexico representative office is supervised by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority inc “finra” the department of licensing and regulatory affairs of the state of michigan and the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” in the case of comerica securities inc the department of insurance and financial services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc the dol in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc and world asset management inc 

both the scope of the laws and regulations and intensity of supervision to which comerica’s business is subject have increased over the past decade in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place in 2018 with the passage of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act “egrrcpa” as described below there has been some recalibration of the postfinancial crisis framework however comerica’s business remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision 

comerica is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended both as administered by the sec as well as the rules of the new york stock exchange 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act   

on may 24 2018 egrrcpa was signed into law among other regulatory changes egrrcpa amends various sections of the doddfrank act including section 165 of doddfrank act which was revised to raise the asset thresholds for determining the application of enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies under egrrcpa bank holding companies with less than 100 billion of consolidated assets including comerica were immediately exempted from all of the enhanced prudential standards except risk committee requirements which now apply to publiclytraded bank holding companies with 50 billion or more of consolidated assets including comerica as a result comerica is no longer subject to doddfrank act supervisory and companyrun stress testing required to file a resolution plan under section 165d of the doddfrank act or subject to internal liquidity stress testing and buffer requirements in addition comerica is no longer required to pay the supervision and regulation fee assessment under the doddfrank act 

on july 6 2018 the frb released a statement that for bank holding companies with between 50 billion and 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica the frb would take no action to require such bank holding companies to comply with the comprehensive capital analysis and review “ccar” process or the liquidity coverage ratio on october 31 2018 the frb proposed rules that would revise its regulations to raise the asset thresholds for these requirements so that bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets would be exempt 

also on july 6 2018 the federal banking regulators issued an interagency statement that banks with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica bank would not be required to comply with companyrun stress testing requirements until november 25 2019 at which time such banks will become exempt from companyrun stress testing requirements 

under the egrrcpa in addition the federal banking regulators have each issued proposed rules that would revise their stress testing regulations consistent with the egrrcpa 

requirements for approval of activities and acquisitions 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements described below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb determines in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity “complementary activities” are activities that the frb determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 

in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company comerica and each of its depository institution subsidiaries must each remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” and comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if comerica or any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

in addition the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica bank’s current rating under the cra is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies in many cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including whether comerica and its subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed are in compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations or have cra ratings of less than “satisfactory” 

acquisitions of ownership of comerica 

acquisitions of comerica’s voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws including the bank holding company act of 1956 and the change in bank control act of 1978 under the change in bank control act a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the frb before acquiring the power to vote 10 or more of comerica’s outstanding common stock investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of comerica’s stock 

capital and liquidity 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ in calculating riskbased capital requirements a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses the ultimate treatment for certain specific deductions and adjustments is yet to be determined pending the finalization of a proposal by banking regulators to simplify certain aspects of the capital rules in addition in december 2018 the federal banking regulators adopted rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase in for regulatory capital purposes the dayone impact of the new current expected credit loss cecl accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years more information is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f18 through f20 

entities that engage in trading activities that exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital to account for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comerica’s trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica adjusts its riskweighted assets to account for market risk as required 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries like other bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio minimum tier 1 capital ratio and minimum total capital ratio equal to at least 45 percent 6 percent and 8 percent of their total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively in 2018 comerica and its bank subsidiaries were also required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 1875 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses the minimum required capital conservation buffer increased to 25 percent as of january 1 2019 comerica and its bank subsidiaries are also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted average total assets of 4 percent 

to be well capitalized comerica’s bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a cet1 capital ratio tier 1 capital ratio total capital ratio and a leverage ratio equal to at least 65 percent 80 percent 100 percent and 50 percent respectively the frb has not yet revised the minimum requirements for bank holding companies to be considered well capitalized to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules for purposes of the frb’s regulation y including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company bank holding companies such as comerica must maintain a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 60 percent and a total capital ratio of at least 100 percent to be well capitalized if the frb were to apply the same or a very similar minimum requirement to be considered well capitalized to bank holding companies as that applicable to comerica’s bank subsidiaries comerica’s capital ratios as of december 31 2018 would exceed such revised minimum requirements the frb may require bank holding companies including comerica to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition risk profile and growth plans 

failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators including restrictions on comerica’s or its bank subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on growth 

at december 31 2018 comerica met all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements plus the applicable countercyclical conservation buffer and the applicable well capitalized requirements as shown in the table below 

comerica was previously required to comply with the modified liquidity coverage ratio and would have been required to comply with the proposed net stable funding ratio however as discussed above the frb has stated that it will take no action to require bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica to comply with 

the modified liquidity coverage ratio in addition the banking regulators proposed a rule on october 31 2018 that would raise the asset threshold for the proposed net stable funding ratio rule to apply to firms with more than 100 billion in total consolidated assets and therefore comerica would not be required to comply with this rule as currently proposed 

additional information on the calculation of comerica’s and its bank subsidiaries’ cet1 capital tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in the “capital” section located on pages f18 through f20 of the financial section of this report and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f92 through f93 of the financial section of this report 

annual capital plans and stress tests 

comerica was previously subject to the frb’s annual ccar process including the requirement to submit an annual capital plan to the frb for nonobjection however as discussed above the frb has stated that it will take no action to require bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets including comerica to comply with the requirements of the ccar process and on october 31 2018 the frb proposed rules that would revise its regulations to raise the asset thresholds for these requirements such that bank holding companies with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets would be exempt 

comerica and comerica bank were also previously subject to doddfrank act stress testing requirements as discussed above as a bank holding company with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets comerica was immediately exempted from doddfrank act supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements by the egrrcpa and comerica bank as a bank with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets will be exempt from companyrun stress testing requirements under the egrrcpa on november 25 2019 and will not be required to comply with them during the intervening period the federal banking regulators have proposed rules that would revise their respective regulations to raise the asset thresholds for these requirements such that bank holding companies and banks with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets would be exempt 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution 

as of december 31 2018  each of comerica’s bank subsidiaries’ capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapitalbased safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries since comerica’s consolidated net income and liquidity consists largely of net income of and dividends received from comerica’s bank subsidiaries comerica’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon its receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below no assurances can be given that comerica’s bank subsidiaries will in any circumstances pay dividends to comerica 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the 

preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2019  comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 108 million  from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 11 billion  in 2018  907 million  in 2017  and 545 million  in 2016  

comerica and its bank subsidiaries must maintain the applicable cet1 capital conservation buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends the capital conservation buffer is currently at its fully phasedin level of 25 

furthermore federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia “prompt corrective action” regime discussed above which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

frb policy provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless 1 the bank holding company’s net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid is sufficient to fully fund the dividends 2 the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and 3 the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios the policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the frb reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company’s capital structure bank holding companies also are required to consult with the frb before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments including common stock or materially increasing dividends

federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comerica’s affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate including financial subsidiaries to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include i a loan or extension of credit ii a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate iii a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate iv the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan v the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and vi securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders 

data privacy and cybersecurity regulation 

comerica is subject to many us federal us state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data privacy protection which require among other things maintaining policies and procedures to protect the nonpublic confidential information of customers and employees the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica and its subsidiaries from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state levels limit comerica’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information because we have a limited presence in new york we are subject to certain requirements of the new york department of financial service’s cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies which include maintaining a cybersecurity program and policies and breach notification requirements 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions including comerica and their thirdparty service providers the proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on 

cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa” the ccpa which becomes effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including an exemption applicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the california attorney general has not yet proposed or adopted regulations implementing the ccpa and the california state legislature has amended the act since its passage comerica has a physical footprint in california and will be required to comply with the ccpa in addition similar laws may be adopted by other states where comerica does business the impact of the ccpa on comerica’s business is yet to be determined the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation 

like other lenders comerica bank and other of comerica’s subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act “fcra” and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on comerica and its subsidiaries 

fdic insurance assessments 

the dif provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to 250000 per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2018  comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 42 million  including the dif surcharge that was in place from mid2016 until september 30 2018 for 2019 management expects a reduction in deposit insurance assessments of 16 million  as a result of the elimination of the dif surcharge 

antimoney laundering regulations 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

office of foreign assets control regulation 

the office of foreign assets control “ofac” is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include 1 restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and 2 a blocking of assets in which the government or “specially designated nationals” of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 percent the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations the frb may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bank holding company’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements comerica may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress capital loans by comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks in the event of comerica’s bankruptcy any commitment by comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary banks would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment 

similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution 

supervisory and enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad supervisory and enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to conduct examinations and investigations impose nonpublic supervisory agreements issue cease and desist orders terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties bank regulators regularly examine the operations of bank holding companies and banks and the results of these examinations as well as certain supervisory and enforcement actions are confidential and may not be made public 

resolution plans 

before the enactment of egrrcpa comerica was required to prepare and submit a resolution plan to the frb and fdic as discussed above pursuant to egrrcpa comerica is now exempt from this requirement as a bank holding company with less than 100 billion in total consolidated assets 

egrrcpa did not change the fdic’s rules that require depository institutions with 50 billion or more of total consolidated assets including comerica bank to periodically file a separate resolution plan the fdic’s chairman however has stated that the fdic intends to release an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the fdic’s bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firm’s size complexity and risk profile 

incentivebased compensation 

comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group 

have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica it is comerica’s intent to continue to evolve its incentive compensation processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation 

in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

the volcker rule   

comerica is prohibited under the volcker rule from 1 engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for its own account and 2 having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting and trading in us government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities 

comerica has put in place the compliance programs currently required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in covered funds additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments which includes the covered funds is set forth in note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f49 of the financial section of this report 

in may 2018 the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule released a proposal to revise the volcker rule the proposal would tailor the volcker rule’s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm’s trading activity revise the definition of trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and modify the information companies are required to provide the federal agencies comerica is following the development of this proposed rule 

derivative transactions 

as a state member bank comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable texas and federal law title vii of the doddfrank act contains a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements do not impact comerica directly since comerica bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or “major swap participant” comerica continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly on november 5 2018 the cftc issued a final rule that sets the permanent aggregate gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis  exception from the definition of swap dealer at 8 billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding 12 months comericas swap dealing activities are currently below this threshold 

the initial margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps will be effective for comerica’s swap and securitybased swap counterparties that are swap dealers on september 1 2020 at which time such counterparties will be required to collect initial margin from comerica the initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety 

and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity comerica is currently working toward meeting compliance with the initial margin requirements 

consumer financial protection bureau and certain recent consumer finance regulations 

comerica is subject to regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets including comerica bank and their depositary affliates 

comerica is also subject to certain state consumer protection laws and under the doddfrank act state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations in recent years state authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules these federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of comerica’s activities and to various aspects of its business and include laws relating to interest rates fair lending disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers debt collection practices the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies and the prohibition of unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer sale or provision of consumer financial products and services 

the cfpb has issued final rules changing the reporting requirements for lenders under the home mortgage disclosure act the new rules expand the range of transactions subject to these requirements to include most securitized residential mortgage loans and credit lines the rules also increase the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers comerica began collecting the expanded data on january 1 2018 

flood insurance rules 

comerica continues to monitor the development and implementation of the private flood insurance requirements to date the joint agencies have yet to issue a final rule with respect to this remaining requirement all other flood insurance requirements subject to the final rule  loans in areas having special flood hazards including the escrow of premium and fees for certain real estate loans are now effective and have been implemented by comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit approval and monitoring 

approval of new loan exposure and oversight and monitoring of comericas loan portfolio is the joint responsibility of the credit risk management and decisioning department and the credit underwriting department collectively referred to as “credit” plus the business units “line’ credit assists the line with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral the approval of new loan exposure is the joint responsibility of credit risk management and decisioning and the line each commercial borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit risk management and decisioning further credit updates the assigned internal risk rating as new information becomes available as a result of periodic reviews of credit quality a change in borrower performance or approval of new loan exposure the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to support comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future 

losses and price the loans appropriately for risk finally the line and credit including its portfolio risk analytics department work together to insure the overall credit risk within the loan portfolio is consistent with the bank’s credit risk appetite 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on its internal riskrating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit in conjunction with the line monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprised of senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio

 for additional information specific to our energy loan portfolio please see the caption “energy lending” on page f28    of the financial section of this report 

commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comericas cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes loans to real estate developers and investors and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comericas cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loan underwriting includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets as applicable after origination internal risk ratings are assigned based on payment status and product type 

comerica does not originate subprime loans although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue comerica generally considers subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustablerate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “contemplates” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” “opportunity” “initiative” “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” “on track” “trend” “objective” “looks forward” “projects” “models” and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov  or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the economic environment and market conditions in which comerica operates continue to be uncertain financial market volatility increased through the fourth quarter of 2018 also economic growth in the rest of the world appears to be slowing notably in china and in europe changes to us trade policy and reactions to changes by us trading partners have also increased stress on many us businesses most us economic indicators continue to be positive however some have shown signs of weakness through the end of 2018 this includes residential investment which has cooled as mortgage rates have increased conditions related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts changes in trade policies and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates such as recent increases in the federal funds rate or changes in the frbs balance sheet such as the frbs continuing balance sheet reduction will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received 

on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout comerica’s business and as a result of its interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to comerica’s own internal operational functions comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica relies on its employees and third parties in its daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of comerica’s or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose comerica to risk for example comerica’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to comerica or to third parties with whom comerica interacts or upon whom it relies although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data in addition comerica’s ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems 

comerica’s financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume andor customer activity electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics cyber attacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

 comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services and card processing services and additionally will be providing trust processing services starting in 2019 while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

 comerica’s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which comerica is highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft comerica’s business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access comerica’s network 

products and services its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks 

cyber attacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in comericas systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems as cyber threats continue to evolve comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of comerica’s systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss 

although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner 

cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at comerica or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on comerica’s systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause comerica serious negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to comerica’s operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of its confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of its customers or damage to comerica’s or comerica’s customers’ andor third parties’ computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in comerica’s security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact its results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition comerica may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event 

 in july 2016 comerica announced its efficiency and revenue program gear up the program and initial financial targets several initiatives continue to be implemented within the program there may be changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the program delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the program and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement them and some benefits may not be fully achieved as well even if the program is successful many factors can influence the amount of core noninterest expenses some of which are not wholly in our control including changing regulations benefits and health care costs technology and cybersecurity investments outside processing expenses and litigation 

furthermore the implementation of the program may have unintended impacts on comericas ability to attract and retain business customers and employees and could result in disruptions to systems processes controls and procedures any revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace accordingly comericas results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted making it less competitive and potentially causing a loss of market share additionally comericas future performance is subject to the various risks inherent to its business and operations 

 comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition as interest rates increase which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 comerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards as set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make equity repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan 

for more information regarding certain of comericas lines of business please see concentration of credit risk commercial real estate lending residential real estate lending and “energy lending” on pages f26 through f28 of the financial section of this report 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

• changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations 

comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the occ the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations and ability to make acquisitions investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations 

• cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus 

as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including comerica and its bank subsidiaries and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals 

when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica receives maintains and stores nonpublic personal information of comerica’s customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled for example in june of 2018 the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which becomes effective on january 1 2020 applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds including comerica for more information regarding data privacy regulation refer to the “supervision and regulation” section of this report 

comerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information comerica may store or maintain comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with comerica’s current practices it may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts comerica’s operating results 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions and the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f29 of the financial section of this report 

while recent interest rate rises have benefited comericas net interest income higher interest rates can also lead to fewer loan originations lower returns on investment securities and increased competition for deposits in particular comericas funding costs may continue to increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs will reduce comericas net interest margin and net interest income 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of us financial market participants selected and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight finance rate “sofr” as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight us treasury repo market at this time it is impossible to predict whether the sofr or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to libor 

comericas loan composition at december 31 2018  was 62 percent  30day libor 13 percent  other libor primarily 60day 16 percent  prime and 9 percent  fixed rate the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate including sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could 

• adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenue and expenses associate with comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s role in determining market interest rates globally 

• adversely affect the value of comerica’s floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libor’s role in determining market interest rates globally 

• prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of comerica’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate 

• result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and 

• require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition comerica’s risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr 

the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on comerica’s funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in february 2016 standard  poors downgraded comericas longterm senior credit ratings one notch to bbb and comerica banks long and shortterm credit ratings one notch to a and a2 respectively while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 reputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as well the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more 

liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer 

additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs tariffs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

recently there have been discussions regarding potential changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed also on october 1 2018 the united states canada and mexico agreed to a new trade deal the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca to replace the north american free trade agreement the usmca is subject to congressional approval and various components of the usmca are not effective until 2020 these and any other changes in tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that comerica’s customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce 

customer margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt in turn this could adversely affect comerica’s financial condition and results of operations 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

for more information regarding risk management please see risk management on pages f21 through f34 of the financial section of this report 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change these types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies comericas business and customers and have caused physical damage to comericas property in these regions in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica comerica’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 federal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified andor modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica either directly or indirectly as a result of effects on comericas customers for example the tax reform bill enacted on december 22 2017 has had and is expected to continue to have farreaching and significant effects on comerica its customers and the us economy including commercial customer borrowings due to the increase in cash flows as a result of the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense 

and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving examples include but are not limited to debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials employee fraud information theft and other malfeasance increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity comerica continues to invest in systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comerica’s financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings in particular the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has issued a new accounting standard cecl for the recognition and measurement of credit losses for loans and debt securities the new standard will be effective for comerica in the first quarter 2020 the anticipated change in loan loss reserves due to cecl is currently unknown and is dependent upon many factors that are yet to be determined such as the economic environment at adoption and any future fasb clarifications comerica anticipates that cecl will have an impact on its loan loss reserves and retained earnings as well as how it manages its capital 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f35 through f37 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f46 through f58 of the financial section of this report 

 controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports comerica files or submits under the exchange act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met due to certain inherent limitations these limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented accordingly because of the inherent limitations in control systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

 stock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive comericas stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 



 general market fluctuations including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economy industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes oil price volatility or credit loss trends among other factors could also cause comericas stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 

for the above and other reasons the market price of comericas securities may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the securities and investors should consider this before relying on the market prices of comericas securities when making an investment decision

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and money movement further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with consumers having 

the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission the department of labor dol regulates financial institutions providing services to plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” in canada comerica bank is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and in mexico by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comericas nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority inc the department of licensing and regulatory affairs of the state of michigan and the municipal securities rulemaking board msrb in the case of comerica securities inc the department of insurance and financial services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc the dol in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc and world asset management inc 

both the scope of the laws and regulations and intensity of supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place president trump has issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework and the republican majority in congress has also suggested an agenda for financial regulatory change it is too early to assess whether there will be any major changes in the regulatory environment or merely a rebalancing of the postfinancial crisis framework accordingly comerica expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

requirements for approval of activities and acquisitions 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements described below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally 

the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed the doddfrank act also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comericas ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

in addition the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica banks current rating under the “cra” is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies in many cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank further the effectiveness of comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with antimoney laundering regulations discussed below is also taken into account by the frb when considering applications for approval of acquisitions 

transactions with affiliates 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate including financial subsidiaries to no more than 10 of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include i a loan or extension of credit ii a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate iii a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate iv the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan v the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and vi securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates 

data privacy and cyber security regulation 

comerica is subject to many us federal state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures to protect the nonpublic confidential information of customers and employees the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state level limit comericas ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information 

in october 2016 the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions including comerica and their thirdparty service providers the proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2018  comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 7 million  from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 907 million  in 2017  545 million  in 2016  and 437 million  in 2015  

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a subject bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to its parent company and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends by comerica to its shareholders is subject to the nonobjection of the frb pursuant to the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar program as described below under annual capital plans and stress tests 

annual capital plans and stress tests   

comerica is subject to the frb’s annual ccar process as well as the doddfrank act stress testing dfast requirements as part of the ccar process the frb undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies including comerica that have 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets this capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating bank holding company to the frb that describes the company’s planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company tailoring hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios that capture the idiosyncratic risks and business of the company and the frb under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios including a supervisory baseline and an adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the frb 

after completing its review the frb may object or not object to the company’s proposed capital actions such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends reinstate or increase common equity repurchase programs or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments in connection with the 2017 ccar comerica submitted its 2017 capital plan to the frb on april 4 2017 on june 22 2017 comerica and the frb released the revenue loss and capital results from the annual stress testing exercises and on june 28 2017 comerica announced that the frb had completed its ccar 2017 capital plan review and did not object to the capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the fourquarter period commencing in the third quarter 2017 and ending in the second quarter 2018 comerica plans to submit its ccar 2018 capital plan to the frb consistent with supervisory guidance sr 1519 in april 2018 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the plan in june 2018 and to release its companyrun stress tests results in june or july 2018 

frb regulations also required that comerica and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate midyear stress test using financial data as of june 30th and three companyderived idiosyncratic macroeconomic scenarios base adverse and severely adverse and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario on october 19 2017 comerica released the results of its companyrun midyear stress tests stress test results are available in the investor relations section of comericas website at investorcomericacom on the “regulatory disclosures” page under financial reports 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 percent and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 percent a common equity tier 1 riskbased capital measure of at least 65 percent a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 percent a common equity tier 1 riskbased capital measure of at least 45 percent and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 percent under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2017  comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

fdic insurance assessments 

the fdic deposit insurance fund “dif” provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to 250000 per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2017  comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 51 million  including the surcharge described below 

effective july 1 2016 the fdic issued a final rule in order to implement section 334 of the doddfrank act §334 which requires the fdic to 1 raise the minimum reserve ratio for the dif to 135 percent from 115 percent 2 assess premiums on banks to reach the 135 percent goal by september 30 2020 and 3 offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion the final rule imposes a surcharge on large banks to be assessed over a period of eight quarters as a means to implement §334 comerica is subject to the surcharge assessment if this surcharge is insufficient to increase the reserve ratio to 135 percent by december 31 2018 a onetime shortfall assessment will be imposed on institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more on march 31 2019 management currently estimates that the surcharge which began july 1 2016 will continue at a rate of approximately 6 million per quarter through at least the first quarter of 2018 

capital and liquidity 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital are subject to phasein the ultimate timing for specific deductions and adjustments is yet to be determined pending the finalization of a separate proposal by banking regulators to simplify certain aspects of the capital rules more information is set forth in the capital section located on pages f17 through f19 

entities that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comericas trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica maintains additional capital for market risk as required 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain cet1 tier 1 the sum of cet1 and additional tier 1 capital and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 45 percent 6 percent and 8 percent of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively in 2017 comerica was also required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 1250 percent in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses the minimum required capital conservation buffer gradually increases to 25 percent in 2019 at december 31 2017  comerica met all requirements with cet1 tier 1 and total capital equal to 1168 percent  1168 percent  and 1384 percent  of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a capital conservation buffer of 568 percent  of its total riskweighted assets 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 4 percent comericas leverage ratio of 1089 percent  at december 31 2017  reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2017  comerica bank had cet1 tier 1 and total capital equal to 1072 percent  1072 percent  and 1261 percent  of its total riskweighted assets respectively a capital conservation buffer of 461 percent  of its total riskweighted assets and a leverage ratio of 1000 percent  

additional information on the calculation of comerica and its bank subsidiaries cet1 tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in the capital section located on pages f17 through f19   of the financial section of this report and note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f94 through f95   of the financial section of this report 

comerica must also comply with the modified liquidity coverage ratio lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario at each quarterend in 2017 comerica was in compliance with the fully phasedin lcr requirement of 100 plus a buffer 

in the second quarter 2016 us banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking the proposed rule implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the net stable funding ratio nsfr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the proposed rule comerica will be subject to a modified nsfr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longerterm stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period however a final nsfr rule has not yet been published by the us regulatory agencies so the effective date of compliance remains unknown comerica does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs 

antimoney laundering regulations 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 percent the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

incentivebased compensation 

comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation 

programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica further it is the company’s intent to continue to evolve our processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation 

in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act the rules were first proposed in 2011 section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

supervision and regulation assessment 

section 318 of the doddfrank act authorizes the federal banking agencies to assess fees against bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion equal to the expenses necessary or appropriate in order to carry out their supervision and regulation of those companies comerica expensed 21 million for 2017 which will be assessed in the first quarter 2018 

the volcker rule

title vii of the doddfrank act establishes a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements did not impact comerica directly since comerica bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or “major swap participant” comerica continues to review and evaluate whether such requirements impact the bank indirectly on october 26 2017 the cftc issued an order extending the de minimis  threshold at 8 billion through december 31 2019 with respect to the de minimis  exception to the swap dealer definition in taking this action the  de minimis  threshold will not decrease to 3 billion on december 31 2018 as proposed at this time comerica will continue to track its dealing activity and monitor any actions as it relates to the de minimis threshold 

the variation margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps were effective for comerica on march 1 2017 the variation margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity at this time comerica has met compliance with its financial counterparties with respect to the variation margin requirements 

dol fiduciary rule 

during april 2016 the dol issued a final rule related to fiduciary standards in regards to the investing of clients retirement assets the final rule expands the definition of a fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 those who provide investment advice to plans plan sponsors fiduciaries plan participants beneficiaries and iras and ira owners must either avoid payments that create conflicts of interest or comply with the protective terms of an exemption issued by the dol under new exemptions adopted with the rule financial institutions will be obligated to acknowledge their status and the status of their individual advisers as fiduciaries firms and advisers will be required to make prudent investment recommendations without regard to their own interests or the interests of those other than the customer charge only reasonable compensation and make no misrepresentations to their customers regarding recommended investments additionally the new rule requires certain disclosures to be made to investors and ongoing compliance must be monitored and documented the requirement that advisors act impartially was effective april 10 2017 other portions of the rule were scheduled to phasein by january 1 2018 but in november 2017 the dol announced an extension of that date to july 1 2019 the dol has stated that during the extension period it intends to consider whether possible changes and alternatives to exemptions would be appropriate in light of the current comment record and potential input from and action by the sec state insurance commissioners and other regulators 

consumer financial protection bureau and certain recent consumer finance regulations 

consumer financial protection bureau  comerica is subject to regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets 

home mortgage disclosure act equal credit opportunity act and uniform residential loan application  the cfpb has issued final rules changing the reporting requirements for lenders under the home mortgage disclosure act the new rules expand the range of transactions subject to these requirements to include most securitized residential mortgage loans and credit lines the rules also increase the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers comerica began collecting the expanded data on january 1 2018 

flood insurance rules 

comerica continues to monitor the development and implementation of the private flood insurance requirements to date the joint agencies have yet to issue a final rule with respect to this remaining requirement all other flood insurance requirements subject to the final rule  loans in areas having special flood hazards including the escrow of premium and fees for certain real estate loans are now effective and have been implemented by comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration   

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to support comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrowers operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below 

 for additional information specific to our energy loan portfolio please see the caption “energy lending” on pages f27 through f28 of the financial section of this report 

commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comericas cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comericas cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loans although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we generally consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for 

unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “contemplates” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” opportunity initiative “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” on track “trend” “objective” looks forward projects models and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov  or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates or changes in the frbs balance sheet will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond 

comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 in july 2016 comerica announced its efficiency and revenue initiative gear up the initiative and initial financial targets the initiative continues to be implemented there may be changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the initiative delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the initiative and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement them and some benefits may not be fully achieved as well even if the initiative is successful many factors can influence the amount of core noninterest expenses some of which are not wholly in our control including changing regulations benefits and health care costs technology and cybersecurity investments outside processing expenses and litigation 

furthermore the implementation of the initiative may have unintended impacts on comericas ability to attract and retain business customers and employees and could result in disruptions to systems processes controls and procedures any revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace accordingly comericas results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted making it less competitive and potentially causing a loss of market share additionally comericas future performance is subject to the various risks inherent to its business and operations 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including legal risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved the occurrence of such operational risks can lead to other types of risks including reputational and compliance risks that may amplify the adverse impact to comerica 

in particular cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years as reliance on information technology systems has expanded comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyber attacks spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters or acts of terrorism these incidents may occur directly or through a third party provider cyberattacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyberattacks may not be detected in a timely manner 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica although we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber losses subject to policy terms and conditions such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses 

 comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services and card processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

 comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally comerica must also comply with the modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario as well under proposed rules comerica will be subject to a modified nsfr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longerterm stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period for more information regarding the lcr and the nsfr please see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our level of regulatoryqualifying capital and ability to continue to comply with the lcr framework or the nsfr measure 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 comerica is required to satisfy stringent capital and liquidity standards including annual and midyear stress testing and quantitative standards for liquidity management as a result of capital and liquidity requirements in connection with basel iii and the doddfrank act additional information on the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements currently applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make equity repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders 

further our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the doddfrank act and the frbs rules implementing basel iii 

maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic 

conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan 

for more information regarding certain of comericas lines of business please see concentration of credit risk commercial real estate lending and “energy lending” on pages f25 through f28 of the financial section of this report 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

• changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations 

comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations although president trump has issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework and the republican majority in congress has also suggested an agenda for financial regulatory change it is too early to assess whether there will be any major changes in the regulatory environment or if changes occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities interest rates over the past several years have remained at low levels even following recent rate rises a continued low interest rate environment may continue to adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f28 of the financial section of this report 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 libor and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years as a result of this transition interest rates on our floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments may be adversely affected further any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates more than 90 percent of the comericas loans were floating at december 31 2017 of which approximately 80 percent were based on 30day libor and 20 percent were based on prime 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in february 2016 standard  poors downgraded comericas longterm senior credit ratings one notch to bbb and comerica banks long and shortterm credit ratings one notch to a and a2 respectively in march 2015 moodys investors service put global bank ratings on review following the publication of revised bank rating methodology and in may 2015 it downgraded comerica banks longterm senior credit ratings one notch to a3 while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 with consumers more and more interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust reputational risk is an increasing concern for business such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and money movement 

additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and 

services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

for more information regarding risk management please see risk management on pages f20 through f33 of the financial section of this report 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change these types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies comericas business and customers and have caused physical damage to comericas property in these regions in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica comerica’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 the tax reform bill enacted on december 22 2017 has had and is expected to continue to have farreaching and significant effects on comerica its customers and the us economy the tax reform bill lowered the corporate federal statutory tax rate and eliminated or limited certain federal corporate deductions it is too early to evaluate all of the potential consequences of the tax reform bill but such consequences could include lower commercial customer borrowings either due to the increase in cash flows as a result of the reduction in the corporate statutory tax rate or the utilization by businesses in certain sectors of alternative nondebt financing andor early retirement of existing debt further there can be no assurance that any benefits realized by comerica as a result of the reduction in the corporate federal statutory tax rate will ultimately result in increased net income whether due to decreased loan yields as a result of competition or to other factors uncertainty also exists related to state and other taxing jurisdictions response to federal tax reform which will continue to be monitored and evaluated 

federal income tax treatment of corporations may be further clarified and modified by other legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management 

controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings in particular the financial accounting standards board “fasb” has issued a new accounting standard the current expected credit loss standard “cecl” for the recognition and measurement of credit losses for loans and debt securities the new standard will be effective for comerica in the first quarter 2020 the anticipated change in loan loss reserves due to cecl is unknown and is dependent upon many factors that are yet to be determined such as the economic environment at adoption and future fasb clarifications it is anticipated that cecl will have an impact on comericas loan loss reserves and how comerica manages its capital 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting

 stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive comericas stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things 

 

general market fluctuations including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the economy industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes oil price volatility or credit loss trends among other factors could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 

for the above and other reasons the market price of comericas securities may not accurately reflect the underlying value of the securities and you should consider this before relying on the market prices of comericas securities when making an investment decision

 item 1 business 

general 

comerica incorporated “comerica” is a financial services company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and headquartered in dallas texas based on total assets as reported in the most recently filed consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies fr y9c it was among the 25 largest commercial united states “us” financial holding companies comerica was formed in 1973 to acquire the outstanding common stock of comerica bank which at such time was a michigan banking corporation and one of michigans oldest banks formerly comerica bankdetroit on october 31 2007 comerica bank a michigan banking corporation was merged with and into comerica bank a texas banking association “comerica bank” as of december 31 2016  comerica owned directly or indirectly all the outstanding common stock of 2  active banking and 33  nonbanking subsidiaries at december 31 2016  comerica had total assets of approximately 730 billion  total deposits of approximately 590 billion  total loans net of unearned income of approximately 491 billion  and shareholders’ equity of approximately 78 billion  

business segments 

comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the business bank the retail bank and wealth management in addition to the three major business segments finance is also reported as a segment we provide information about our business segments and the principal products and services provided by these segments in note 23 on pages f102 through f105 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located in the financial section of this report 

comerica operates in three primary geographic markets  texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida with select businesses operating in several other states and in canada and mexico we provide information about our market segments in note 23 on pages f102 through f105 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located in the financial section of this report 

activities with customers domiciled outside the us in total or with any individual country are not significant we provide information on risks attendant to foreign operations 1 under the caption “concentration of credit risk” on page f29 of the financial section of this report and 2 under the caption international exposure on pages f31 through f32 of the financial section of this report

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

 in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified 

competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed effective july 2011 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements including restrictions set forth in the volcker rule described under the heading the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and recent legislative and regulatory developments  below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission in canada comerica bank is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and in mexico by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comericas nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority inc in the case of comerica securities inc the department of insurance and financial services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc the department of licensing and regulatory affairs in the case of comerica securities inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc and world asset management inc 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities 

in most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb however federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica banks current rating under the “cra” is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

in addition comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comericas ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

further the effectiveness of comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with antimoney laundering regulations discussed below is also taken into account by the frb when considering applications for approval of acquisitions 

transactions with affiliates 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates the doddfrank act applied the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amended the definition of “covered transaction” to include i securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate and ii all derivatives transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

antimoney laundering regulations 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations the “host” state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases the 

doddfrank act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the interstate act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “optin” to de novo branching in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch the doddfrank act also requires that a bank holding company or bank be well capitalized and well managed rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2017  comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 142 million  from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 545 million  in 2016  437 million  in 2015  and 380 million  in 2014  

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a subject bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to its parent company and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends by comerica to its shareholders is subject to the nonobjection of the frb pursuant to the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar program for more information please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and recent legislative and regulatory developments” in this section 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a common equity tier 1 riskbased capital measure of at least 65 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a common equity tier 1 riskbased capital measure of at least 45 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2016  comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier 1 capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses certain deductions and adjustments to cet1 capital tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital are subject to phasein through december 31 2017 entities that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comericas trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica maintains additional capital for market risk as required 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain cet1 tier 1 the sum of cet1 and additional tier 1 capital and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 45 6 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively in 2016 comerica was also required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer of 0625 in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses the minimum required capital conservation buffer gradually increases to 25 in 2019 at december 31 2016  comerica met all requirements with cet1 tier 1 and total capital equal to 1109  1109  and 1327  of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a capital conservation buffer of 509  of its total riskweighted assets 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 4 comericas leverage ratio of 1018  at december 31 2016  reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2016  comerica bank had cet1 tier 1 and total capital equal to 1051    

1051  and 1240  of its total riskweighted assets respectively a capital conservation buffer of 440  of its total riskweighted assets and a leverage ratio of 965

fdic insurance assessments 

the fdic deposit insurance fund “dif” provides insurance coverage for certain deposits comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 and further amended by the doddfrank act the doddfrank act also increased the difs minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from 100000 to 250000 under the riskbased deposit premium assessment system the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2016  comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 54 million including the surcharge described below 

effective july 1 2016 the fdic issued a final rule in order to implement section 334 of the doddfrank act §334 which requires the fdic to 1 raise the minimum reserve ratio for the dif to 135 percent from 115 percent 2 assess premiums on banks to reach the 135 percent goal by september 30 2020 and 3 offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion the final rule imposes a surcharge on large banks to be assessed over a period of eight quarters as a means to implement §334 comerica is subject to the surcharge assessment if this surcharge is insufficient to increase the reserve ratio to 135 percent by december 31 2018 a onetime shortfall assessment will be imposed on institutions with total consolidated assets of 10 billion or more on march 31 2019 management currently estimates that based on the final rule fdic expense will increase by a total of approximately 20 million over the eightquarter period that began july 1 2016 

enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and recent legislative and regulatory developments 

the financial crisis led to significant changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape of the financial services industry including the overhaul of that landscape with the passage of the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 provided below is an overview of key elements of the doddfrank act relevant to comerica as well as recent legislative and regulatory developments the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on information currently available and if applicable are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

incentivebased compensation  in june 2010 the frb occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies comerica is subject to this final guidance and similar to other large banking organizations has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the 

individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica further it is the company’s intent to continue to evolve our processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation 

in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act the rules were first proposed in 2011 section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime  in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” in july 2013 us banking regulators issued a final rule for the us adoption of the basel iii regulatory capital framework basel iii includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity tier 1 cet1 capital requirement sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets rwa a standardized approach and an advanced approach introduces two new capital buffers a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer applicable to advanced approach entities establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio applicable to advanced approach entities and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards as a banking organization subject to the standardized approach the rules were effective for comerica on january 1 2015 certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital primarily related to intangible assets and surplus tier 2 capital minority interest phase in and will be fully implemented on january 1 2018 the capital conservation buffer phases in at 0625 percent beginning on january 1 2016 and ultimately increases to 25 percent on january 1 2019 comerica is not subject to the countercyclical buffer or the supplemental leverage ratio 

comericas december 31 2016  cet1 and tier 1 ratios were both 1109 percent  comericas december 31 2016  cet1 and tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule 45 percent and 6 percent respectively 

on september 3 2014 us banking regulators adopted the liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule which set for us banks the minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the final rule comerica is subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets hqla to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the rule was effective for comerica on january 1 2016 during the transition year 2016 comerica was required to maintain a minimum lcr of 90 percent beginning january 1 2017 and thereafter the minimum required lcr will be 100 percent at each quarterend in 2016 comerica was in compliance with the fully phasedin lcr requirement plus a buffer 

in the second quarter 2016 us banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking the proposed rule implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the net stable funding ratio nsfr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the proposed rule comerica will be subject to a modified nsfr standard effective january 1 2018 which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longerterm stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period comerica does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs 

interchange fees  on july 20 2011 the frb published final rules regulation ii pursuant to the doddfrank act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions comerica is subject to the final rules 

supervision and regulation assessment  section 318 of the doddfrank act authorizes the federal banking agencies to assess fees against bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion equal to the expenses necessary or appropriate in order to carry out their supervision and regulation of those companies comerica expensed 19 million for 2016 which will be assessed in the first quarter 2017 

the volcker rule  the federal banking agencies and the sec published approved joint final regulations to implement the volcker rule on december 10 2013 the volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning and sponsoring covered funds eg hedge funds and private equity funds the final regulations adopt 

a multifaceted approach to implementing the volcker rule prohibitions that relies on i detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities ii detailed compliance requirements and iii for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations in addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions eg underwriting marketmaking related activities riskmitigating hedging and trading in certain government obligations of the volcker rule the regulations also include two appendices devoted to recordkeeping and reporting requirements including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities appendix a and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities appendix b the final rule was effective april 1 2014 the volcker rule generally required full compliance with the new restrictions by july 21 2015 however the frb has extended the conformance period to july 21 2017 for covered funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 comerica is currently in compliance with the effective aspect of the volcker rule and expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within the applicable regulatory timelines additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments is set forth in note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f52 of the financial section of this report 

annual capital plans and stress tests  comerica is subject to the frb’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process as well as the doddfrank act stress testing dfast requirements as part of the ccar process the frb undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies bhcs including comerica that have 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets this capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating bhc to the frb that describes the company’s planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the frb under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios including a supervisory baseline and an adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the frb the frb reviews both quantitative factors such as projected capital ratios under a hypothetical stress scenario and qualitative factors such as the strength of the companys capital planning process on january 30 2017 the frb issued a final rule stating that going forward large and noncomplex firms such as comerica would remain subject to a quantitative assessment in ccar but would no longer be subject to the qualitative assessment as part of ccar instead the qualitative assessment would be conducted through the regular ongoing supervisory review process 

after completing its review the frb may object or not object to the company’s proposed capital actions such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends reinstate or increase common equity repurchase programs or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments in connection with the 2016 ccar comerica submitted its 2016 capital plan to the frb on april 4 2016 on june 23 2016 comerica and the frb released the revenue loss and capital results from the annual stress testing exercises and on june 29 2016 comerica announced that the frb had completed its ccar 2016 capital plan review and did not object to the capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the fourquarter period commencing in the third quarter 2016 and ending in the second quarter 2017 comerica plans to submit its ccar 2017 capital plan to the frb consistent with supervisory guidance sr 1519 in april 2017 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the plan in june 2017 and to release its companyrun stress tests results in june or july 2017 

frb regulations also required that comerica and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate midyear stress test using financial data as of june 30th and three companyderived macroeconomic scenarios base adverse and severely adverse and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario on october 20 2016 comerica released the results of its companyrun midyear stress tests stress test results are available in the investor relations section of comericas website at investorcomericacom on the “regulatory disclosures” page under financial reports 

enhanced prudential requirements  the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” to coordinate efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and to make recommendations to the frb as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the frb under the doddfrank act including capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements 

on february 18 2014 the frb issued its final regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the doddfrank act the final regulations address enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements singlecounterparty credit limits semiannual stress tests as described above under annual capital plans and stress tests and a debttoequity limit for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability they are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the us financial system and generally build on existing us and international regulatory guidance the rule also takes a multistage or phased approach to many of the requirements such as the capital and liquidity requirements most of these requirements apply to comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than 50 billion comerica has or will implement all requirements of the new rules within regulatory timelines 

resolution living will plans  section 165d of the doddfrank act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more “covered companies” to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies eg frb 

and fdic a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code covered companies such as comerica with less than 100 billion in total nonbank assets were required to submit their initial plans by december 31 2013 in addition section 165d requires fdicinsured depository institutions like comerica bank with assets of 50 billion or more to develop maintain and periodically submit plans outlining how the fdic would resolve it through the fdics resolution powers under the federal deposit insurance act the federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements in addition those rules require the filing of annual updates to the plans both comerica and comerica bank filed their respective initial and updated resolution plans by the required due dates and will submit their 2017 resolution plans prior to december 31 2017 

section 611 and title vii of the doddfrank act  section 611 of the doddfrank act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration exposure to derivatives section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives the texas finance commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of section 611 comerica banks policy is designed to comply with the texas rule accordingly comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable law 

title vii of the doddfrank act establishes a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions the structure for derivatives set forth in the doddfrank act is intended to promote among other things exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and securitybased swaps as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets in this regard the cftc and sec have issued several regulatory proposals some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2017 most of the requirements did not impact comerica since the bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer nor is it a “major swap participant” 

on october 13 2016 the cftc issued an order setting the de minimis  threshold at 8 billion through december 31 2018 with respect to the de minimis  exception to the swap dealer definition in taking this action the  de minimis  threshold will not decrease to 3 billion on december 31 2017 as initially proposed at this time comerica will continue to track its dealing activity 

the variation margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps are effective for comerica on march 31 2017 the variation margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity comerica is currently working toward meeting compliance with the variation margin requirements 

consumer finance regulations  the doddfrank act made several changes to consumer finance laws and regulations it contained provisions that have weakened the federal preemption rules applicable for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws additionally the doddfrank act created the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb“ which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets in this regard the cfpb has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the doddfrank act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the cfpb as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and nondepository nonbank entities comerica is subject to cfpb foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules in addition to certain other cfpb rules 

the foreign remittance rules fall under section 1073 of the doddfrank act the cfpb issued new regulations amending regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act effective october 28 2013 the regulations were designed to provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in countries outside the united states customer foreign remittance transfers in general the regulation requires remittance transfer providers such as comerica to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate fees and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer although comerica had implemented the model disclosures provided in appendix a to the final rule on september 18 2014 the cfpb extended the compliance exception period for the rules new disclosure requirements to july 21 2020 

on october 5 2016 effective october 1 2017 the cfpb issued final regulations establishing new consumer protections and disclosure requirements on prepaid accounts the final rule’s definition of prepaid accounts specifically includes payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts it also includes cards that are not linked to a deposit account to conduct personto person p2p transfers the regulations include i the provision of either periodic statements or free online account information access ii new account error and unauthorized transaction rights iii new “know before you choose” prepaid account disclosures iv public disclosure of account agreements for prepaid accounts and v credit protection for linked credit accounts additionally the final rule regulates overdraft credit features that may be offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts 

comerica has positioned itself to be in compliance with the new requirements 

truth in lending act “tila” and real estate settlement procedures act “respa”  in november 2013 the cfpb issued a rule implementing new tila respa integrated disclosures “trid” to replace the initial truthinlending disclosure and good faith estimate for most closedend consumer mortgage loans the effective date was october 3 2015 significant 

changes in trid include 1 expansion of the scope of loans that require respa early disclosures including bridge loans vacant land loans and construction loans 2 changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan 3 reduced tolerances for estimated fees and 4 the lender rather than the closing agent is responsible for providing final disclosures although comerica outsources most of its consumer mortgage loans consumer construction financing has been suspended this regulation has also resulted in a suspension of consumer bridge loan financing such financing has not been a significant business for comerica 

home mortgage disclosure act hmda equal credit opportunity act ecoa and uniform residential loan application urla  a revised and redesigned urla was approved by the cfpb on september 23 2016 the official approval expands the home mortgage disclosure act information about ethnicity and race that can be collected from january 1 2017 through december 31 2017 regulation c as amended by the final rule published in the federal register at 80 fr 66127 on october 28 2015 2015 hmda final rule will require financial institutions to permit applicants to selfidentify using disaggregated ethnic and racial categories beginning january 1 2018 in conformance with the 2016 urla most consumerpurpose transactions including closedend homeequity loans homeequity lines of credit and reverse mortgages are subject to the regulation most commercialpurpose transactions ie loans or lines of credit not for personal family or household purposes are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase home improvement or refinancing the final rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling ie home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral and all agriculturalpurpose loans and lines of credit comerica is monitoring and implementing changes as required 

fdic guidance on brokered deposits  on january 5 2015 the fdic issued guidance in the form of “frequently asked questions” to promote consistency by insured depository institutions in identifying accepting and reporting brokered deposits on november 13 2015 the fdic issued proposed updates to the faqs all insured depository institutions including those that are well capitalized must report brokered deposits in their consolidated reports of condition and income call reports comerica has evaluated the impact of these faqs including the proposed updates to various business units throughout the organization the faqs had only a nominal impact 

flood insurance reform   the biggertwaters flood insurance reform act of 2012 “biggertwaters act” as amended by the homeowner flood insurance affordability act of 2014 modified the national flood insurance program by i increasing the maximum civil penalty for flood disaster protection act violations to 2000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap ii requiring certain lenders including comerica to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate iii directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability iv amending the force placement requirement provisions and v permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage these requirements will impact comerica loans and extensions of credit secured with residential improved real estate the civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately the escrow provisions became effective on january 1 2016 

on october 31 2016 the federal agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the private flood insurance rules with request for additional public comments due on january 6 2017 comerica will continue to monitor the development and implementation of the private flood insurance rules 

future legislation and regulatory measures 

the environment in which financial institutions have operated since the financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot be foreseen further it is too soon for comerica to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur as a result of the recent change in the us presidential administration or if changes occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 



 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration   

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrowers operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below

commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comericas cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comericas cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loans although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we generally consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 in july 2016 comerica announced the implementation of its efficiency and revenue initiative gear up the initiative and related financial targets there may be changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the initiative delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the initiative and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement them and some benefits may not be fully achieved as well even if the initiative is successful many factors can influence the amount of core noninterest expenses some of which are not wholly in our control including changing regulations benefits and health care costs technology and cybersecurity investments outside processing expenses and litigation 

furthermore the implementation of the initiative may have unintended impacts on comericas ability to attract and retain business customers and employees and could result in disruptions to systems processes controls and procedures any revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace accordingly comericas results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted making it less competitive and potentially causing a loss of market share additionally comericas future performance is subject to the various risks inherent to its business and operations 

 comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

in september 2014 us banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the final rule comerica is subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the rule was effective for comerica on january 1 2016 during the transition year 2016 comerica was required to maintain a minimum lcr of 90 percent beginning january 1 2017 and thereafter the minimum required lcr will be 100 percent for more information regarding the lcr please see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our level of regulatoryqualifying capital and ability to continue to comply with the lcr framework 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 comerica is required to satisfy stringent capital and liquidity standards including annual and midyear stress testing and quantitative standards for liquidity management as a result of capital and liquidity requirements in connection with basel iii and the doddfrank act additional information on the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements currently applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make equity repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders 

further our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the doddfrank act and the frbs rules implementing basel iii 

maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan 

in particular oil and gas prices have remained at lower levels since mid2014 loans in the energy business line were 23 billion  or less than 5 percent  of total loans at december 31 2016  if oil and gas prices become further depressed and remain depressed for an extended period of time comericas energy portfolio could experience increased credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results additionally a prolonged period of further decreased oil prices could also have a negative impact on the texas economy which could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding comericas energy portfolio please see “energy lending” beginning on page f30 of the financial section of this report 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including legal risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved the occurrence of such operational risks can lead to other types of risks including reputational and compliance risks that may amplify the adverse impact to comerica 

in particular comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyber attacks including cyber attacks resulting in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data comerica has not experienced a cyber attack which resulted in a loss of client data however future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

• changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations 

comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec finra and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations it is too soon for comerica to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur as a result of the recent change in the us presidential administration or if changes occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations 

 comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas business infrastructure such as data processing and storage payment processing services recording and monitoring transactions internet connections and network access clearing agency and card processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current vendor regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities interest rates over the past several years have remained at low levels even following the federal open market committees 25 basis point rate rises in december 2015 and 2016 a continued low interest rate environment may continue to adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f32 of the financial section of this report 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in february 2016 standard  poors downgraded comericas longterm senior credit ratings one notch to bbb and comerica banks long and shortterm credit ratings one notch to a and a2 respectively in march 2015 moodys investors service put global bank ratings on review following the publication of revised bank rating methodology and in may 2015 it downgraded comerica banks longterm senior credit ratings one notch to a3 in february 2016 moodys revised its outlook to negative while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit 

ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 with consumers increasingly interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust reputational risk is an increasing concern for business such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes 

additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due 

to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in 2016 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least 40 percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods the nature and severity of which may be impacted by climate change these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 the present federal income tax treatment of corporations may be modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time for example the current administration has indicated it will propose reductions to the corporate statutory tax rate a decline in the federal corporate tax rate may lower comerica’s tax provision expense however it may also significantly decrease the value of comerica’s deferred tax assets “dtas” which would result in a reduction of net income in the period in which the tax change is enacted at december 31 2016 comerica’s net dtas were approximately 217 million 

as well if the president and congress approve comprehensive tax reform lowincome housing tax credits lihtcs new markets tax credits nmtcs the beneficial tax treatment of bankowned life insurance or other current tax positions taken by comerica could be at risk we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted any such changes could adversely affect comerica 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f38 through f41 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f49 through f61 of the financial section of this report

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant 

presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

 in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed effective july 2011 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements including restrictions set forth in the volcker rule described under the heading the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments  below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law certain transactions executed by comerica bank are also subject to regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission in canada comerica bank is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions and in mexico by the banco de méxico 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comericas nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority in the case of comerica securities inc the office of financial and insurance regulation of the state of michigan in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc and world asset management inc 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities 

in most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb however federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica banks current rating under the “cra” is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

in addition comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comericas ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

further the effectiveness of comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with antimoney laundering regulations discussed below is also taken into account by the frb when considering applications for approval of acquisitions 

transactions with affiliates 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates the doddfrank act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2012 the doddfrank act applies the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amends the definition of “covered transaction” to include i securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate and ii all derivatives transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

antimoney laundering regulations 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations the “host” state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases the doddfrank act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the interstate act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “optin” to de novo branching in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch effective july 21 2011 the doddfrank act also required that a bank holding company or bank be well capitalized and well managed rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas arizona california florida and michigan 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2016  comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 398 million  from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 437 million  in 2015  380 million  in 2014  and 480 million  in 2013  

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a subject bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to its parent company and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends by comerica to its shareholders is subject to the nonobjection of the frb pursuant to the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar program for more information please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” in this section 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository 

institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a common equity tier 1 riskbased capital measure of at least 65 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a common equity tier 1 riskbased capital measure of at least 45 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2015  comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to various risk categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into three tiers common equity tier 1 “cet1” additional tier 1 and tier 2 cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additionally comerica has made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital additional tier 1 capital primarily includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses certain deductions and adjustments to cet1 capital tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital are subject to phasein through december 31 2017 entities that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign 

exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comericas trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica maintains additional capital for market risk as required 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain cet1 tier 1 the sum of cet1 and additional tier 1 capital and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 45 6 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2015  comerica met all requirements with cet1 tier 1 and total capital equal to 1054  1054  and 1269  of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 4 comericas leverage ratio of 1022  at december 31 2015  reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2015  comerica bank had cet1 tier 1 and total capital equal to 1020  1020  and 1205  of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a leverage ratio of 989  

additional information on the calculation of comerica and its bank subsidiaries cet1 tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in note 20  of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f99 through f100   of the financial section of this report additional information on the timing and nature of the basel iii capital requirements is set forth below under basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime 

fdic insurance assessments 

the fdic deposit insurance fund “dif” provides insurance coverage for certain deposits comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 and further amended by the doddfrank act the doddfrank act also increased the difs minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from 100000 to 250000 the final rule implementing revisions to the assessment system became effective april 1 2011 under the riskbased deposit premium assessment system the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for 2015  comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 37 million 

in november 2015 the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on assessments in order to implement section 334 of the doddfrank act §334 which requires the fdic to 1 raise the minimum reserve ratio for the dif to 135 percent from 115 percent 2 assess premiums on banks to reach the 135 percent goal by september 30 2020 and 3 offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion the fdic proposed a surcharge on large banks to be assessed over a period of eight quarters to begin the quarter after the dif reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 115 percent as a means to implement §334 as proposed comerica would be subject to the surcharge assessment management currently estimates that based on the proposal total fdic expense would increase by approximately 10 million annually during the surcharge period which could begin in either the first or second quarter 2016 

enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments 

the recent financial crisis has led to significant changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape of the financial services industry including the overhaul of that landscape with the passage of the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 provided below is an overview of key elements of the doddfrank act relevant to comerica as well as other recent legislative and regulatory developments the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on information currently available and if applicable are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

incentivebased compensation  in june 2010 the frb occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement 

and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies comerica is subject to this final guidance and similar to other large banking organizations has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica further it is the company’s intent to continue to evolve our processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation 

on april 14 2011 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of annual incentivebased payments be deferred over a period of at least three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime  in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” in july 2013 us banking regulators issued a final rule for the us adoption of the basel iii regulatory capital framework basel iii includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity tier 1 cet1 capital requirement sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating riskweighted assets rwa a standardized approach and an advanced approach introduces two new capital buffers a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer applicable to advanced approach entities establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio applicable to advanced approach entities and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards as a banking organization subject to the standardized approach the rules were effective for comerica on january 1 2015 certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital primarily related to intangible assets and surplus tier 2 capital minority interest phase in starting january 1 2015 and will be fully implemented on january 1 2018 the capital conservation buffer phases in at 0625 percent beginning on january 1 2016 and ultimately increases to 25 percent on january 1 2019 comerica is not subject to the countercyclical buffer or the supplemental leverage ratio 

comericas december 31 2015  cet1 and tier 1 ratios were both 1054 percent  comericas december 31 2015  cet1 and tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule 45 percent and 6 percent respectively 

on september 3 2014 us banking regulators adopted the liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule which set for us banks the minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the final rule comerica is subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets hqla to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the rule is effective for comerica on january 1 2016 during the transition year 2016 comerica will be required to maintain a minimum lcr of 90 percent beginning january 1 2017 and thereafter the minimum required lcr will be 100 percent as of december 31 2015 comericas lcr ratio meets the fully phasedin 2017 requirement 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the net stable funding ratio nsfr which requires the amount of available longerterm stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period on october 31 2014 the basel committee on banking supervision issued its final nsfr rule which was originally introduced in 2010 and revised in january 2014 us banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rules to implement the nfsr in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018 while uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the us rule implementing the nsfr and whether or not comerica will be subject to the full requirements comerica is closely monitoring the development of the rule 

interchange fees  on july 20 2011 the frb published final rules regulation ii pursuant to the doddfrank act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and prohibiting network exclusivity

frb regulations also required that comerica and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate midyear stress test using financial data as of march 31st and three companyderived macroeconomic scenarios base adverse and severely adverse and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario on july 23 2015 comerica released the results of its companyrun midyear stress tests for 2016 the midyear stress test will be moved to an october submission instead of july stress test results are available in the investor relations section of comericas website at investorcomericacom on the “regulatory disclosures” page under financial reports 

enhanced prudential requirements  the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” to coordinate efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and to make recommendations to the frb as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the frb under the doddfrank act including capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements 

on february 18 2014 the frb issued its final regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the doddfrank act the final regulations address enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements singlecounterparty credit limits semiannual stress tests as described above under annual capital plans and stress tests and a debttoequity limit 

for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability they are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the us financial system and generally build on existing us and international regulatory guidance the rule also takes a multistage or phased approach to many of the requirements such as the capital and liquidity requirements most of these requirements apply to comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than 50 billion comerica has or will implement all requirements of the new rules within regulatory timelines 

resolution living will plans  section 165d of the doddfrank act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more “covered companies” to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies eg frb and fdic a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code covered companies such as comerica with less than 100 billion in total nonbank assets were required to submit their initial plans by december 31 2013 in addition section 165d requires fdicinsured depository institutions like comerica bank with assets of 50 billion or more to develop maintain and periodically submit plans outlining how the fdic would resolve it through the fdics resolution powers under the federal deposit insurance act the federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements in addition those rules require the filing of annual updates to the plans both comerica and comerica bank filed their respective initial and updated resolution plans by the required due dates the 2015 resolution plan updates are currently under review by the frb and fdic 

section 611 and title vii of the doddfrank act  section 611 of the doddfrank act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration exposure to derivatives section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives the texas finance commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of section 611 accordingly comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable law 

title vii of the doddfrank act establishes a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions the structure for derivatives set forth in the doddfrank act is intended to promote among other things exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and securitybased swaps as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets in this regard the cftc and sec have issued several regulatory proposals some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2016 

the sec and cftc have jointly adopted rules further defining the terms “swap” “securitybased swap” “securitybased swap agreement” and have also adopted final joint rules defining the terms “swap dealer” “securitybased swap dealer” “major swap participant” and “major securitybased swap participant” comerica has determined that neither it nor its subsidiaries are within the definition of “swap dealer” or “major swap participant” but some portions of the title vii regulations apply nonetheless one of these regulations centers on limiting certain otc transactions to “eligible contract participants” this regulation impacts comericas small business customers that do not qualify as eligible contract participants by making such customers ineligible for swap derivatives as hedging in their loan agreements 

consumer finance regulations  the doddfrank act made several changes to consumer finance laws and regulations it contained provisions that have weakened the federal preemption rules applicable for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws additionally the doddfrank act created the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb“ which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets in this regard the cfpb has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the doddfrank act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the cfpb as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and nondepository nonbank entities comerica is subject to cfpb foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules in addition to certain other cfpb rules 

the foreign remittance rules fall under section 1073 of the doddfrank act the cfpb issued new regulations amending regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act effective october 28 2013 the regulations were designed to provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in countries outside the united states customer foreign remittance transfers in general the regulation requires remittance transfer providers such as comerica to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate fees and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer although comerica had implemented the model disclosures provided in appendix a to the final rule on september 18 2014 the cfpb extended the compliance exception period for the rules new disclosure requirements to july 21 2020 

on november 13 2014 the cfpb issued a proposed regulation establishing new consumer protections and disclosure requirements on prepaid accounts including i the provision of either periodic statements or free online account information access ii new account error and unauthorized transaction rights iii new “know before you owe” prepaid account disclosures iv public disclosure of account agreements for prepaid accounts and v credit protection for linked credit accounts 

comerica has implemented these new rules and positioned itself to be in compliance with the new requirements 

truth in lending act “tila” and real estate settlement procedures act “respa”  in november 2013 the cfpb issued a rule implementing new tila respa integrated disclosures “trid” to replace the initial truthinlending disclosure and good faith estimate for most closedend consumer mortgage loans the effective date was october 3 2015 significant changes in trid include 1 expansion of the scope of loans that require respa early disclosures including bridge loans vacant land loans and construction loans 2 changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan 3 reduced tolerances for estimated fees and 4 the lender rather than the closing agent is responsible for providing final disclosures although comerica outsources most of its consumer mortgage loans consumer construction financing has been suspended pending further clarification from the cfpb this regulation has also resulted in a suspension of consumer bridge loan financing such financing has not been a significant business for comerica 

the truth in lending act tila requires credit card issuers to post consumer credit card agreements to their websites and submit them quarterly to the cfpb commencing february 5 2015 the cfpb implemented the rule on april 17 2015 the cfpb delayed implementation of submissions of the agreements to the cfpb until the first week of april 2016 comerica outsources its consumer credit cards and does not anticipate any negative impact 

home mortgage disclosure act hmda  in july 2015 the cfpb implemented and expanded new hmda rules the final rule adopts a dwellingsecured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal family or household purposes thus most consumerpurpose transactions including closedend homeequity loans homeequity lines of credit and reverse mortgages are subject to the regulation most commercialpurpose transactions ie loans or lines of credit not for personal family or household purposes are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase home improvement or refinancing the final rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling ie home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral and all agriculturalpurpose loans and lines of credit comerica is monitoring and implementing changes as required 

fdic guidance on brokered deposits  on january 5 2015 the fdic issued guidance in the form of “frequently asked questions” to promote consistency by insured depository institutions in identifying accepting and reporting brokered deposits on november 13 2015 the fdic issued proposed updates to the faqs all insured depository institutions including those that are well capitalized must report brokered deposits in their consolidated reports of condition and income call reports comerica is currently evaluating the impact of these faqs including the proposed updates to various business units throughout the organization and believes they will only have a nominal impact 

flood insurance reform   the biggertwaters flood insurance reform act of 2012 “biggertwaters act” as amended by the homeowner flood insurance affordability act of 2014 modified the national flood insurance program by i increasing the maximum civil penalty for flood disaster protection act violations to 2000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap ii requiring certain lenders including comerica to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate iii directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability iv amending the force placement requirement provisions and v permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage these requirements will impact comerica loans and extensions of credit secured with residential improved real estate the civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately 

on july 21 2015 certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting 1 detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and 2 helocs business purpose loans nonperforming loans loans with terms of less than one year loans for coops and condominiums and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements additionally the final rule requires comerica to escrow flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan effective january 1 2016 the federal agencies will address the private flood insurance provisions of the biggertwaters act in a separate rulemaking comerica will continue to monitor the development and implementation of the private flood insurance rules 

future legislation and regulatory measures 

the environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot be foreseen moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles 

and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration   

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrowers operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below 

 for additional information specific to our energy loan portfolio please see the caption “energy lending” on pages f31 through f33 of the financial section of this report 

commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comericas cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comericas cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loan programs although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we generally consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “contemplates” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” opportunity initiative “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” on course “trend” “objective” looks forward projects models and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov  or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as was the case with the great recession of 2008 and 2009 economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comericas earnings 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec finra and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

in particular congress and other regulators have significantly increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry their actions include but are not limited to the passage of the doddfrank act many parts of which are now in effect and the adoption of the basel iii framework in the us for additional information on these actions please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” section of the “supervisory and regulation” section of this report many provisions in the doddfrank act and the basel iii framework remain subject to regulatory rulemaking andor implementation the effects of which are not yet known 

additionally comerica may be subject to other regulatory actions that are currently under consideration or may be under consideration in the future for example should us banking regulators establish any additional capital buffers for example for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the us financial system comerica may be subject to those additional requirements further the current administration proposed in january 2010 a fee on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system calls for that fee were renewed during the 2013 federal budget discussions most recently the administrations 2015 budget proposal would impose a 7 basis point tax on us financial firms with assets over 50 billion with the goal of such proposal to penalize financial institutions for being overly leveraged if such fee or another similar fee were implemented comerica would likely be subject to its terms 

the effects of such legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be fully determined at this time we can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comericas businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

 comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

in september 2014 us banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the final rule comerica is subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets hqla to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the rule is effective for comerica on january 1 2016 during the transition year 2016 comerica will be required to maintain a minimum lcr of 90 percent beginning january 1 2017 and thereafter the minimum required lcr will be 100 percent for more information regarding the lcr please see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our level of regulatoryqualifying capital and ability to continue to comply with the lcr framework 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 while new capital and liquidity requirements in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act have been largely implemented continued compliance by comerica and its subsidiary banks with these restrictions will have an effect on comerica additional information on the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements currently applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report in light of these or other new legal and regulatory requirements comerica and our subsidiary banks are and will be in the future required to satisfy additional more stringent capital and liquidity standards including annual and midyear stress testing and quantitative standards for liquidity management these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make equity repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders 

further our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the doddfrank act and the frbs proposed and final rules implementing basel iii 

maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan 

in particular oil and gas prices have fallen sharply since mid2014 loans in the middle market  energy business line were 31 billion  or approximately 6 percent  of total loans at december 31 2015  at december 31 2015  the reserve 

allocation for energy and energyrelated loans was over 4 percent of total energy and energyrelated loans subsequent to december 31 2015  oil and gas prices dropped significantly and comerica saw additional negative migration into criticized loans if oil and gas prices continue to remain depressed for a prolonged period of time comericas energy portfolio could experience increased credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results furthermore a prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the texas economy which could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding comericas energy portfolio please see “energy lending” beginning on page f31 of the financial section of this report 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including legal risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved the occurrence of such operational risks can lead to other types of risks including reputational and compliance risks that may amplify the adverse impact to comerica 

in particular comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyber attacks including cyber attacks resulting in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica while comerica’s website wwwcomericacom  has been subject to denial of service attacks in the last few years these events did not result in a breach of comerica’s client data and account information remained secure however future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

 comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas business infrastructure such as data processing and storage payment processing services recording and monitoring transactions internet connections and network access clearing agency and card processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors it does not control their operations further while comerica has enhanced its vendor management policies and practices to facilitate comerica’s compliance with recently updated vendor regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comerica’s business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action 

 many factors can influence the amount of noninterest expenses including changing regulations pension and health care costs technology and cybersecurity investments outside processing expenses and litigation the importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow growth low net interest margin business environment comericas noninterest expenses may increase more than anticipated which could result in an adverse impact on net income 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income interest rates over the past several years have remained at low levels even following the federal open market committees 25 basis point rate rise in december a continued low interest rate environment may continue to adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f33 of the financial section of this report 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in february 2016 standard  poors downgraded comericas longterm senior credit ratings one notch to bbb and comerica banks long and shortterm credit ratings one notch to a and a2 respectively and maintained its negative outlook in march 2015 moodys investors service put global bank ratings on review following the publication of revised bank rating methodology and in may 2015 it downgraded comerica banks longterm senior credit ratings one notch to a3 in february 2016 moodys revised its outlook to negative while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring 

significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 with consumers increasingly interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust reputational risk is an increasing concern for business such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comerica’s business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comerica’s prospects 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes 

additionally the financial services industry has recently been subject to increasing regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on april 14 2011 frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 requires the regulators to issue regulations that prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred over a minimum period of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a 

result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f40 through f43 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f51 through f63 of the financial section of this report

acquisition of sterling bancshares inc 

on july 28 2011 comerica acquired all the outstanding common stock of sterling bancshares inc sterling a bank holding company headquartered in houston texas in a stockforstock transaction sterling common shareholders and holders of outstanding sterling phantom stock units received 02365 shares of comericas common stock in exchange for each share of sterling common stock or phantom stock unit as a result comerica issued approximately 24 million common shares with an acquisition date fair value of 793 million based on comericas closing stock price of 3267 on july 27 2011 based on the merger agreement outstanding and unexercised options to purchase sterling common stock were converted into fully vested options to purchase common stock of comerica in addition outstanding warrants to purchase sterling common stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock of comerica including an insignificant amount of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares the fair value of total consideration paid was 803 million the acquisition of sterling significantly expanded comericas presence in texas particularly in the houston and san antonio areas 

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant 

presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb loans in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

 in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed effective july 2011 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements including restrictions set forth in the volcker rule described under the heading the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments  below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law in canada comerica bank is supervised by the office of the superintendent of financial institutions 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comericas nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority in the case of comerica securities inc the office of financial and insurance regulation of the state of michigan in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc world asset management inc and wilson kemp  associates inc 

described below are material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities 

i n most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb however federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica banks current rating under the “cra” is “satisfactory” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

in addition comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comericas ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

further the effectiveness of comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with antimoney laundering regulations discussed below is also taken into account by the frb when considering applications for approval of acquisitions 

transactions with affiliates 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates the doddfrank act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2012 the doddfrank act applies the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amends the definition of “covered transaction” to include i securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate and ii all derivatives transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

antimoney laundering regulations 

the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations the “host” state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases the doddfrank act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the interstate act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “optin” to de novo branching in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch effective july 21 2011 the doddfrank act also required that a bank holding company or bank be well capitalized and well managed rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas arizona california florida and michigan 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2015  comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 375 million  from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 380 million  in 2014  480 million  in 2013  and 497 million  in 2012  

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association a subject bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to its parent company and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends by comerica to its shareholders is subject to the nonobjection of the frb pursuant to the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar program for more information please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” in this section 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository 

institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2014  comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions bank holding companies that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors from time to time comericas trading activities may exceed specified regulatory levels in which case comerica maintains additional capital for market risk as required 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2014  comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1050  and 1251  of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 3 to 4 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comericas leverage ratio of 1035  at december 31 2014  reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2014  comerica bank had tier 1 and total capital equal to 1036  and 1202  of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a leverage ratio of 1020  

additional information on the calculation of comerica and its bank subsidiaries tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in note 20  of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f99 through f100   of the financial section of this report additional information on the timing and nature of the basel iii capital requirements is set forth below under basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime 

fdic insurance assessments 

the fdic deposit insurance fund “dif” provides insurance coverage for certain deposits comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 and further amended by the doddfrank act the doddfrank act also increased the difs minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from 100000 to 250000 the final rule implementing revisions to the assessment system became effective april 1 2011 under the riskbased deposit premium assessment system the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly for 2014  comerica’s fdic insurance expense totaled 33 million our assessment rate could increase in the future under the current system if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases 

enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

capital purchase program 

on november 14 2008 comerica participated in the united states department of the treasury “us treasury” capital purchase program by issuing to the us treasury in exchange for aggregate consideration of 225 billion i 225 million shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series f no par value the “series f preferred stock” and ii a warrant to purchase 11479592 shares of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share that expires on november 14 2018 the “warrant” both the series f preferred stock and the warrant were accounted for as components of comericas regulatory tier 1 capital and contained terms and limitations imposed by the us treasury on march 17 2010 comerica fully redeemed the series f preferred stock previously issued to the us treasury and comerica exited the capital purchase program the warrant was separated into 11479592 warrants to purchase one share of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share and such warrants are now listed and traded on the nyse as a result of participating in the capital purchase program comerica was subject to certain executive compensation and corporate governance standards promulgated by the us treasury prior to redemption which no longer applied to comerica following the redemption 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments 

the recent financial crisis has led to significant changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape of the financial services industry including the overhaul of that landscape with the passage of the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 provided below is an overview of key elements of the doddfrank act relevant to comerica as well as other recent legislative and regulatory developments the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on information currently available and if applicable are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

incentivebased compensation  in june 2010 the frb occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to 

material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies comerica is subject to this final guidance and similar to other large banking organizations has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since 2011 as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plan’s design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica further it is the company’s intent to continue to evolve our processes going forward by monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation 

on april 14 2011 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of annual incentivebased payments be deferred over a period of at least three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime  in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” in july 2013 us banking regulators issued a final rule for the us adoption of the basel iii regulatory capital framework the regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital two new capital buffers  a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and offbalance sheet items and a supplemental leverage ratio as a banking organization subject to the standardized approach the rules are effective for comerica on january 1 2015 with certain transition provisions fully phased in on january 1 2018 

according to the rule comerica will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 25 percent when fully phased in to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses however the rules do not subject comerica to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 25 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio comerica estimates the december 31 2014  tier 1 and tier 1 common riskbased ratio would be 103  percent if calculated under the final rule as fully phased in excluding most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital comericas december 31 2014  estimated tier 1 common and tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule 7 percent and 85 percent respectively including the fully phasedin capital conservation buffer for a reconcilement of these nongaap financial measures see page f41 of the financial section of this report under the caption supplemental financial data 

on december 9 2014 us banking regulators proposed a rule that would establish an additional capital buffer for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the global financial system globally systemically important bank holding companies or “gsib” comerica would not be considered a gsib under the rule as proposed 

on september 3 2014 us banking regulators adopted the liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule which set for us banks the minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the final rule comerica is subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets hqla to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the rule is effective for comerica on january 1 2016 during the transition year 2016 comerica will be required to maintain a minimum lcr of 90 percent beginning january 1 2017 and thereafter the minimum required lcr will be 100 percent comerica continues to evaluate the impact of the rule however we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by us banking regulators within the required timetable to reach full compliance and provide a buffer for normal volatility in balance sheet dynamics comerica expects to add additional hqla which may be funded with additional debt in the future comerica does not currently expect compliance with the lcr rule will have a significant impact on net interest income 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the net stable funding ratio nsfr which requires the amount of available longerterm stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period the basel committee on banking supervision is in the process of reviewing the proposed nsfr standard and evaluating its impact on the banking system us banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rulemaking to implement the nfsr in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018 while uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the us rule implementing the nsfr and whether or not comerica will be subject to the full requirements comerica is closely monitoring the development of the rule 

interchange fees  on july 20 2011 the frb published final rules pursuant to the doddfrank act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions comerica is subject to the final rules in july 2013 a federal district court invalidated the frbs interchange fee rules the frbs appeal of the court’s ruling resulted in the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia overruling the district court reinstating the final rule as previously issued on january 20 2015 the us supreme court denied a further appeal 

supervision and regulation assessment  section 318 of the doddfrank act authorizes the federal banking agencies to assess fees against bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion equal to the expenses necessary or appropriate in order to carry out their supervision and regulation of those companies we paid 15 million in 2014 with respect to the 2013 assessment year and accrued another 15 million for the 2014 assessment year 

the volcker rule  the federal banking agencies and the sec published approved joint final regulations to implement the volcker rule on december 10 2013 the volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning and sponsoring covered funds eg hedge funds and private equity funds the final regulations adopt a multifaceted approach to implementing the volcker rule prohibitions that relies on i detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities ii detailed compliance requirements and iii for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations in addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions eg underwriting marketmaking related activities riskmitigating hedging and trading in certain government obligations of the volcker rule the regulations also include two appendices devoted to recordkeeping and reporting requirements including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities appendix a and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities appendix b the final rule was effective april 1 2014 the volcker rule generally requires full compliance with the new restrictions by july 21 2015 however the frb has recently extended the conformance period to july 21 2017 for covered funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 comerica expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within the applicable regulatory timelines additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments is set forth in note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f51 of the financial section of this report 

annual capital plans and stress tests  comerica is subject to the frb’s annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process as well as the doddfrank act stress testing dfast requirements as part of the ccar process the frb undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies bhcs including comerica that have 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets this capital adequacy assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating bhc to the frb that describes the company’s planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the frb under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios including a supervisory baseline and an adverse and a severely adverse scenario provided by the frb after completing its review the frb may object or not object to the company’s proposed capital actions such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends reinstate or increase common stock repurchase programs or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments in connection with the 2014 ccar comerica submitted its 2014 capital plan to the frb on january 3 2014 on march 26 2014 comerica announced that the frb had completed its ccar 2014 capital plan review and did not object to the capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in the plan also as required comerica submitted its ccar 2015 capital plan to the frb on january 5 2015 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the plan in march 2015 

as part of the ccar and dfast process both the frb and comerica release certain revenue loss and capital results from their stress testing exercises generally in march of each year frb regulations also require that comerica and other large bank holding companies conduct a separate midyear stress test using financial data as of march 31st and three companyderived macroeconomic scenarios base adverse and severely adverse and publish a summary of the results under the severely adverse scenario in september on march 20 2014 and september 15 2014 comerica released the results of its companyrun annual and midyear stress tests respectively which are available in the investor relations section of comericas website at investorcomericacom on the “doddfrank act stress test results” page under financial reports similar timelines will be expected for the 2015 midyear stress tests 

in october 2014 the frb modified the timing of the capital planning cycle for 2016 the annual capital plan will be moved to an april submission instead of january and the midyear stress test will be moved to an october submission instead 

of july accordingly for the 2015 capital plan submission the frb’s determination regarding capital distributions will extend over a period of five quarters 2q 2015  2q 2016 in order to accommodate the shift in the capital plan cycle in 2016 

enhanced prudential requirements  the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” to coordinate efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and to make recommendations to the frb as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the frb under the doddfrank act including capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements 

on february 18 2014 the frb issued its final regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the doddfrank act the final regulations address enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements singlecounterparty credit limits semiannual stress tests as described above under annual capital plans and stress tests and a debttoequity limit for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability they are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the us financial system and generally build on existing us and international regulatory guidance the proposal also takes a multistage or phased approach to many of the requirements such as the capital and liquidity requirements most of these requirements apply to comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than 50 billion comerica has or will implement all requirements of the new rules within regulatory timelines 

resolution living will plans  section 165d of the doddfrank act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more “covered companies” to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies eg frb and fdic a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code covered companies such as comerica with less than 100 billion in total nonbank assets were required to submit their initial plans by december 31 2013 in addition section 165d requires fdicinsured depository institutions like comerica bank with assets of 50 billion or more to develop maintain and periodically submit plans outlining how the fdic would resolve it through the fdics resolution powers under the federal deposit insurance act the federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements in addition those rules require the filing of annual updates to the plans both comerica and comerica bank filed their respective initial and updated resolution plans by the required due dates the resolution plans are currently under review by the frb and fdic 

section 611 and title vii of the doddfrank act  section 611 of the doddfrank act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered take into consideration exposure to derivatives section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives the texas finance commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of section 611 accordingly comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable law 

title vii of the doddfrank act establishes a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions the structure for derivatives set forth in the doddfrank act is intended to promote among other things exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and securitybased swaps as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets in this regard the cftc and sec have issued several regulatory proposals some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2015 

the sec and cftc have jointly adopted rules further defining the terms “swap” “securitybased swap” “securitybased swap agreement” and have also adopted final joint rules defining the terms “swap dealer” “securitybased swap dealer” “major swap participant” and “major securitybased swap participant” comerica has determined that neither it nor its subsidiaries are within the definition of “swap dealer” or “major swap participant” but some portions of the title vii regulations apply nonetheless one of these regulations centers on limiting certain otc transactions to “eligible contract participants” this regulation may have an impact on the small business customers of comericas banking subsidiaries by making such customers ineligible for swap derivatives as hedging in their loan agreements 

consumer finance regulations  the doddfrank act made several changes to consumer finance laws and regulations it contained provisions that have weakened the federal preemption rules applicable for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws additionally the doddfrank act created the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb“ which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets in this regard the cfpb has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the doddfrank act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the cfpb as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and nondepository nonbank entities comerica is subject to cfpb foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules in addition to certain other cfpb rules 

the foreign remittance rules fall under section 1073 of the doddfrank act the cfpb issued new regulations amending regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act effective october 28 2013 the regulations were designed to 

provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in countries outside the united states customer foreign remittance transfers in general the regulation requires remittance transfer providers such as comerica to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate fees and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer although comerica had implemented the model disclosures provided in appendix a to the final rule on september 18 2014 the cfpb extended the compliance exception period for the rules new disclosure requirements to july 21 2020 

on july 17 2014 the cfpb issued an interpretive rule clarifying that where a successorininterest successor who has previously acquired title to a dwelling agrees to be added as obligor or substituted for the existing obligor on a consumer credit transaction secured by that dwelling the creditors written acknowledgment of the successor as obligor is not subject to the cfpb’s abilitytorepay rule because such a transaction does not constitute an assumption as defined by regulation z in addition the cfpb issued other regulation zrelated rules that had little or no effect on comerica’s operations as it has outsourced most of its consumer loan origination and servicing 

on november 13 2014 the cfpb issued a proposed regulation establishing new consumer protections and disclosure requirements on prepaid accounts including i the provision of either periodic statements or free online account information access ii new account error and unauthorized transaction rights iii new “know before you owe” prepaid account disclosures iv public disclosure of account agreements for prepaid accounts and v credit protection for linked credit accounts 

comerica is monitoring the development of these new rules and will position itself to be in compliance with any new requirements within the established regulatory time frames 

truth in lending act  as a result of recent judicial decisions borrowers are permitted to rescind their mortgage pursuant to the truth in lending act by giving notice of their intent to rescind within three years of closing and do not need to file suit to exercise this right this decision could impact comerica’s indemnity rights with its mortgage servicing vendor as well as consumer closedend mortgage loans held in comerica’s portfolio however such impact is not anticipated to be significant 

fdic guidance on brokered deposits  on january 5 2015 the fdic issued guidance in the form of “frequently asked questions” to promote consistency by insured depository institutions in identifying accepting and reporting brokered deposits all insured depository institutions including those that are well capitalized must report brokered deposits in their consolidated reports of condition and income call reports comerica is currently evaluating the impact of these faqs to various business units throughout the organization 

flood insurance reform   the biggertwaters flood insurance reform act of 2012 “biggertwaters act” as amended by the homeowner flood insurance affordability act of 2014 modified the national flood insurance program by i increasing the maximum civil penalty for flood disaster protection act violations to 2000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap ii requiring certain lenders including comerica to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate iii directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability iv amending the force placement requirement provisions and v permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage these requirements will impact comerica loans and extensions of credit secured with residential improved real estate the civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately 

on october 21 2014 certain federal agencies issued a joint proposed rule exempting 1 detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and 2 helocs business purpose loans nonperforming loans loans with terms of less than one year loans for coops and condominiums and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements additionally the proposed rule would require comerica to offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums starting on january 1 2016 the federal agencies will address the remaining provisions of the biggertwaters act in a separate rulemaking comerica will continue to monitor the development and implementation of these rules 

future legislation and regulatory measures 

the environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot be foreseen moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 

potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration   

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrowers operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below

consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loan programs although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we generally consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” opportunity initiative “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” on course “trend” “objective” looks forward projects models and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov  or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others 

could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits the recent european debt crisis and government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with the impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comericas earnings 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec finra and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

in particular congress and other regulators have significantly increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry their actions include but are not limited to the passage of the doddfrank act many parts of which are now in effect and the adoption of the basel iii framework in the us for additional information on these actions please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” section of the “supervisory and regulation” section of this report many provisions in the doddfrank act and the basel iii framework remain subject to regulatory rulemaking andor implementation the effects of which are not yet known 

additionally comerica may be subject to other regulatory actions that are currently under consideration or may be under consideration in the future for example as discussed in the “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” section of the “supervisory and regulation” section of this report comerica is not subject to the additional capital buffer for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the global financial system however should us banking regulators establish an additional capital buffer for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the us financial system comerica may be subject to an additional buffer further the current administration proposed in january 2010 a fee on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system calls for that fee were renewed during the 2013 federal budget discussions most recently the administrations 2015 budget proposal would impose a 7 basis point tax on us financial firms with assets over 50 billion with the goal of such proposal to penalize financial institutions for being overly leveraged if such fee or another similar fee were implemented comerica would likely be subject to its terms 

the effects of such legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be fully determined at this time we can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comericas businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

 comerica’s liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms 

other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comerica’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

in september 2014 us banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us generally consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the rule comerica will be required to hold a minimum level of highquality liquid assets hqla to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the rule is effective for comerica on january 1 2016 during the transition year 2016 comerica will be required to maintain a minimum lcr of 90 percent beginning january 1 2017 and thereafter the minimum required lcr will be 100 percent to reach full compliance and provide a buffer for normal volatility in balance sheet dynamics comerica expects to add additional hqla which may be funded with additional debt in the future for more information regarding the lcr please see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our level of regulatoryqualifying capital and ability to comply with the lcr framework 

further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comerica’s liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 new capital requirements in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to comericas subsidiary banks will have an effect on comerica additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders 

the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with recent supervisory guidance basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act additional information on the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report in light of these or other new legal and regulatory requirements comerica and our subsidiary banks are and will be in the future required to satisfy additional more stringent liquidity standards including for the first time quantitative standards for liquidity management 

further our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the doddfrank act and the frbs proposed and final rules implementing basel iii or comply with the requirements of these standards earlier than might otherwise be required in connection with the annual ccar process 

the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be fully determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators however maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic 

conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan in particular oil and gas prices have fallen sharply since mid2014 loans in the middle market  energy business line were 36 billion or approximately 7 percent of total loans at december 31 2014  if oil and gas prices remain depressed for a prolonged period of time comericas energy portfolio could decrease andor experience increased credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including legal risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved the occurrence of such operational risks can lead to other types of risks including reputational and compliance risks that may amplify the adverse impact to comerica 

in particular comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyber attacks including cyber attacks resulting in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica for example along with a number of other large financial institutions websites comerica’s website wwwcomericacom  was subject to denial of service attacks in 2013 these events did not result in a breach of comerica’s client data and account information remained secure however during one attack some customers may have been prevented from accessing comerica bank’s secure websites through wwwcomericacom  in all cases the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience however future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

further comerica may be impacted by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with comerica customers that involve the theft of customer data which may include the theft of comerica debit card pin numbers and commercial cards used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties such data breaches could result in comerica incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses which could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations 

 comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas business infrastructure such as data processing and storage payment processing services recording and monitoring transactions internet connections and network access clearing agency and card processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to selecting these third party vendors it does not control their operations as such any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also expose financial institutions to risks that can result in reputational problems financial loss or regulatory actions and otherwise adversely affect comericas business and operations additionally federal banking regulators recently issued regulatory guidance on how banks select engage and manage their outside vendors these regulations may affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships 

 many factors can influence the amount of noninterest expenses including changing regulations rising pension and health care costs technology and cybersecurity investments and litigation the importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow growth low net interest margin business environment comericas noninterest expenses may increase more than anticipated which could result in an adverse impact on net income 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income interest rates over the past several years have remained at low levels a continued low interest rate environment could adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see “market and liquidity risk” beginning on page f29 of the financial section of this report 

volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in march 2012 moodys investors service downgraded comericas longterm and shortterm senior credit ratings one notch to a3 and p2 respectively from july 2012 through october 2013 fitch ratings had comericas outlook as “negative” in october 2013 fitch ratings affirmed comericas rating while revising the outlook to “stable” in january 2015 standard  poors revised its outlook on comerica to negative from stable while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb loans in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes 

additionally the financial services industry has recently been subject to increasing regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica 

will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on april 14 2011 frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 requires the regulators to issue regulations that prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred over a minimum period of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity operational compliance and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires droughts and floods these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f37 through f40 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f48 through f61 of the financial section of this report

business strategy 

comerica has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the business bank the retail bank and wealth management in addition to the three major business segments finance is also reported as a segment 

the business bank meets the needs of middle market businesses multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services including commercial loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services 

the retail bank includes small business banking and personal financial services consisting of consumer lending consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination in addition to a full range of financial services provided to small business customers this business segment offers a variety of consumer products including deposit accounts installment loans credit cards student loans home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans 

wealth management offers products and services consisting of fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking and brokerage services this business segment also offers the sale of annuity products as well as life disability and longterm care insurance products 

finance includes comericas securities portfolio and asset and liability management activities this segment is responsible for managing comericas funding liquidity and capital needs performing interest sensitivity analysis and executing various strategies to manage comericas exposure to liquidity interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk 

comerica operates in three primary geographic markets  texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida with select businesses operating in several other states and in canada and mexico comerica produces market segment results for its three primary geographic markets as well as other markets other markets includes florida arizona the international finance division and businesses with a national perspective 

we provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services 1 under the caption “analysis of net interest incomefully taxable equivalent fte” on page f6 of the financial section of this report 2 under the caption “net interest income” on pages f7 through f8 of the financial section of this report and 3 under the caption “noninterest income” on pages f8 through f9 of the financial section of this report 

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb loans in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future 

 in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures 

in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed effective july 2011 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to regulatory requirements including restrictions set forth in the volcker rule described under the heading the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments  below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the federal reserve system the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comericas nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority in the case of comerica securities inc the 

office of financial and insurance regulation of the state of michigan in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc world asset management inc and wilson kemp  associates inc 

described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities 

i n most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb however federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica banks rating under the “cra” as of december 31 2013 was “outstanding” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities 

in addition comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comericas ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

further the effectiveness of comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with antimoney laundering regulations discussed below is also taken into account by the frb when considering applications for approval of acquisitions 

transactions with affiliates 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates the doddfrank act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2012 the doddfrank act applies the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amends the definition of “covered transaction” to include i securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate and ii all derivatives transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

antimoney laundering regulations 

t he uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations the “host” state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases the doddfrank act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the interstate act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “optin” to de novo branching in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch effective july 21 2011 the doddfrank act also required that a bank holding company or bank be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas arizona california florida and michigan 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2014 comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 204 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 480 million in 2013 497 million in 2012 and 292 million in 2011 

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are specifically prohibited from paying dividends if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends is subject to the nonobjection of the frb pursuant to the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar program for more information please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” in this section 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2013  comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to 

such assets or commitments a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions bank holding companies that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2013  comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1064  and 1310  of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 3 to 4 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comericas leverage ratio of 1077  at december 31 2013  reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2013  comerica bank had tier 1 and total capital equal to 1053  and 1290  of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a leverage ratio of 1066  additional information on the calculation of comerica and its bank subsidiaries tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f105 through f106 of the financial section of this report 

fdic insurance assessments 

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 and further amended by the doddfrank act due to the passage of the doddfrank act the fdic was required to redefine the deposit insurance assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and make changes to assessment rate methodology the fdic adopted a final rule on february 7 2011 that revised the riskbased assessment system for all large insured depository institutions the first assessment under the new rule was paid in the third quarter of 2011 the doddfrank act also increased the difs minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from 100000 to 250000 

in november 2009 the fdic required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 through 2012 the prepaid assessments were to be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment was exhausted or the balance of the prepayment was returned whichever occurred first comerica paid such prepaid assessment of 200 million on december 30 2009 the remaining prepayment balance of 73 million was refunded to comerica in june 2013 for 2013 fdic insurance assessments totaled 33 million 

enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies 

the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

capital purchase program 

on november 14 2008 comerica participated in the united states department of the treasury “us treasury” capital purchase program by issuing to the us treasury in exchange for aggregate consideration of 225 billion i 225 million shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series f no par value the “series f preferred stock” and ii a warrant to purchase 11479592 shares of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share that expires on november 14 2018 the “warrant” both the series f preferred stock and the warrant were accounted for as components of comericas regulatory tier 1 capital and contained terms and limitations imposed by the us treasury on march 17 2010 comerica fully redeemed the series f preferred stock previously issued to the us treasury and comerica exited the capital purchase program the warrant was separated into 11479592 warrants to purchase one share of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share and such warrants are now listed and traded on the nyse as a result of participating in the capital purchase program comerica was subject to certain executive compensation and corporate governance standards promulgated by the us treasury prior to redemption which no longer applied to comerica following the redemption 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments 

the recent financial crisis has led to significant changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape of the financial services industry including the overhaul of that landscape with the passage of the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 provided below is an overview of key elements of the doddfrank act relevant to comerica as well as other recent legislative and regulatory developments the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on information currently available and if applicable are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

financial crisis responsibility fee  on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee the “financial crisis responsibility fee” on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system calls for that fee were renewed during the 2013 federal budget discussions as the proposal is understood the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica the financial crisis responsibility fee was not included in the doddfrank act 

incentivebased compensation  in june 2010 the frb occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies comerica is subject to this final guidance 

on april 14 2011 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of annual incentivebased payments be deferred over a period of at least three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime  in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” in july 2013 us banking regulators issued a final rule for the us adoption of the basel iii regulatory capital framework the regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital two new capital buffers  a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and offbalance sheet items and a supplemental leverage ratio as a banking organization subject to the standardized approach the rules will be effective for comerica on january 1 2015 with certain transition provisions fully phased in on january 1 2018 

according to the rule comerica will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 25 percent when fully phased in to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses however the rules do not subject comerica to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 25 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio comerica estimates the december 31 2013  tier 1 and tier 1 common riskbased ratio would be 103 percent if calculated under the final rule as fully phased in excluding most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital comericas december 31 2013  estimated tier 1 common and tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule 7 percent and 85 percent respectively including the fully phasedin capital conservation buffer for a reconcilement of these nongaap financial measures see page f47 of the financial section of this report under the caption supplemental financial data 

comerica expects that us banking regulators will establish an additional capital buffer for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the us financial system domestic systemically important banks or dsib as a dsib comerica 

would be subject to the additional buffer while the level and timing of a dsib buffer is not currently known comerica expects to exceed all required capital levels within regulatory timelines 

on october 24 2013 us banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement in the us the proposed rule generally consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio lcr minimum liquidity measure established under the basel iii liquidity framework under the proposed rule comerica would be subject to a modified lcr standard which requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of highquality liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 21day systematic liquidity stress scenario under the proposal the lcr rules would be fully phased in on january 1 2017 with a transition period beginning january 1 2015 comerica is currently evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule however we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by us banking regulators within the required timetable uncertainty exists as to the final form and timing of the proposed rule and balance sheet dynamics may vary in the future as a result the corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives the basel iii liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure the net stable funding ratio nsfr which requires the amount of available longerterm stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period the basel committee on banking supervision is in the process of reviewing the proposed nsfr standard and evaluating its impact on the banking system us banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rulemaking to implement the nfsr in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018 while uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the us rule implementing the nsfr and whether or not comerica will be subject to the full requirements comerica is closely monitoring the development of the rule 

interchange fees  on july 20 2011 the frb published final rules pursuant to the doddfrank act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions comerica is subject to the final rules in july 2013 a federal district court invalidated the interchange fee rules the frb has appealed the court’s ruling and requested that the interchange fee remain in place pending appeal which was granted the appeal is currently pending in the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia comerica is closely monitoring the development of this case 

supervision and regulation assessment  section 318 of the doddfrank act authorizes the federal banking agencies to assess fees against bank holding companies with total consolidated assets in excess of 50 billion equal to the expenses necessary or appropriate in order to carry out their supervision and regulation of those companies we paid 15 million in 2013 with respect to the 2012 assessment year and accrued another 15 million for the 2013 assessment year 

the volcker rule  the federal banking agencies and the sec published approved joint final regulations to implement the volcker rule on december 10 2013 the volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from owning and sponsoring covered funds eg hedge funds and private equity funds the final regulations adopt a multifaceted approach to implementing the volcker rule prohibitions that relies on i detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities ii detailed compliance requirements and iii for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations in addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions eg underwriting marketmaking related activities riskmitigating hedging and trading in certain government obligations of the volcker rule the regulations also include two appendices devoted to recordkeeping and reporting requirements including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities appendix a and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities appendix b the final rule becomes effective april 1 2014 the volcker rule generally requires full compliance with the new restrictions by july 21 2015 comerica is closely monitoring the development of the volcker rule and expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within the applicable regulatory timelines additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments is set forth in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f66 through f67 of the financial section of this report 

annual capital plans  on november 22 2011 the frb issued a final rule requiring toptier us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review and issued instructions regarding stress testing as part of the 2012 capital plan review program under the rule the frb will annually evaluate institutions capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases as required comerica submitted its 2013 capital plan to the frb on january 7 2013 on march 14 2013 comerica announced that the frb had completed its 2013 capital plan review and did not object to the 2013 capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in such plan also as required comerica submitted its 2014 capital plan to the frb on january 3 2014 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the 2014 plan in march 2014 prior to october 12 2013 comerica was subject to the capital plan review cappr program and is currently subject to the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar program which includes additional stress testing using the frbs models disclosure requirements beyond what was necessitated pursuant to the cappr program and a higher level of scrutiny by the frb 

enhanced prudential requirements  the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” to coordinate efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and will make recommendations to the frb as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the frb under the doddfrank act including capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements 

on december 20 2011 the frb issued its proposed regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the doddfrank act the proposed regulations address enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements singlecounterparty credit limits semiannual stress tests and a debttoequity limit for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability they are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the us financial system and generally build on existing us and international regulatory guidance the proposal also takes a multistage or phased approach to many of the requirements such as the capital and liquidity requirements most of these requirements will apply to comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than 50 billion however the proposal defers several key aspects of the new enhanced requirements to future proposals as a result the full impact of these enhanced standards on comerica and its competitors cannot yet be fully assessed it is anticipated that these requirements will be issued in 2014 

office of financial research assessments  the doddfrank act established the office of financial research “ofr” to serve the fsoc and the public by improving the quality transparency and accessibility of financial data and information by conducting and sponsoring research related to financial stability and by promoting best practices in risk management on may 21 2012 the department of the treasury published final regulations to implement beginning july 20 2012 a semiannual assessment scheme for covering expenses of the ofr based on the asset size of each assessed company as of the end of the preceding year 

resolution living will plans  section 165d of the doddfrank act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more “covered companies” to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies eg frb and fdic a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code covered companies such as comerica with less than 100 billion in total nonbank assets were required to submit their initial plans by december 31 2013 in addition section 165d requires fdicinsured depository institutions like comerica bank with assets of 50 billion or more to develop maintain and periodically submit plans outlining how the fdic would resolve it through the fdics resolution powers under the federal deposit insurance act the federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements both comerica and comerica bank filed their respective resolution plans in advance of the above due date the resolution plans are currently under review by the frb and fdic 

section 611 and title vii of the doddfrank act  section 611 of the doddfrank act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered takes into consideration exposure to derivatives section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives the texas finance commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of section 611 accordingly comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable law 

title vii of the doddfrank act establishes a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions the structure for derivatives set forth in the doddfrank act is intended to promote among other things exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and securitybased swaps as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets in this regard the cftc and sec have issued several regulatory proposals some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2014 

the sec and cftc have jointly adopted rules further defining the terms “swap” “securitybased swap” “securitybased swap agreement” and have also adopted final joint rules defining the terms “swap dealer” “securitybased swap dealer” “major swap participant” and “major securitybased swap participant” comerica has determined that neither it nor its subsidiaries are within the definition of “swap dealer” or “major swap participant” but some portions of the title vii regulations apply nonetheless one of these regulations centers on limiting certain otc transactions to “eligible contract participants” this regulation may have an impact on the small business customers of comericas banking subsidiaries by making such customers ineligible for swap derivatives as hedging in their loan agreements 

consumer finance regulations  the doddfrank act made several changes to consumer finance laws and regulations it contained provisions that have weakened the federal preemption rules applicable for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws additionally the doddfrank act created the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb“ which has a broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices and possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets in this regard the cfpb has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the doddfrank act that were 

specifically identified as being enforced by the cfpb as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and nondepository nonbank entities comerica is subject to cfpb foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules in addition to certain other cfpb rules 

the foreign remittance rules fall under section 1073 of the doddfrank act the cfpb issued new regulations amending regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act effective october 28 2013 the regulations are designed to provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in countries outside the united states customer foreign remittance transfers in general the regulation requires remittance transfer providers such as comerica to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate fees and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer comerica has implemented the model disclosures provided in appendix a to the final rule 

on january 10 2013 the cfpb issued three major rules relating to home mortgage loans the first rule amends regulation z to implement amendments made by sections 1461 and 1462 of the doddfrank act regulation z currently requires creditors to establish escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling higher priced mortgage loans as noted in the paragraph below occur in a transaction where the annual percentage rate is higher than the average prime offer rate by certain amounts points and fees exceed certain ceiling amounts or the credit transaction documents permit the creditor to charge or collect a prepayment penalty more than 36 months after transaction closing or permit such fees or penalties to exceed in the aggregate more than 2 percent of the amount prepaid the rule implements statutory changes that lengthen the period of time for which the mandatory escrow must be maintained and exempts certain transactions from the requirement comerica’s current policy does not permit business units to make first lien higher priced mortgage loans therefore this rule should not impact comerica’s loan servicing system the effective date of the rule was june 1 2013 

the second rule expands the universe of loans subject to the home ownership and equity protection act “hoepa” hoepa establishes rules related to higher priced mortgage loans hoepa applies mainly to higher priced mortgage loans securing a consumers principal dwelling including purchase money loans and home equity lines of credit “helocs”    the existing tests for coverage were revised and a new prepayment penalty test   for hoepa coverage was added the new rule implements new restrictions and requirements concerning loan terms and origination practices for mortgage loans that are within hoepas coverage comerica’s mortgage servicing vendor phh mortgage corporation “phh” has updated its system to comply with hoepa requirements for purchase money loans and helocs for hoepa’s prepayment penalty limitation additionally comerica’s applicable policies and procedures for personal purpose loans secured by a principal dwelling have been updated to meet compliance the new rule was effective january 10 2014 

the third rule issued on january 10 2013 is another amendment to regulation z this rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the doddfrank act which generally require creditors to make a reasonable good faith determination of a consumers ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling excluding an openend credit plan timeshare plan reverse mortgage or temporary loan and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages” a “covered” residential mortgage includes any consumer credit personal purpose closedend transaction secured by a 14 family dwelling regardless of lien position primary and secondary homes and excludes home equity lines of credit bridge and construction loans that are 12 months or less and business purpose loans that are placed in comerica bank’s portfolio the rule also implements section 1414 of the doddfrank act which limits prepayment penalties finally the rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated comerica has modified its policies and procedures to meet these requirements the effective date was january 10 2014 

biggertwaters flood insurance reform act of 2012   in 2012 congress passed the biggertwaters flood insurance reform act “act” the act modified the national flood insurance program as follows i increasing the maximum civil penalty for flood disaster protection act violations to 2000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap ii requiring lenders to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate including mobile homes unless the lending institution has assets of less than 1 billion as of july 6 2012 the date of enactment iii directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of the availability of such flood insurance iv amending the force placement requirement provisions and v permitting a lender to charge a borrower for the cost of premiums and fees incurred for coverage when the policy has lapsed or has insufficient coverage the amendments to the force placement provisions and the civil penalty provisions were effective immediately in october 2013 the federal agencies eg occ frb fdic farm credit administration and national credit union association issued a proposed rule establishing requirements with respect to the escrow of flood insurance payments the acceptance of private flood insurance and force placed insurance these requirements will impact comerica loans and extensions of credit secured with residential improved real estate comerica is currently reviewing the impact of these proposed requirements it is anticipated that the federal agencies will issue a final rule in 2014 

future legislation and regulatory measures 

the environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot 

be foreseen moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration   

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrowers operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below 

 

 commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comericas cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comericas cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loan programs although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we generally consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” opportunity initiative “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” on course “trend” “objective” looks forward and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov  or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others 

could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy costs fuel prices state and local municipal budget deficits the recent european debt crisis and government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with the impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comericas earnings 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 global capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility and disruption disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit comericas ability to access capital and manage liquidity which may adversely affect comericas business financial condition and results of operations further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in march 2012 moodys investors service downgraded comericas longterm and shortterm senior credit ratings one notch to a3 and p2 respectively from july 2012 through october 2013 fitch ratings had comericas outlook as “negative” in october 2013 fitch ratings affirmed comericas rating while revising the outlook to “stable” while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated 

at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

in particular congress and other regulators have recently increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry their actions include but are not limited to the passage of the doddfrank act many parts of which are now in effect and the adoption of the basel iii framework in the us for additional information on these actions please see “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other recent legislative and regulatory developments” section of the “supervisory and regulation” section of this report many provisions in the doddfrank act and the basel iii framework remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and implementation the effects of which are not yet known 

the effects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be fully determined at this time moreover as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown any delay in the economic recovery or a worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect comerica we can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comericas businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 new capital requirements in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to comericas subsidiary banks will have a significant effect on comerica additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders 

the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with recently proposed supervisory guidance basel iii and the requirements of the doddfrank act additional information on the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section of this report in light of these or other new legal and regulatory requirements comerica and our subsidiary banks may be required to satisfy additional more stringent liquidity standards including for the first time quantitative standards for liquidity management we cannot fully predict at this time the final form of or the effects of these regulations 

further our regulators may also require us to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the doddfrank act and the frbs proposed and final rules implementing basel iii or comply with the requirements of these standards earlier than might otherwise be required in connection with the annual capital plan review process 

the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be fully determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators however maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions and supply chain factors any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved 

in particular comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica also faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure while comerica has selected these third party vendors carefully it does not control their operations as such any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect comericas business and operations 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyber attacks spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica for example along with a number of other large financial institutions websites comerica’s website wwwcomericacom was subject to denial of service attacks in 2013 these events did not result in a breach of comerica’s client data and account information remained secure however during one attack some customers may have been prevented from accessing comerica bank’s secure websites through wwwcomericacom in all cases the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience however future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

further comerica may be impacted by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with comerica customers that involve the theft of customer data which may include the theft of comerica debit card pin numbers and commercial cards used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties such data breaches could result in comerica incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses which could result in a material adverse effect on its results of operations 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet 

regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb loans in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes 

additionally the financial services industry has recently been subject to increasing regulation for more information see the “supervision and regulation” section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure 

if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on april 14 2011 frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the doddfrank act section 956 requires the regulators to issue regulations that prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred over a minimum period of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation as other financial institutions as referenced above may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market and liquidity operational compliance business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f41 through f46 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f54 through f63 of the financial section of this report

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products 

comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed effective july 2011 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “financial reform act” also requires the well capitalized and well managed standards to be met at the financial holding company level comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies subject to the prohibitions of the volcker rule once implemented through regulation described below insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking travel agent services and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking under the texas finance code comerica bank has elected to be a member of the federal reserve system “frs” under the federal reserve act and consequently is supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” under the national bank act comerica bank  trust national association by virtue of being a national bank is also a member of the frs the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund “dif” of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comericas nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory 

agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority in the case of comerica securities inc the office of financial and insurance regulation of the state of michigan in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the case of comerica securities inc world asset management inc and wilson kemp  associates inc 

described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its subsidiaries the descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described changes in applicable law or regulation and in their application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted but they may have a material effect on the business of comerica and its subsidiaries 

requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities 

i n most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb however federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bank holding companies prior approval is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company including a financial holding company or a bank 

community reinvestment act 

the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” requires us banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities comerica banks current rating under the “cra” is “outstanding” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities in addition comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are each “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comericas ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company finally the effectiveness of comerica and its subsidiaries in complying with antimoney laundering regulations discussed below is also taken into account by the frb when considering applications for approval of acquisitions 

transactions with affiliates 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates the financial reform act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2012 the financial reform act applies the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amends the definition of “covered transaction” to include i securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate and ii all derivatives transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty 

privacy 

the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the disclosure the fair credit reporting act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes 

antimoney laundering regulations 

t he uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act “usa patriot act” of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of us antimoney laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act and its regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the financial reform act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations the “host” state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases the financial reform act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the interstate act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “optin” to de novo branching in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch effective july 21 2011 the financial reform act also required that a bank holding company or bank be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas arizona california florida and michigan 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2013 comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 277 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 497 million in 2012 292 million in 2011 and 28 million in 2010 

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are specifically prohibited from paying dividends if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends is subject to approval by the frb pursuant to the capital plan review program for more information please see “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” in this section 

source of strength and crossguarantee requirements

may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 

fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2012 comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated 

subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions bank holding companies that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2012 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1013  and 1314  of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 3 to 4 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comericas leverage ratio of 1052  at december 31 2012 reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2012 comerica bank had tier 1 and total capital equal to 1015  and 1299  of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a leverage ratio of 1055  additional information on the calculation of comerica and its bank subsidiaries tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f107 of the financial section of this report 

fdic insurance assessments 

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 and further amended by the financial reform act due to the passage of the financial reform act the fdic was required to redefine the deposit insurance assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and make changes to assessment rate methodology the fdic adopted a final rule on february 7 2011 that revised the riskbased assessment system for all large insured depository institutions the first assessment under the new rule was paid in the third quarter of 2011 

in november 2009 the fdic required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 through 2012 the prepaid assessments are applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first comerica paid such prepaid assessment of 200 million on december 30 2009 for 2012 fdic insurance assessments totaled 38 million the remaining prepayment at december 31 2012 was 81 million against which 2013 dif assessments will be applied 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

capital purchase program 

on november 14 2008 comerica entered the capital purchase program by issuing to the united states department of the treasury “us treasury” in exchange for aggregate consideration of 225 billion 1 225 million shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series f no par value the “series f preferred stock” and 2 a warrant to purchase 11479592 shares of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share the “warrant” both the series f preferred stock and the warrant were accounted for as components of comericas regulatory tier 1 capital and contained terms and limitations imposed by the us treasury on march 17 2010 comerica fully redeemed the series f preferred stock previously issued to the us treasury and comerica exited the capital purchase program the warrant was separated into 11479592 warrants to purchase one share of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share and such warrants are now listed and traded on the nyse as a result of participating in the capital purchase program comerica was subject to certain executive compensation and corporate governance standards promulgated by the us treasury prior to redemption which no longer applied to comerica following the redemption

temporary liquidity guarantee program 

among other programs and actions taken by the us regulatory agencies during the financial crisis the fdic implemented in 2008 the temporary liquidity guarantee program “tlgp” to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system the tlgp was comprised of the debt guarantee program “dgp” and the transaction account guarantee program “tagp” the dgp temporarily guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt eg promissory notes unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on october 14 2008 and continuing through october 31 2009 for eligible debt issued by that date the fdic provided the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or december 31 2012 or june 30 2012 for debt issued prior to april 1 2009 the tagp offered a temporary full guarantee for noninterestbearing transaction accounts held at participating fdicinsured depository institutions the unlimited deposit coverage was available beginning october 14 2008 and was in addition to the 250000 fdic deposit insurance coverage per account that was included as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 participation in both the dgp and the tagp was voluntary 

comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association participated in the tlgp as of december 31 2012 comerica had no senior unsecured debt outstanding under the dgp comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association voluntarily participated in the tagp from october 2008 until they opted out effective july 1 2010 the tagp expired as of december 31 2010 for further discussion of the financial reform act refer to “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” section below in this “supervisory and regulation” section 

for additional details about the tglp see pages f20 and f21 of the financial section of this report under the caption “deposits and borrowed funds” 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the recent financial crisis has led to significant changes in the competitive landscape of the financial services industry and an overhaul of the legislative and regulatory landscape with the passage of the financial reform act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 the financial reform act provides for among other matters increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions provided below is an overview of key elements of the financial reform act relevant to comerica most of the provisions contained in the financial reform act became effective immediately upon enactment however many have delayed effective dates implementation of the financial reform act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

• the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” will coordinate efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and will make recommendations to the frb as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the frb under the financial reform act including capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements as a bank holding company with total consolidated assets exceeding 50 billion comerica will be subject to these enhanced prudential requirements 

• the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb“ granted broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets 

• interest on commercial demand deposits allows interest on commercial demand deposits which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits depending on the interplay of interest deposit credits and service charges 

• unlimited deposit insurance extension provided unlimited deposit insurance on noninterestbearing accounts from december 31 2010 to december 31 2012 

• deposit insurance changed the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity increased the deposit insurance funds minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from 100000 to 250000 

• derivatives created a new framework for the regulation of otc derivatives activities allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives but requires banks to shift energy uncleared commodities and agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company 

• interchange fee limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants to an amount reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer 

• trust preferred securities prohibits bank holding companies with more than 15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as tier 1 capital and allows for a phasein period of three years beginning january 1 2013 as of december 31 2012 comerica had no remaining trust preferred securities outstanding 

• the volcker rule broadly restricts banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and private equity fund sponsorship and investment activities and generally requires full compliance with the new restrictions by july 2014 

the financial reform act also 

• requires that publicly traded companies give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and “golden parachute” payments 

• weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws 

• requires creation of “living wills” describing the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy during times of financial distress comericas initial resolution plan living will must be submitted no later than december 31 2013 and 

• establishes the office of financial research “ofr” to serve the fsoc and the public by improving the quality transparency and accessibility of financial data and information by conducting and sponsoring research related to financial stability and by promoting best practices in risk management 

the environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot now be foreseen the financial reform act will have important implications for comerica and the entire financial services industry as the financial reform act requires that many studies be conducted and that hundreds of regulations be written in order to fully implement it the full impact of this legislation on comerica its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years 

other recent legislative and regulatory developments 

overdraft fees  on november 12 2009 the frb adopted amendments to its regulation e effective july 1 2010 that prohibit financial institutions from charging clients overdraft fees on automated teller machine “atm” and onetime debit card transactions unless a consumer consents or opts in to the overdraft service for those types of transactions if a consumer does not opt in overdraft fees on any atm transaction or onetime debit transaction are prohibited overdrafts on the payment of checks and recurring electronic bill payments are not covered by this rule before opting in the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institutions overdraft services including the fees associated with the service and the consumers choices financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms conditions and features including pricing that they provide to consumers who do opt in 

financial crisis responsibility fee  on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee the “financial crisis responsibility fee” on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system calls for that fee have been renewed during the 2013 federal budget discussions as the proposal is understood the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica the financial crisis responsibility fee was not included in the financial reform act 

incentivebased compensation  in june 2010 the frb occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements 1 should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk 2 should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and 3 should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies comerica is subject to this final guidance 

on april 14 2011 the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the financial reform act section 956 directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines 

prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the financial reform act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of annual incentivebased payments be deferred over a period of at least three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards comerica is monitoring the development of this rule 

basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime  in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation “basel iii” in june 2012 us banking regulators issued proposed rules for the us adoption of the basel iii regulatory capital framework the proposed regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital two new capital buffers a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and offbalance sheet items and a supplemental leverage ratio under the proposal rules were expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019 

according to the proposed rules comerica would be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 25 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses however the rules as proposed would not subject comerica to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 25 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio 

the basel iii liquidity framework which was revised by the basel committee in january 2013 includes two minimum liquidity measures the liquidity coverage ratio the “lcr” requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of highquality liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the revisions announced by the basel committee eased several requirements related to the lcr including certain outflow assumptions the net stable funding ratio requires the amount of available longerterm stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period comericas liquidity position is strong but if subject to the basel iii liquidity framework as currently proposed comerica may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives while uncertainty exists in both the final form of the us rules implementing the basel iii liquidity framework and whether or not comerica will be subject to the full requirements comerica is closely monitoring the development of the rules we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by us banking regulators within regulatory timelines 

interchange fees  on july 20 2011 the frb published final rules pursuant to the financial reform act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction the restrictions on interchange transaction fees do not apply to issuers with assets of less than 10 billion comerica is subject to the final rules 

the volcker rule  the federal banking agencies and the sec published proposed regulations to implement the volcker rule on november 7 2011 the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” requested comments on a very similar rule on january 11 2012 the proposal adopts a multifaceted approach to implementing the volcker rule prohibitions that relies on i detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities ii detailed compliance requirements and iii for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations in addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions of the volcker rule the proposal also includes three appendices devoted to recordkeeping and reporting requirements including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities appendix a detailed guidance regarding trading undertaken in connection with market making activities appendix b and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities appendix c pending issuance of the final rules the frb issued a policy statement on april 19 2012 indicating that entities subject to the new rules would be afforded a full two years to implement them comerica is closely monitoring the development of the volcker rule and expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within regulatory timelines 

annual capital plans  on november 22 2011 the frb issued a final rule requiring toptier us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review and issued instructions regarding stress testing as part of the 2012 capital plan review program under the rule the frb will annually evaluate institutions capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases as required comerica submitted its 2012 capital plan to the frb on january 9 2012 on march 14 2012 comerica announced that the frb had completed its 2012 capital plan review and did not object to the 2012 capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in such plan also as required comerica submitted its 2013 capital plan to the frb on january 7 2013 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the 2013 plan by midmarch 2013 comerica is currently subject to the capital plan review cappr program but will be subject to the comprehensive capital assessment and review ccar program after october 12 2013 

enhanced prudential requirements  on december 20 2011 the frb issued its proposed regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the financial reform act the proposed regulations address enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements singlecounterparty credit limits semiannual stress tests and a debttoequity limit for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability they are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the us financial system and generally build on existing us and international regulatory guidance the proposal also takes a multistage or phased approach to many of the requirements such as the capital and liquidity requirements most of these requirements will apply to comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than 50 billion however the proposal defers several key aspects of the new enhanced requirements to future proposals as a result the full impact of these enhanced standards on comerica and its competitors cannot yet be fully assessed 

ofr assessments  on may 21 2012 the department of the treasury published final regulations to implement beginning july 20 2012 a semiannual assessment scheme for covering expenses of the ofr based on the asset size of each assessed company as of the end of the preceding year 

resolution living will plans  section 165d of the financial reform act requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more “covered companies” to prepare and submit to the federal banking agencies eg frb and fdic a plan for their rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code covered companies such as comerica with less than 100 billion in total nonbank assets must submit their initial plans by december 31 2013 in addition section 165d requires fdicinsured depository institutions with assets of 50 billion or more to develop maintain and periodically submit plans outlining how the fdic would resolve it through the fdics resolution powers under the federal deposit insurance act the federal banking agencies have issued rules to implement these requirements 

section 611 and title vii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act  section 611 of the financial reform act prohibits a state bank from engaging in derivative transactions unless the lending limit laws of the state in which the bank is chartered takes into consideration exposure to derivatives section 611 does not provide how state lending limit laws must factor in derivatives the texas finance commission has adopted an administrative rule meeting the requirements of section 611 accordingly comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable law 

title vii of the financial reform act establishes a comprehensive framework for overthecounter “otc” derivatives transactions the structure for derivatives set forth in the financial reform act is intended to promote among other things exchange trading and centralized clearing of swaps and securitybased swaps as well as greater transparency in the derivatives markets and enhanced monitoring of the entities that use these markets in this regard the cftc and sec have issued several regulatory proposals some of which are now effective or will become effective in 2013 

the sec and cftc have jointly adopted rules further defining the terms “swap” “securitybased swap” “securitybased swap agreement” and have also adopted final joint rules defining the terms “swap dealer” “securitybased swap dealer” “major swap participant” and “major securitybased swap participant” comerica has determined that neither it nor its subsidiaries are within the definition of “swap dealer” or “major swap participant” but some portions of the title vii regulations apply nonetheless one of these regulations centers on limiting certain otc transactions to “eligible contract participants” this may have an impact on the small business customers of comericas banking subsidiaries by making such customers ineligible for swap derivatives as hedging in their loan agreements 

consumer finance regulations  the cfpb has commenced issuing several new rules to implement various provisions of the financial reform act that were specifically identified as being enforced by the cfpb as well as those specified for supervisory and enforcement authority for very large depository institutions and nondepository nonbank entities comerica is subject to cfpb foreign remittance rules and home mortgage lending rules in addition to certain other cfpb rules 

the foreign remittance rules fall under section 1073 of the financial reform act the cfpb has issued new rules making changes to regulation e which implements the electronic fund transfer act these rules are designed to provide protections to consumers who transfer funds to recipients located in another country remittance transfers in general the rule requires remittance transfer providers such as comerica to disclose to a consumer the exchange rate fees and amount to be received by the recipient when the consumer sends a remittance transfer the effective date of the final rule has been extended and will go into effect on a date yet to be determined 

on january 10 2013 the cfpb issued three major rules relating to home mortgage loans the first rule amends regulation z to implement amendments made by sections 1461 and 1462 of the financial reform act regulation z currently requires creditors to establish escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling the rule implements statutory changes that lengthen the period of time for which the mandatory escrow must be maintained and exempts certain transactions from the requirement the stated effective date of the rule is june 1 2013 

the second rule expands the universe of loans subject to the home ownership and equity protection act “hoepa” most types of loans secured a consumers principal dwelling including purchase money loans and home equity lines of credit are potentially subject to the rule the existing triggers or tests for coverage are revised and a new prepayment penalty trigger for hoepa coverage is added the rule also implements new restrictions and requirements concerning loan terms and origination practices for mortgage loans that are within hoepas coverage the stated effective date is january 10 2014 

the third rule issued on january 10 2013 is another amendment to regulation z this rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the financial reform act which generally require creditors to make a reasonable good faith determination of a consumers ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling excluding an openend credit plan timeshare plan reverse mortgage or temporary loan and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages” the rule also implements section 1414 of the financial reform act which limits prepayment penalties finally the rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated the stated effective date is january 10 2014 

future legislation and regulatory measures 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comericas longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrowers ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration   

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrowers business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comericas risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comericas credit policies provide individual relationship managers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comericas legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines 

require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comericas chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrowers operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below 

 commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comericas cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate investors and developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comericas cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comericas consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrowers personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores a type of credit score used to assess an applicants credit risk and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loan programs although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we generally consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comericas expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” opportunity initiative “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” on course “trend” “objective” looks forward and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov  or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy costs fuel prices state and local municipal budget deficits the european debt crisis and government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with the impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comericas earnings 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb board affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 global capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility and disruption disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit comericas ability to access capital and manage liquidity which may adversely affect comericas business financial condition and results of operations further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in march 2012 moodys investors service downgraded comericas longterm and shortterm senior credit ratings one notch to a3 and p2 respectively in july 2012 fitch ratings revised comericas outlook to “negative” from “stable” while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas 

profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

in particular congress and other regulators have recently increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry 

during the second quarter of 2009 the fdic levied an industrywide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agencys efforts to rebuild dif in november 2009 the fdic amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 20102012 the prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first the fdic is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the riskbased assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter thus comerica may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits additional information on the impact of the fdics riskbased deposit premium assessment system is presented in “fdic insurance assessments” in the “supervisory and regulation” section 

on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a financial crisis responsibility fee on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system as the proposal is understood the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica 

on july 21 2010 the financial reform act was signed into law the financial reform act implements a variety of farreaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the 1930s many of the provisions of the financial reform act will directly affect or have directly affected comericas ability to conduct its business some of the key provisions of financial reform act include but are not limited to the following 

• creation of the fsoc that may recommend to the frb enhanced prudential standards including increasingly strict rules for capital leverage liquidity risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity 

• application of the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies such as comerica which among other things will after a threeyear phasein period which begins january 1 2013 remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding companys tier 1 capital 

• increases in the fdic assessment for depository institutions with assets of 10 billion or more such as comerica bank and increases the minimum reserve ratio for the fdics deposit insurance fund from 115 to 135 

• repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 

• establishment of a cfpb with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and for bank holding companies with 10 billion or more in assets to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws 

• restrictions on banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and private equity fund sponsorship and investment activities 

• created a new framework for the regulation of otc derivatives activities and 

• enactment of rules limiting debitcard interchange fees 

additional information on the changes to interchange fees the volcker rule and enhanced prudential requirements is set forth in “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” of the “supervisory and regulation” section for more information on the financial reform act please refer to “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” of the “supervision and regulation” section above many provisions in the financial reform act remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and implementation the effects of which are not yet known 

the bcbs issued the basel iii capital framework in december 2010 which significantly increases regulatory capital requirements the basel iii capital standards as well as strict new liquidity requirements adopted by the bcbs will be phased in over a period of several years and are now subject to individual adoption by member nations including the us further information concerning the basel iii framework is set forth in “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” of the “supervisory and regulation” section 

on november 22 2011 the frb issued a final rule requiring toptier us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review and issued instructions regarding stress testing as part of the 2012 capital plan review program under the rule the frb will annually evaluate institutions capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases as required comerica submitted its 2012 capital plan to the frb on january 9 2012 on march 14 2012 comerica announced that the frb had completed its 2012 capital plan review and did not object to the 2012 capital plan or capital distributions contemplated in such plan also as required comerica submitted its 2013 capital plan to the frb on january 7 2013 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the 2013 plan by midmarch 2013 

on may 21 2012 the department of the treasury published final regulations to implement beginning july 20 2012 a semiannual assessment scheme for covering expenses of the ofr based on the asset size of each assessed company as of the end of the preceding year 

the effects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be fully determined at this time moreover as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown any delay in the economic recovery or a worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect comerica we can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comericas businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of the acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise 

adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica 

 as discussed above the financial reform act creates a fsoc that may recommend to the frb enhanced capital requirements for financial institutions as they grow in size and complexity and imposes higher riskbased capital and leverage requirements which among other things will after a threeyear phasein period beginning in january 1 2013 remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of tier 1 capital moreover the capital requirements applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to comericas subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the financial reform act these requirements and any other new regulations could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks also are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with recently proposed supervisory guidance basel iii and the requirements of the financial reform act in light of these new legal and regulatory requirements comerica and our subsidiary banks may be required to satisfy additional more stringent liquidity standards including for the first time quantitative standards for liquidity management we cannot fully predict at this time the final form of or the effects of these regulations additional information on the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section 

the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators however maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions and supply chain factors any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or 

telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved 

in particular comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica also faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure while comerica has selected these third party vendors carefully it does not control their operations as such any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect comericas business and operations 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyber attacks spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these 

relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on april 14 2011 frb occ and several other federal financial regulators issued a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the financial reform act section 956 requires the regulators to issue regulations that prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the financial reform act the proposed rule would not apply to institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and would impose heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred over a minimum period of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions would be required to identify employees who have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance and to determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation as other financial institutions as referenced above may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market and liquidity operational compliance business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods these types of natural catastrophic events at times have 

disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comericas operating results 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f42 through f47 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f55 through f63 of the financial section of this report

 item 3 legal proceedings 

comerica and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations comerica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and with respect to such legal proceedings intends to continue to defend itself vigorously litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what is in the best interests of comerica and its shareholders settlement may result from comericas determination that it may be more prudent financially to settle rather than litigate and should not be regarded as an admission of liability on at least a quarterly basis comerica assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available on a casebycase basis reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred either as a result of a settlement or judgment and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher 

or lower than the amounts reserved based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management believes that current reserves are adequate and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on comerica’s consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows 

for other matters where a loss is not probable comerica has not established legal reserves in determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss comerica reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis in conjunction with legal counsel in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments based on current knowledge expectation of future earnings and after consultation with legal counsel management believes the maximum amount of reasonably possible losses would not have a material adverse effect on comericas consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows 

the damages alleged by plaintiffs or claimants may be overstated unsubstantiated by legal theory unsupported by the facts andor bear no relation to the ultimate award that a court jury or agency might impose in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters comerica cannot state with confidence a range of reasonably possible losses nor what the eventual outcome of these matters will be however based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management believes the maximum amount of reasonably possible losses would not have a material adverse effect on comerica’s consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows 

in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to comericas consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows

comerica has consolidated most of its former banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas arizona california florida and michigan 

dividends

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia “prompt corrective action” regime discussed below comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are specifically prohibited from paying dividends if payment would result in the bank becoming “undercapitalized” in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

additionally the payment of dividends is subject to approval by the frb pursuant to the capital plan review program for more information please see “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” in this section 

source of strength  crossguarantee requirements 

federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2011 comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions bank holding companies that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2011 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1041  and 1425  of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to nonriskadjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comerica’s leverage ratio of 1092  at december 31 2011 reflects the nature of comerica’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy at december 31 2011 comerica bank had tier 1 and total capital equal to 1047 and 1404 of its total riskweighted assets respectively and a leverage ratio of 1098 additional information on the calculation of comerica and its bank subsidiaries tier 1 capital total capital and riskweighted assets is set forth in note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f109 through f110 of the financial section of this report 

fdic insurance assessments 

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system which was amended pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 and further amended by the financial reform act due to the passage of the financial reform act the fdic was required to redefine the deposit insurance assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity and make changes to assessment rate methodology the fdic adopted a final rule on february 7 2011 that revised the riskbased assessment system for all large insured depository institutions the first assessment under the new rule was paid in the third quarter of 2011 

in november 2009 the fdic required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 through 2012 the prepaid assessments are applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first comerica paid such prepaid assessment of 200 million on december 30 2009 for 2011 fdic insurance assessments totaled 48 million the remaining prepayment at december 31 2011 was 116 million against which 2012 dif assessments will be applied 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

capital purchase program 

on november 14 2008 comerica entered the capital purchase program by issuing to the united states department of the treasury “us treasury” in exchange for aggregate consideration of 225 billion 1 225 million shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series f no par value the “series f preferred stock” and 2 a warrant to purchase 11479592 shares of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share the “warrant” both the series f preferred stock and the warrant were accounted for as components of comericas regulatory tier 1 capital and contained terms and limitations imposed by the us treasury on march 17 2010 comerica fully redeemed the series f preferred stock previously issued to the us treasury and comerica exited the capital purchase program the warrant was separated into 11479592 warrants to purchase one share of comericas common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share and such warrants are now listed and traded on the nyse as a result of participating in the capital purchase program comerica was subject to certain executive compensation and corporate governance standards promulgated by the us treasury prior to redemption which no longer applied to comerica following the redemption

temporary liquidity guarantee program 

among other programs and actions taken by the us regulatory agencies during the financial crisis the fdic implemented in 2008 the temporary liquidity guarantee program “tlgp” to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system the tlgp was comprised of the debt guarantee program “dgp” and the transaction account guarantee program “tagp” the dgp temporarily guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt eg promissory notes unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on october 14 2008 and continuing through october 31 2009 for eligible debt issued by that date the fdic provided the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or december 31 2012 or june 30 2012 for debt issued prior to april 1 2009 the tagp offered a temporary full guarantee for noninterestbearing transaction accounts held at participating fdicinsured depository institutions the unlimited deposit coverage was available beginning october 14 2008 and was in addition to the 250000 fdic deposit insurance coverage per account that was included as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 participation in both the dgp and the tagp was voluntary 

comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association participated in the tlgp as of december 31 2011 comerica had no senior unsecured debt outstanding under the dgp comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association voluntarily participated in the tagp from october 2008 until they opted out effective july 1 2010 the tagp expired as of december 31 2010

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act

and an overhaul of the legislative and regulatory landscape with the passage of the financial reform act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 the financial reform act provides for among other matters increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions provided below is an overview of key elements of the financial reform act relevant to comerica most of the provisions contained in the financial reform act became effective immediately upon enactment however many have delayed effective dates implementation of the financial reform act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

• the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” will coordinate efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns and will make recommendations to the frb as to enhanced prudential standards that must apply to large interconnected bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies supervised by the frb under the financial reform act including capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements as a bank holding company with total consolidated assets exceeding 50 billion comerica will be subject to these enhanced prudential requirements 

• the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb“ granted broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions including the authority to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive” acts and practices possesses examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than 10 billion in assets

• unlimited deposit insurance extension provides unlimited deposit insurance on noninterestbearing accounts from december 31 2010 to december 31 2012 

• deposit insurance changed the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity increased the deposit insurance funds minimum reserve ratio and permanently increased general deposit insurance coverage from 100000 to 250000

the environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot now be foreseen the financial reform act will have important implications for comerica and the entire financial services industry as the financial reform act requires that many studies be conducted and that hundreds of regulations be written in order to fully implement it the full impact of this legislation on comerica its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years 

other recent legislative and regulatory developments 

overdraft fees  on november 12 2009 the federal reserve adopted amendments to its regulation e effective july 1 2010 that prohibit financial institutions from charging clients overdraft fees on automated teller machines “atm” and onetime debit card transactions unless a consumer consents or opts in to the overdraft service for those type of transactions pursuant to the adopted regulation clients must optin to an overdraft service in order for the financial institution to collect overdraft fees if a consumer does not opt in any atm transaction or debit that overdraws the consumers account will be denied overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this rule before opting in the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institutions overdraft services including the fees associated with the service and the consumers choices financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms conditions and features including pricing that they provide to consumers who do opt in 

financial crisis responsibility fee  on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee the “financial crisis responsibility fee” on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system if implemented as initially proposed the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica the financial crisis responsibility fee was not included in the financial reform act on february 14 2011 the administration included a revised financial crisis responsibility fee in its proposed fiscal 2012 budget on february 1 2012 the obama administration proposed to use a portion of the financial crisis responsibility fee to provide certain eligible homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments with an opportunity to refinance 

incentivebased compensation  in june 2010 the frb occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors the federal reserve will review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 

on april 14 2011 frb occ and several other federal financial regulators approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the financial reform act section 956 prohibits incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses this proposal is consistent with and builds on the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june 2010 consistent with the financial reform act the proposed rule does not apply to banks with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and contains heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule requires that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred for a minimum of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions must identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to substantial risk and must determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards 

basel iii regulatory capital and liquidity regime  in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation basel iii the basel iii capital framework includes higher global minimum capital standards including a more stringent definition of capital new capital conservation buffers and a minimum tier 1 common capital ratio the basel iii capital framework also proposes the 

deduction of certain assets from capital including deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights among others and within prescribed limitations as well as the inclusion of other comprehensive income in capital and increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk rules are expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019 adoption in the us is expected to occur over a similar timeframe but the final form of the us rules is not yet known 

the basel iii liquidity framework includes two minimum liquidity measures the liquidity coverage ratio requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of highquality liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30day systematic liquidity stress scenario the net stable funding ratio requires the amount of available longerterm stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longerterm stable funding over a oneyear period comericas liquidity position is strong but if subject to the basel iii liquidity framework as currently proposed comerica would need to implement additional liquidity management initiatives while uncertainty exists in both the final form of the basel iii guidance and whether or not comerica will be required to adopt the guidelines comerica is closely monitoring the development of the guidance comerica expects to meet the final requirements adopted by us banking regulators within regulatory timelines 

interchange fees  on july 20 2011 the frb published final rules pursuant to the financial reform act establishing the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction the restrictions on interchange transaction fees do not apply to issuers with assets of less than 10 billion 

the volcker rule  the federal banking agencies and the sec published proposed regulations to implement the volcker rule on november 7 2011 the proposal adopts a multifaceted approach to implementing the volcker rule prohibitions that relies on i detailed descriptions of prohibited and permitted activities ii detailed compliance requirements and iii for banking entities with large volumes of trading activity detailed quantitative analysis and reporting obligations in addition to rules implementing the core prohibitions and exemptions of the volcker rule the proposal also includes three appendices devoted to recordkeeping and reporting requirements including numerous quantitative data reporting obligations for banking entities with significant trading activities appendix a detailed guidance regarding trading undertaken in connection with market making activities appendix b and enhanced compliance requirements for banking entities with significant trading or covered fund activities appendix c comerica is closely monitoring the development of the volcker rule and expects to meet the final requirements adopted by regulators within regulatory timelines 

annual capital plans  on november 22 2011 the frb issued a final rule requiring toptier us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review and issued instructions regarding stress testing as part of the 2012 capital plan review program under the rule the frb will annually evaluate institutions capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases as required comerica submitted its capital plan to the frb on january 9 2012 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the plan by midmarch 

enhanced prudential requirements  on december 20 2011 the frb issued its proposed regulations to implement the enhanced prudential and supervisory requirements mandated by the financial reform act the proposed regulations address enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements singlecounterparty credit limits semiannual stress tests and a debttoequity limit for companies determined to pose a grave threat to financial stability they are intended to allow regulators to more effectively supervise large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms whose failure could impact the stability of the us financial system and generally build on existing us and international regulatory guidance the proposal also takes a multistage or phased approach to many of the requirements such as the capital and liquidity requirements most of these requirements will apply to comerica because it has consolidated assets of more than 50 billion however the proposal defers several key aspects of the new enhanced requirements to future proposals as a result the full impact of these enhanced standards on comerica and its competitors cannot yet be fully assessed 

ofr assessments  on january 3 2012 the department of the treasury published proposed regulations to implement beginning july 20 2012 a semiannual assessment scheme for covering expenses of the ofr based on the asset size of each assessed company as of the end of the preceding year 

future legislation and regulatory measures 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict 

whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comerica’s longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other financial institutions loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrower’s ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration 

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrower’s business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comerica’s risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comerica’s credit policies provide individual loan officers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comerica’s legal lending limit credit administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comerica’s chief credit officer and comprising senior credit market and risk management executives 

commercial loan portfolio 

commercial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower’s operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below 

 

 commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comerica’s cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate investors and developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comerica’s cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are influenced by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comerica’s consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrower’s personal financial condition including a review of credit reports and related fico scores and verification of income and assets comerica does not originate subprime loan programs although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we consider subprime fico scores to be those below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans residential mortgage loans retained in the portfolio are largely relationship based the remaining loans are typically eligible to be sold on the secondary market adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 comerica and its subsidiaries had 9037  fulltime and 720  parttime employees

 item 1a risk factors 

this report includes forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition comerica may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements all statements regarding comerica’s expected financial position strategies and growth prospects and general economic conditions comerica expects to exist in the future are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipates” “believes” “feels” “expects” “estimates” “seeks” “strives” “plans” “intends” “outlook” “forecast” “position” “target” “mission” “assume” “achievable” “potential” “strategy” “goal” “aspiration” opportunity initiative “outcome” “continue” “remain” “maintain” on course “trend” “objective” looks forward and variations of such words and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will” “would” “should” “could” “might” “can” “may” or similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comerica’s sec reports accessible on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov  or on comerica’s website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

 local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy costs fuel prices state and local municipal budget deficits the european debt crisis and government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with the impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s earnings 

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve board affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comerica’s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comerica’s control and difficult to predict comerica’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 global capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility and disruption disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit comerica’s ability to access capital and manage liquidity which may adversely affect comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations further comerica’s customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in december 2011 moodys investors service placed comerica on review for a possible downgrade a downgrade to comerica or its subsidiaries credit ratings could affect its ability to access the capital markets increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability a ratings downgrade to comerica its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities to comerica under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase comericas costs or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold 

 comerica’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of 

trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comerica’s credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the sec and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

in particular congress and other regulators have recently increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry 

during the second quarter of 2009 the fdic levied an industrywide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agencys efforts to rebuild dif in november 2009 the fdic amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 20102012 the prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first the fdic is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the riskbased assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter thus comerica may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits additional information on the impact of the fdics riskbased deposit premium assessment system is presented in “fdic insurance assessments” in the “supervisory and regulation” section 

on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a financial crisis responsibility fee on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system if implemented as initially proposed the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica on february 14 2011 the administration included a revised financial crisis responsibility fee in its proposed fiscal 2012 budget on february 1 2012 the obama administration proposed to use a portion of the financial crisis responsibility fee to provide certain eligible homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments with an opportunity to refinance 

on july 21 2010 the financial reform act was signed into law the financial reform act implements a variety of farreaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the 1930s many of the provisions of the financial reform act will directly affect or have directly affected comericas ability to conduct its business including but not limited to 

• creation of the fsoc that may recommend to the frb enhanced prudential standards including increasingly strict rules for capital leverage liquidity risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity 

• application of the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies such as comerica which among other things will after a threeyear phasein period which begins january 1 2013 remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding companys tier 1 capital 

• increases in the fdic assessment for depository institutions with assets of 10 billion or more such as comerica bank and increases the minimum reserve ratio for the fdics deposit insurance fund from 115 to 135 

• repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 

• establishment of a cfpb with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and for bank holding companies with 10 billion or more in assets to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws 

• restrictions on banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and private fund sponsorship and investment activities 

• created a new framework for the regulation of otc derivatives activities and 

• enactment of rules limiting debitcard interchange fees 

additional information on the changes to interchange fees the volcker rule and enhanced prudential requirements is set forth in “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” of the “supervisory and regulation” section for more information on the financial reform act please refer to “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” of the “supervision and regulation” section above many provisions in the financial reform act remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and implementation the effects of which are not yet known 

the bcbs issued the basel iii capital framework in december 2010 which significantly increases regulatory capital requirements the basel iii capital standards as well as strict new liquidity requirements adopted by the bcbs will be phased in over a period of several years and are now subject to individual adoption by member nations including the united states further information concerning the basel iii framework is set forth in “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” of the “supervisory and regulation” section 

on november 22 2011 the frb issued a final rule requiring toptier us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review and issued instructions regarding stress testing as part of the 2012 capital plan review program under the rule the frb will annually evaluate institutions capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases as required comerica submitted its capital plan to the frb on january 9 2012 and expects to receive the results of the frbs review of the plan by midmarch 

on january 3 2012 the department of the treasury published proposed regulations to implement beginning july 20 2012 a semiannual assessment scheme for covering expenses of the ofr based on the asset size of each assessed company as of the end of the preceding year 

the effects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be fully determined at this time moreover as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown any delay in the economic recovery or a worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect comerica we can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comericas businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comerica’s financial results 

 comerica completed the acquisition of sterling on july 28 2011 and completed systems integrations on november 14 2011 difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the sterling acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected 

further the assimilation of comericas and sterlings customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of sterling or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future acquisitions or decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of the corporation 

 as discussed above the financial reform act creates a fsoc that may recommend to the frb enhanced capital requirements for financial institutions as they grow in size and complexity and imposes higher riskbased capital and leverage requirements which among other things will after a threeyear phasein period beginning in january 1 2013 remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of tier 1 capital moreover the capital requirements applicable to us as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with basel iii and the requirements of the financial reform act these requirements and any other new regulations could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica as a bank holding company as well as to our subsidiary banks also are in the process of being substantially revised in connection with recently proposed supervisory guidance basel iii and the requirements of the financial reform act in light of these new legal and regulatory requirements comerica and our subsidiary banks may be required to satisfy additional more stringent liquidity standards including for the first time quantitative standards for liquidity management we cannot fully predict at this time the final form of or the effects of these regulations additional information on the liquidity requirements applicable to comerica is set forth in the “supervision and regulation” section 

the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators however maintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations 

 comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the energy industry the automotive production industry and the real estate business these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions and supply chain factors any decline in one of those customers businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 comerica has announced a 2012 profit improvement plan that focuses on revenue enhancements and expense reduction initiatives the estimates and assumptions underlying the profit improvement plan may or may not prove to be accurate in some respects additionally comericas 2012 performance is subject to the various risks inherent to its 

business and operations there may be delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings plans and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement them and some benefits may not be fully achieved furthermore the implementation of the profit improvement plan may have unintended impacts on comericas ability to attract and retain business and customers while revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace accordingly comericas results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted making it less competitive and potentially causing the loss of market share 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders failure of comericas controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions given the high volume of transactions at comerica certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved 

in particular comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems 

comerica also faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its business infrastructure while comerica has selected these third party vendors carefully it does not control their operations as such any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect comericas business and operations 

comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses cyberattacks spikes in transaction volume andor customer activity electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica 

the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica 

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions’ net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance 

premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comerica’s financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comerica’s control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comerica’s ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

further as we have seen recently difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comerica’s earnings 

 comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on april 14 2011 frb occ and several other federal financial regulators approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the financial reform act section 956 prohibits incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the financial reform act the proposed rule does not apply to banks with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and contains heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule requires that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred for a minimum of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions must identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to substantial risk and must determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation as other financial institutions as referenced above may not be subject to the same requirements 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comerica’s efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comerica’s regulators that could materially adversely affect comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market and liquidity operational compliance business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comerica’s operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comerica’s operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comerica’s stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comerica’s common stock 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy comerica’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to comerica’s property in addition catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on comericas customers and in turn on comerica a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comerica’s operating results 

 from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comerica’s financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 

 accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports the financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 

management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established 

detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see “critical accounting policies” on pages f43 through f48 of the financial section of this report and note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f55 through f63 of the financial section of this report

 item 3 legal proceedings 

comerica and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations comerica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and with respect to such legal proceedings intends to continue to defend itself vigorously litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what is in the best interests of comerica and its shareholders on at least a quarterly basis comerica assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available on a casebycase basis reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management believes that current reserves are adequate and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on comerica’s consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows however in the event of significant unexpected future developments on existing cases it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to comericas consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows 

for other matters where a loss is not probable comerica has not established legal reserves in determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss comerica reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis in conjunction with legal counsel in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments based on current knowledge expectation of future earnings and after consultation with legal counsel management believes the maximum amount of reasonably possible losses would not have a material adverse effect on comericas consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows however in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters if unfavorable may be material to comericas consolidated financial condition consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows 

the damages alleged by plaintiffs or claimants may be overstated unsubstantiated by legal theory unsupported by the facts andor bear no relation to the ultimate award that a court jury or agency might impose in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters comerica cannot state with confidence a range of reasonably possible losses nor what the eventual outcome of these matters will be however based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management believes the maximum amount of reasonably possible losses would not have a material adverse effect on

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica’s banking subsidiaries compete primarily with banks based in its primary areas of operations in the united states for loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona california colorado delaware florida illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota north carolina nevada new jersey new york ohio tennessee texas virginia and washington comerica competes with other financial institutions for various deposits loans andor other products and services 

based on the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “interstate act” and the grammleachbliley act as described below comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will increase in the future in addition to banks comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while strengthening the franchises of acquirers 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed 

comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking travel agent services and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking comerica bank is a member of the federal reserve system “frs” and supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” comerica bank  trust national association is also a member of the frs the deposits of comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica capital markets corporation the office of 

  

financial and insurance services of the state of michigan in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission in the case of comerica securities inc comerica capital markets corporation and world asset management inc 

in most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval however is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a financial or bank holding company or a bank comerica’s current rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” is “outstanding” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities in addition comerica is “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and the frb’s regulation w limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and its affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve board from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on armslength terms the financial reform act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization for example commencing in july 2011 the financial reform act will require that the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries 

set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its domestic banks and other subsidiaries the summaries are not complete are qualified in their entirety by references to the particular statutes and regulations and are not intended as legal advice a change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of comerica 

interstate banking and branching 

the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” as amended by the financial reform act permits a bank holding company with federal reserve board approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of 

  

deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations the “host” state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases the doddfrank act expanded the de novo interstate branching authority of banks beyond what had been permitted under the interstate act by eliminating the requirement that a state expressly “optin” to de novo branching in favor of a rule that de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch effective july 21 2011 the doddfrank act also requires that a bank holding company or bank be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged rather than simply adequately capitalized and adequately managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions 

as permitted by the interstate act comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas michigan california florida and arizona 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such bank’s retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january 1 2011 comerica’s subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 364 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comerica’s subsidiary banks declared dividends of 28 million in 2010 49 million in 2009 and 264 million in 2008 without the need for prior governmental approvals 

further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

source of strength 

frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions 

  

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2010 comerica and its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

  

for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions bank holding companies that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2010 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1013 and 1454 of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comerica’s leverage ratio of 1126 at december 31 2010 reflects the nature of comerica’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdic insurance assessments 

comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the deposit insurance fund “dif” additionally from the fourth quarter of 2008 through june 30 2010 comerica and its subsidiary banks elected to participate in the fdic’s transaction account guarantee program that requires the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic in april 2010 the fdic adopted an interim rule extending the transaction account guarantee program “tagp” through december 31 2010 for financial institutions that desired to continue tagp participation comerica and its subsidiary banks elected to optout of the fdic’s tagp extension effective july 1 2010 in july 2010 the financial reform act reinstated for all financial institutions unlimited deposit insurance on noninterestbearing accounts for the period from december 31 2010 through december 31 2012 

as of december 31 2010 comerica’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 40 billion of difassessable deposits prior to 2007 comerica’s banking subsidiaries had not paid nor been assessed deposit insurance assessments on difassessable deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system the fdic’s risk related assessment system was revised effective january 1 2007 however and comerica’s banking subsidiaries were assessed deposit insurance premiums on a quarterly basis beginning in june 2007 in 2008 these assessment premiums totaled 268 million and were first applied against the remaining credit of 171 million during the second quarter of 2009 the fdic levied an industrywide special assessment charge on 

  

insured financial institutions as part of the agency’s efforts to rebuild dif in november 2009 the fdic amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 20102012 the prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first comerica paid such prepaid assessment on december 30 2009 along with its regular quarterly riskbased deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of 2009 in 2009 these assessment premiums totaled 281 million including the second quarter special assessment of 29 million and prepaid assessments of 200 million which includes assessments that will be expensed by comerica during 20102012 in 2010 the assessment premiums applied against the prepayment totaled 50 million the remaining prepayment at december 31 2010 was 150 million against which 2011 and 2012 dif assessments will be applied 

in addition on january 12 2010 the fdic announced that it would seek public comment on whether financial institutions with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such financial institutions would otherwise be charged 

the fdic is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the riskbased assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter thus comerica may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

capital purchase program 

pursuant to the capital purchase program on november 14 2008 comerica issued to the us treasury in exchange for aggregate consideration of 225 billion 1 225 million shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock series f no par value the “series f preferred stock” and 2 a warrant to purchase 11479592 shares of comerica’s common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share the “warrant” the number of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the warrant and the exercise price of the warrant are subject to antidilution and other adjustments from time to time following among other things stock splits subdivisions or combinations certain issuances of common stock or convertible securities and certain repurchases of common stock the series f preferred stock a had a liquidation amount per share equal to 1000 for an aggregate value of 225 billion and b paid a cumulative annual dividend of five percent 5 for the first five years and nine percent 9 on an annual basis thereafter the warrant expires ten years from the issuance date both the series f preferred stock and the warrant were accounted for as components of comerica’s regulatory tier 1 capital the letter agreement between the us treasury and comerica dated november 14 2008 including the securities purchase agreement the “purchase agreement” concerning the issuance and sale of the series f preferred stock and the warrant granted the holders of the series f preferred stock the warrant and comerica common stock to be issued under the warrant certain registration rights and imposed restrictions on dividend and stock repurchases for example during comerica’s participation in the capital purchase program comerica was limited without the consent of the us treasury in its ability to i increase its quarterly dividend above 033 per common share the quarterly dividend rate in effect as of november 14 2008 or ii repurchase any of its shares with limited exceptions most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans in addition the terms of purchase agreement subjected comerica to certain executive compensation limitations as set forth in the eesa 

  

on march 17 2010 comerica fully redeemed the series f preferred stock previously issued to the us treasury and comerica exited the capital purchase program also in may 2010 comerica registered the warrant with the securities and exchange commission and the us treasury auctioned the warrant to the public prior to such registration and public sale the warrant was separated into 11479592 warrants to purchase one share of comerica’s common stock at an exercise price of 2940 per share the warrants are listed and traded on the new york stock exchange for additional details about the capital purchase program please refer to pages 36 through 38 under the caption “capital” and note 14 on pages 117 through 118 of the consolidated financial statements contained in comerica’s annual report to shareholders for the year ended december 31 2010 

temporary liquidity guarantee program 

among other programs and actions taken by the us regulatory agencies during the financial crisis the fdic implemented the temporary liquidity guarantee program “tlgp” to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system the tlgp was comprised of the debt guarantee program “dgp” and the transaction account guarantee program “tagp” the dgp guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt eg promissory notes unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on october 14 2008 and continuing through october 31 2009 for eligible debt issued by that date the fdic provided the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or december 31 2012 or june 30 2012 for debt issued prior to april 1 2009 the tagp offered full guarantee for noninterestbearing transaction accounts held at fdicinsured depository institutions the unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to the 250000 fdic deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the eesa the tagp coverage became effective on october 14 2008 

initially the tlgp programs the dgp and tagp were provided at no cost for the first 30 days on november 3 2008 the fdic extended the optout period to december 5 2008 to provide eligible institutions additional time to consider the terms before making a final decision regarding participation in the program through december 31 2009 on december 5 2008 comerica announced that it and two of its subsidiaries comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association formally elected to continue their participation in the tlgp participants in the dgp were charged an annualized fee ranging from 50 basis points bps to 100 bps depending on the maturity of the debt issued multiplied by the amount of debt issued and calculated for the maturity period of that debt or through june 30 2012 whichever is earlier based on the terms of the dgp comerica bank could have issued up to approximately 52 billion of qualifying senior debt securities covered by the dgp as of december 31 2010 there is no senior unsecured debt outstanding under the dgp 

effective october 1 2009 in order to assure an orderly phase out of the tagp fdic extended the tagp for six months until june 30 2010 any insured depository institution that was participating in the tag program as of october 1 2009 was permitted to continue in the tagp during the extension period that ends on june 30 2010 the annual assessment rate that applied to participating institutions during the extension period is either 15 basis points 20 basis points or 25 basis points depending on the “risk category” assigned to the institution under the fdic’s riskbased premium system any institution participating in the tag program as of october 1 2009 that desired to opt out of the tag extension was required to submit its optout election to the fdic on or before november 2 2009 and any such election to opt out was effective on january 1 2010 in april 2010 the fdic adopted an interim rule extending the tagp through december 31 2010 for financial institutions that desired to continue tagp participation comerica comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association elected to opt out of such tagp’s extension period so they ceased to participate in the tagp as of july 1 2010 

however in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “financial reform act” reinstated for all financial institutions unlimited deposit insurance on noninterestbearing and 

  

certain interestbearing demand deposit accounts for the period from december 31 2010 through december 31 2012 for further discussion of the financial reform act refer to “the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act” section below in this “supervisory and regulation” section 

for additional details about the temporary liquidity guarantee program see pages 35 and 36 under the caption “deposits and borrowed funds” 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

due to the recent financial crisis there have been significant changes in the competitive landscape of the financial services industry and an overhaul of the legislative and regulatory landscape with the passage of the financial reform act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 the financial reform act provides for among other matters increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions provided below is an overview of key elements of the financial reform act relevant to comerica most of the provisions contained in the financial reform act became effective immediately upon enactment however many have delayed effective dates implementation of the financial reform act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years the estimates of the impact on comerica discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

the financial reform act also 

 

  

  

  

 the environment in which financial institutions will operate after the recent financial crisis including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities corporate governance and compensation and changes in fiscal policy may have longterm effects on the business model and profitability of financial institutions that cannot now be foreseen 

other recent legislative and regulatory developments 

in response to global credit and liquidity issues involving a number of financial institutions the united states government particularly the united states department of the treasury the “us treasury” and the fdic have taken a variety of extraordinary measures over the last couple years designed to restore confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions including capital injections guarantees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of illiquid assets from banks moreover the environment in which banking organizations are operating after the financial crisis has been impacted by recent developments including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital liquidity supervision permissible activities and corporate governance and compensation 

on october 3 2008 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 the “eesa” was signed into law pursuant to the eesa the us treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets and has proposed several programs including the purchase by the us treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions the “troubled asset relief program” and the direct purchase by the us treasury of equity of healthy financial institutions the “capital purchase program” the eesa also temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the fdic from 100000 to 250000 per depositor 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the “arra” was signed into law section 7001 of the arra amended section 111 of the eesa in its entirety on june 10 2009 the us treasury released an interim final rule the “ifr” effective june 15 2009 that provided guidance on the compensation and governance standards for troubled asset relief program “tarp” recipients and promulgated regulations to implement the restrictions and standards set forth in section 7001 of the arra among other things the ifr and arra significantly expanded the executive compensation restrictions previously imposed by the eesa such restrictions apply to any entity that has received or will receive financial 

  

assistance under tarp and shall generally continue to apply for as long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under tarp including preferred stock issued under the capital purchase program remains outstanding as a result of our participation in the capital purchase program the restrictions and standards set forth in section 7001 of the arra as well as the ifr promulgated by the us treasury were applicable to comerica prior to the redemption of the series f preferred stock on march 17 2010 

on may 20 2009 the helping families save their homes act of 2009 which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the fdic to 250000 per depositor through december 31 2013 was signed into law this extension of the temporary 250000 coverage limit pursuant to the eesa became effective immediately upon the president’s signature the legislation provides that the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the fdic will return to 100000 on january 1 2014 

on october 22 2009 the federal reserve issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies the “incentive compensation proposal” intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking this guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related riskmanagement control and governance processes the incentive compensation proposal which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon three primary principles i balanced risktaking incentives ii compatibility with effective controls and risk management and iii strong corporate governance any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions in addition under the incentive compensation proposal the federal reserve in appropriate circumstances may take enforcement action against a banking organization 

on november 12 2009 the federal reserve adopted amendments to its regulation e effective july 1 2010 that prohibit financial institutions from charging clients overdraft fees on automated teller machines “atm” and onetime debit card transactions unless a consumer consents or opts in to the overdraft service for those type of transactions pursuant to the adopted regulation clients must optin to an overdraft service in order for the financial institution to collect overdraft fees if a consumer does not opt in any atm transaction or debit that overdraws the consumer’s account will be denied overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this new rule before opting in the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services including the fees associated with the service and the consumer’s choices financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms conditions and features including pricing that they provide to consumers who do opt in 

on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee the “financial crisis responsibility fee” on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system if implemented as initially proposed the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica the financial crisis responsibility fee was not included in the financial reform act on february 14 2011 the administration included a revised financial crisis responsibility fee in its proposed fiscal 2012 budget 

effective july 1 2010 the federal reserve board amended regulation e to prohibit charging overdraft fees for atm or pointofsale debit card transactions unless the customer optsin to the overdraft service see above in “other recent legislative and regulatory developments” for more information on the regulation e amendments as previously adopted by the federal reserve on november 12 2009 

in june 2010 the federal reserve occ and fdic issued a comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do 

  

not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors the federal reserve will review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 

during the third quarter 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision revised the capital accord “basel iii” which narrows the definition of capital and increases capital requirements for specific exposures the new capital requirements will be phasedin over six years beginning in 2013 the final package of basel iii reforms was endorsed by g20 leaders on november 12 2010 and is subject to individual adoption by member nations including the united states if these revisions are adopted as endorsed we estimate they would have a negligible impact on our regulatory capital ratios based on our current understanding of the revisions to capital qualification however the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators we await clarification from our banking regulators on their interpretation of basel iii and any additional requirements to the stated thresholds 

on february 7 2011 the board of directors of the fdic approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the financial reform act although the fdic board acted on the proposal on february 7 2011 the proposal is a joint rule making by the five federal members of the federal financial institutions examination council fdic frs occ office of thrift supervision and national credit union administration the securities and exchange commission and the federal housing finance agency who must each independently approve the proposed rule before it is published in the federal register for comment section 956 prohibits incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the financial reform act the proposed rule does not apply to banks with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and contains heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the rule requires that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred for a minimum of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions must identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to substantial risk and must determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards the proposed rule would move the us closer to aspects of international compensation standards by i requiring deferral of a substantial portion of incentive compensation for executive officers of particularly large institutions described above ii prohibiting incentivebased compensation arrangements for covered persons that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation iii prohibiting incentivebased compensation arrangements for covered persons that would expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to a material financial loss iv requiring policies and procedures for incentivebased compensation arrangements that are commensurate with the size and complexity of the institution and v requiring annual reports on incentive compensation structures to the institution’s appropriate federal regulator 

  

future legislation 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

underwriting approach 

the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk so proper loan underwriting is critical to comerica’s longterm financial success comerica extends credit to businesses individuals and public entities based on sound lending principles and consistent with prudent banking practice during the loan underwriting process a qualitative and quantitative analysis of potential credit facilities is performed and the credit risks associated with each relationship are evaluated important factors considered as part of the underwriting process for new loans and loan renewals include 

 

  

  

  

  

 comerica prices credit facilities to reflect risk the related costs and the expected return while maintaining competitiveness with other banks loans with variable and fixed rates are underwritten to achieve expected riskadjusted returns on the credit facilities and for the full relationship including the borrower’s ability to repay the principal and interest based on such rates 

credit administration 

comerica maintains a credit administration department “credit administration” which is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of our loan portfolio credit administration assists with underwriting by providing objective financial analysis including an assessment of the borrower’s business model balance sheet cash flow and collateral each borrower relationship is assigned an internal risk rating by credit administration further credit administration updates the assigned internal risk rating for every borrower relationship as new information becomes available either as a result of periodic reviews of the credit quality or as a result of a change in borrower performance the goal of the internal risk rating framework is to improve comerica’s risk management capability including its ability to identify and manage changes in the credit risk profile of its portfolio predict future losses and price the loans appropriately for risk 

credit policy 

comerica maintains a comprehensive set of credit policies comerica’s credit policies provide individual loan officers as well as loan committees approval authorities based on our internal risk rating system and establish maximum exposure limits based on risk ratings and comerica’s legal lending limit credit 

  

administration in conjunction with the businesses units monitors compliance with the credit policies and modifies the existing policies as necessary new or modified policiesguidelines require approval by the strategic credit committee chaired by comerica’s chief credit officer and comprising senior credit and market executives 

commercial and industrial loan portfolio 

commercial and industrial loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower’s operations the underwriting process includes an analysis of some or all of the factors listed below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 commercial real estate cre loan portfolio 

comerica’s cre loan portfolio consists of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans and includes both loans to real estate investors and developers and loans secured by owneroccupied real estate comerica’s cre loan underwriting policies are consistent with the approach described above and provide maximum loantovalue ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan the loantovalue percentage varies by the type of collateral and is limited by advance rates established by our regulators our loantovalue limitations are in certain cases more restrictive than those required by regulators and are determined by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself cre loans generally require cash equity cre loans are normally originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners there are limitations to the size of a single project loan and to the aggregate dollar exposure to a single guarantor 

consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios 

comerica’s consumer and residential mortgage loans are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above but also includes an assessment of each borrower’s personal financial condition including verification of income assets and fico score comerica does not originate subprime loans although a standard industry definition for subprime loans including subprime mortgage loans does not exist comerica defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors these credit factors include low fico scores poor patterns of payment history high debttoincome ratios and elevated loantovalue we consider subprime fico scores to be those 

  

below 620 on a secured basis excluding loans with cash or nearcash collateral and adequate income to make payments and below 660 for unsecured loans adjustable rate loans are limited to standard conventional loan programs 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 comerica and its subsidiaries had 8636 fulltime and 729 parttime employees

 local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy costs fuel prices and government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s earnings 

  

 monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve board affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comerica’s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comerica’s control and difficult to predict comerica’s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

 

 global capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility and disruption disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit comerica’s ability to access capital and manage liquidity which may adversely affect comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations further comerica’s customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comerica’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 comerica’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comerica’s credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

 

 comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the united states department of treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the board of governors of the federal reserve system the securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comerica’s operations investigations and limitations related to comerica’s securities the classification of comerica’s assets and determination of the level of comerica’s allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

in particular congress and other regulators have recently increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry 

on may 20 2009 the helping families save their homes act of 2009 which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the fdic to 250000 per depositor through december 31 2013 was signed into law this extension of the temporary 250000 coverage limit pursuant to the eesa became effective immediately upon the president’s signature 

during the second quarter of 2009 the fdic levied an industrywide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agency’s efforts to rebuild dif in november 2009 the fdic amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 20102012 the prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first the fdic is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the riskbased assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter thus we may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 

comerica’s participation in the tagp required the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic through june 30 2010 in addition to the fdic’s regular and special assessments additionally in july 2010 the financial reform act reinstated for all financial institutions unlimited deposit insurance on noninterestbearing accounts for the period from december 31 2010 through december 31 2012 

in november 2009 the federal reserve adopted amendments to its regulation e that were effective on july 1 2010 the changes affect the circumstances when comerica is able to charge its clients overdraft fees 

on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee the “financial crisis responsibility fee” on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system if implemented as initially proposed the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica on february 14 2011 the administration included a revised financial crisis responsibility fee in its proposed fiscal 2012 budget 

on july 21 2010 the financial reform act was signed into law the financial reform act implements a variety of farreaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the 1930s many of the provisions of the financial reform act will directly affect comerica’s ability to conduct its business including but not limited to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 many provisions in the financial reform act remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and implementation the effects of which are not yet known 

in december 2009 the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee released proposed basel iii guidance on bank capital and liquidity in september 2010 the basel committee proposed higher global minimum capital standards including a minimum tier 1 common capital ratio and additional capital and liquidity requirements with rules expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019 adoption in the us is expected to occur over a similar timeframe but the final form of the us rules is uncertain 

the effects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be determined at this time moreover as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown any delay in the economic recovery or a worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect comerica we can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comerica’s businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

 

 although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comerica’s financial results 

 

 on january 16 2011 comerica and sterling entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of sterling by comerica the proposed acquisition presents the following risks among others 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 as discussed above the financial reform act creates a financial stability oversight council that may recommend to the federal reserve increasingly strict rules for capital requirements as companies grow in size and complexity and applies the same leverage and riskbased capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies which among other things will after a threeyear phasein period which begins january 1 2013 remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company’s tier 1 capital these requirements and any other new regulations could adversely affect comerica’s ability to pay dividends or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition 

in addition on september 12 2010 the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee on banking supervision announced agreement on the calibration and phasein arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements known as basel iii when fully phased in basel iii will introduce a minimum tier 1 common equity ratio to 45 net of regulatory deductions and establish a capital conservation buffer of an additional 25 of common equity to riskweighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital requirement establishing a minimum common equity ratio plus capital conservation buffer at 7 this capital conservation buffer will impose capital distribution constraints when the tier 1 capital ratio falls under 85 and the total capital ratio falls under 105 in addition basel iii introduces a countercyclical capital buffer of up to 25 of common equity or other loss absorbing capital above the regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer for periods of excess credit growth basel iii also introduces a nonrisk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards the basel iii capital and liquidity standards will be phased in over a period of several years the text of the final basel iii capital and liquidity rules was published on december 16 2010 and is now subject to individual adoption by member nations including the united states 

banking regulators could implement changes to the capital adequacy standards applicable to comerica and comerica bank in light of basel iii the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators 

 

 problems in the united states’ residential real estate development industry specifically in michigan midwest market and both northern and southern california western market have materially and adversely impacted comerica in recent periods recent economic conditions have resulted in decreased demand for residential housing which in turn has adversely affected the development and construction 

  

efforts of residential real estate developers consequently the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans has been adversely affected these problems facing residential real estate developers have had and the continuation or worsening of such problems may have a material and adverse impact on the financial results of comerica 

 

 comerica’s business customer base consists in part of lending concentrations in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive production industry and the real estate business recent economic conditions have significantly impacted such businesses which has adversely affected comerica in the event of further decline in any one of those customers’ businesses or industries comerica could experience increased credit losses and its business could be materially adversely affected 

 

 comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

 

 the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comerica’s future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands and create additional efficiencies in comerica’s operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

 comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica in addition there is the risk that comerica’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such occurrences or failures could materially and adversely affect comerica’s business and operations by exposing it to potential liability to customers reputational damage and regulatory intervention 

  

 the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions’ net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comerica’s financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

 

 comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comerica’s control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comerica’s ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

current economic conditions have negatively affected consumer confidence levels a worsening of these conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comerica’s customers and others in the financial institutions industry 

 

 the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comerica’s earnings 

 

 comerica’s future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comerica’s future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel 

  

competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel comerica’s ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comerica’s inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

on february 7 2011 the board of directors of the fdic approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement section 956 of the financial reform act although the fdic board acted on the proposal on february 7 2011 the proposal is a joint rule making by the five federal members of the federal financial institutions examination council fdic frs occ office of thrift supervision and national credit union administration the securities and exchange commission and the federal housing finance agency who must each independently approve the proposed rule before it is published in the federal register for comment section 956 prohibits incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses consistent with the financial reform act the proposed rule does not apply to banks with total consolidated assets of less than 1 billion and contains heightened standards for institutions with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the rule requires that at least 50 percent of incentivebased payments be deferred for a minimum of three years for designated executives moreover boards of directors of these larger institutions must identify employees who individually have the ability to expose the institution to substantial risk and must determine that the incentive compensation for these employees appropriately balances risk and rewards according to enumerated standards 

 

 comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comerica’s efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comerica’s financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comerica’s regulators that could materially adversely affect comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market and liquidity operational compliance business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s business financial condition or results of operations 

 

 terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comerica’s operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comerica’s operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm 

  

comerica’s stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comerica’s operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comerica’s common stock 

 

 comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods these types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy comerica’s business and customers and have posed physical risks to comerica’s property a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect comerica’s operating results

 item 2 properties 

the executive offices of comerica are located in the comerica bank tower 1717 main street dallas texas 75201 comerica bank leases five floors of the building plus an additional 34238 square feet on the building’s lower level from an unaffiliated third party the lease for such space used by comerica and its subsidiaries extends through september 2023 comerica and its subsidiaries also currently lease 11 floors in the comerica tower at one detroit center 500 woodward avenue detroit michigan 48226 such space is leased through comerica bank from an unaffiliated third party the leases at that building extend through january 2012 comerica is renovating its owned building at 411 w lafayette detroit michigan as its new michigan headquarters and the majority of its employees at comerica tower will be relocated to that building as of december 31 2010 comerica through its banking affiliates operated a total of 511 banking centers trust services locations and loan production or other financial services offices primarily in the states of texas michigan california florida and arizona of these offices 222 were owned and 289 were leased as of december 31 2010 affiliates also operated from leased spaces in denver colorado wilmington delaware oakbrook terrace illinois boston and waltham massachusetts minneapolis minnesota princeton and sea girt new jersey las vegas nevada new york new york rocky mount and cary north carolina granville ohio memphis tennessee reston virginia bellevue and seattle washington monterrey mexico toronto ontario canada and windsor ontario canada comerica and its subsidiaries own among other properties a check processing center in livonia michigan a 10story building in the central business district of detroit michigan that houses certain departments of comerica and comerica bank and three buildings in auburn hills michigan used mainly for lending functions and operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

comerica and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations comerica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and with respect to such legal proceedings intends to continue to defend itself vigorously litigating or settling cases according to management’s judgment as to what is in the best interests of comerica and its shareholders on at least a quarterly basis comerica assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available on a casebycase basis reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts 

  

reserved based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management believes that current reserves are adequate and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on comerica’s consolidated financial condition 

the damages alleged by plaintiffs or claimants may be overstated unsubstantiated by legal theory unsupported by the facts andor bear no relation to the ultimate award that a court jury or agency might impose in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters comerica cannot state with confidence a range of reasonably possible losses nor what the eventual outcome of these matters will be however based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel management believes the maximum amount of reasonably possible losses would not have a material adverse effect on comerica’s consolidated financial condition

activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company

the interstate act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branches in other states thereby creating interstate branching provided that in the case of purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations such state must have optedin to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases or de novo branching and in the case of mergers such state must not have optedout of that portion of the interstate act 

as permitted by the interstate act comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas michigan california florida and arizona 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in 

any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

at january 1 2010 comericas subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 56 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the retained net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2010 through the date of declaration comerica has sufficient liquid assets at december 31 2009 to fulfill its 2010 dividend payment objectives without reliance on dividends from banking subsidiaries comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of 59 million in 2009 267 million in 2008 and 614 million in 2007 without the need for prior governmental approvals in addition as a participant in the capital purchase program effective november 14 2008 comerica cannot increase its quarterly dividend above 033 per common share the quarterly dividend rate in effect as of november 14 2008 for a discussion of the capital purchase program please refer to pages 8 and 9 of this annual report on form 10k 

source of strength 

frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2009 comerica and its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending truth in savings provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into two tiers core tier 1 capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary tier 2 capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions bank holding companies that engage in trading activities whose trading activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain capital for market risk market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account foreign exchange and commodity positions whether resulting from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates or commodity prices or from position specific factors 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and total capital the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2009 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1246 and 1693 of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comericas leverage ratio of 1325 at december 31 2009 reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdic insurance assessments 

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the deposit insurance fund dif additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008 comerica and its subsidiary banks elected to participate in the fdics transaction account guarantee program that requires the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic during the fourth quarter of 2009 comerica further elected to continue its participation in the fdics transaction account guarantee program through june 30 2010 

as of december 31 2009 comericas banking subsidiaries held approximately 389 billion of difassessable deposits prior to 2007 comericas banking subsidiaries had not paid nor been assessed deposit insurance assessments on difassessable deposits under the fdics risk related assessment system the fdics risk related assessment system was revised effective january 1 2007 however and comericas banking subsidiaries were assessed deposit insurance premiums on a quarterly basis beginning in june 2007 in 2008 these assessment premiums totaled 268 million and were first applied against the remaining credit of 171 million during the second quarter of 2009 the fdic levied an industrywide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agencys efforts to rebuild dif in november 2009 the fdic amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 20102012 the prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first comerica paid such prepaid assessment on december 30 2009 along with its regular quarterly riskbased deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of 2009 in 2009 these assessment premiums totaled 281 million including the second quarter special assessment of 29 million and prepaid assessments of 200 million which includes assessments that will be expensed by comerica during 20102012 

in addition on january 12 2010 the fdic announced that it would seek public comment on whether financial institutions with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such financial institutions would otherwise be charged 

the fdic is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the riskbased assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter thus comerica may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties

future legislation 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways moreover in light of recent events and current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have continued to increase their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 comerica and its subsidiaries had 8939 fulltime and 781 parttime employees

similar expressions as they relate to comerica or its management are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

comerica cautions that forwardlooking statements are subject to numerous assumptions risks and uncertainties which change over time forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statement is made and comerica does not undertake to update forwardlooking statements to reflect facts circumstances assumptions or events that occur after the date the forwardlooking statements are made actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

• general political economic or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may be less favorable than expected local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy costs and fuel prices outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comericas earnings 

• governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry and therefore impact comericas financial condition and results of operations monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve board affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

• volatility and disruptions in the functioning of the financial markets and related liquidity issues could continue or worsen and therefore may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations the financial markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption in recent periods the impact of this situation together with concerns regarding the financial strength of financial institutions has led to distress in financial markets and issues relating to liquidity among financial institutions as a result of concern about the stability of the financial markets generally the resulting credit availability issues lack of confidence in the financial sector increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could have a material adverse effect on comericas ability to access capital and manage liquidity if current levels of financial market volatility and disruption continue or worsen there can be no assurance that comericas business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially and adversely impacted 

• changes in the performance and creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations current market developments and economic conditions have affected consumer confidence levels which may result in adverse changes in payment patterns of comericas customers this market turmoil and the tightening of credit have led to an increased level of consumer and commercial delinquencies lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally a worsening of these conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry increased delinquencies and default rates may impact comericas loan chargeoffs and related provisioning for loan losses deterioration in the quality of its credit portfolio could have an adverse impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

• the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

• recently enacted legislation actions recently taken by or proposed by the united states department of treasury the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal reserve bank or other governmental entities and legislation enacted in the future subject comerica to increased regulation and the impact and expiration of such legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect comerica on october 3 2008 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 the eesa was signed into law pursuant to the eesa the us treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets and has proposed several programs including the purchase by the us treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions and the direct purchase by the us treasury of equity of financial institutions pursuant to the eesa the us treasury has the authority to among other things purchase up to 700 billion of mortgages mortgagebacked securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets in connection therewith the us treasury introduced the capital purchase program under which it has purchased approximately 196 billion of preferred stock in eligible institutions including comerica to increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and to support the us economy the eesa also temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the fdic from 100000 to 250000 per depositor 

on may 20 2009 the helping families save their homes act of 2009 which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the fdic to 250000 per depositor through december 31 2013 was signed into law this extension of the temporary 250000 coverage limit pursuant to the eesa became effective immediately upon the 

presidents signature the legislation provides that the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the fdic will return to 100000 on january 1 2014 

on october 14 2008 the fdic announced the development of a guarantee program under the systemic risk exception to the federal deposit act as a result of this regulatory initiative the fdic implemented the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system the tlgp is comprised of the debt guarantee program dgp and the transaction account guarantee program tagp the dgp guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt eg promissory notes unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on october 14 2008 and continued through october 31 2009 for eligible debt issued by that date the fdic will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or december 31 2012 or june 30 2012 for debt issued prior to april 1 2009 the tagp offers full guarantee for noninterestbearing transaction accounts held at fdicinsured depository institutions the unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to the 250000 fdic deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the eesa and the helping families save their homes act respectively the limits are presently scheduled to return to 100000 on january 1 2014 the tagp coverage became effective on october 14 2008 and will continue for comerica and participating institutions until june 30 2010 

during the second quarter of 2009 the fdic levied an industrywide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agencys efforts to rebuild dif in november 2009 the fdic amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly riskbased assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 20102012 the prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments as they may be so revised until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned whichever occurs first the fdic is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the riskbased assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter thus we may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 

the programs and regulations established or to be established under the eesa and capital purchase program may have adverse effects upon comerica it may face increased regulation of the financial services industry compliance with such regulation may increase comericas costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities also participation in specific programs may subject comerica to additional restrictions for example comericas participation in the capital purchase program limits without the consent of the us treasury its ability to a increase its quarterly dividend above 033 per common share the quarterly dividend rate in effect as of november 14 2008 or b repurchase any of its shares with limited exceptions most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans comerica also issued a warrant to purchase 11479592 million of its common shares at an exercise price of 2940 per share these restrictions as well as the potential dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of its common stock comericas participation in the tagp will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic in addition to the fdics regular and special assessments the affects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on comerica cannot reliably be determined at this time moreover as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown any delay in the economic recovery or a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect comerica 

recently the federal reserve adopted amendments to its regulation e that will be effective on july 1 2010 the changes will affect the circumstances when comerica will be able to charge its clients overdraft fees 

on january 14 2010 the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee the financial crisis responsibility fee on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the us government to stabilize the financial system if implemented as initially proposed the financial crisis responsibility fee will be applied to firms with over 50 billion in consolidated assets and therefore by its terms would apply to comerica the financial crisis responsibility fee if implemented as proposed by the current administration would go into effect on june 30 2010 and remain in place for at least ten years 

in addition there have been a number of recent legislative and regulatory proposals that could have an impact on the operations of comerica and its subsidiaries we can neither predict when or whether regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on comericas businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time and such impact may adversely affect comerica 

• unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect comericas financial results although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

• problems faced by residential real estate developers could adversely impact comerica problems in the united states residential real estate development industry specifically in michigan midwest market and both northern and southern california western market have materially and adversely impacted comerica in recent periods poor economic conditions have resulted in decreased demand for residential housing which in turn has adversely affected the development and construction efforts of residential real estate developers consequently the current economic downturn has adversely affected the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans these problems facing residential real estate developers have had and the continuation or worsening of such problems may have a material and adverse impact on the financial results of comerica 

• businesses or industries in which comerica has lending concentrations including but not limited to automotive production industry and the real estate business could suffer a significant decline which could adversely affect comerica comericas business customer base consists in part of lending concentrations in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive production industry and the real estate business recent economic conditions have significantly impacted such businesses which has adversely affected comerica in the event of a continued or worsening downturn in the economy or further decline in any one of those customers businesses or industries comerica could experience increased credit losses and its business could be materially adversely affected 

• the introduction implementation withdrawal success and timing of business initiatives and strategies including but not limited to the opening of new banking centers may be less successful or may be different than anticipated which could adversely affect comericas business comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product 

needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

• utilization of technology to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

• operational difficulties or information security problems could adversely affect comericas business and operations comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica in addition there is the risk that comericas controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such occurrences or failures could materially and adversely affect comericas business and operations by exposing it to potential liability to customers reputational damage and regulatory intervention 

• changes in the financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect comericas net interest income and balance sheet the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

• competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within comericas markets may change comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices generally may be different than anticipated comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

• managements ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

• managements ability to retain key officers and employees may change comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the arra was signed into law section 7001 of the arra amended section 111 of the eesa in its entirety on june 10 2009 the us treasury released an interim final rule the ifr effective june 15 2009 that provided guidance on the compensation and governance standards for troubled asset relief program tarp recipients and promulgated regulations to implement the restrictions and standards set forth in section 7001 of the arra among other things the ifr and arra significantly expanded the executive compensation restrictions previously imposed by the eesa such restrictions apply to any entity that has received or will receive financial assistance under the tarp and shall generally continue to apply for as long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under tarp including preferred stock issued under the capital purchase program remains outstanding these arra restrictions shall not apply to any tarp recipient during such time when the federal government i only holds any warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient or ii does not hold any preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient as a result of our participation in the capital purchase program the restrictions and standards set forth in section 7001 of the arra as well as the ifr promulgated by the us treasury shall be applicable to comerica such restrictions and standards may further impact managements ability to compete with financial institutions that are not subject to the same limitations as comerica under section 7001 of the arra and the ifr 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

• legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry including those directly involving comerica and its subsidiaries could adversely affect comerica or the financial services industry in general comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the texas department of banking the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system the securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses in light of the current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market and liquidity operational compliance business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• terrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and comerica terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

• natural disasters including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires and floods may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and comerica comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods these types of natural disasters at times have disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property a significant natural disaster could materially adversely affect comericas operating results

source of strength 

frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions 

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2008 comerica and its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending truth in savings provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institutions or holding companys assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institutions or holding companys capital in turn is divided into two tiers core tier 1 capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary tier 2 capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and total capital the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2008 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 1066 and 1472 of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comericas leverage ratio of 1177 at december 31 2008 reflects the nature of comericas balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdic insurance assessments 

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the deposit insurance fund dif additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008 comerica and its subsidiary banks elected to participate in the fdics transaction account guarantee program that requires the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic as of december 31 2008 comericas banking subsidiaries held approximately 417 billion of difassessable deposits prior to 2007 comericas banking subsidiaries had not paid nor been assessed deposit insurance assessments on the difassessable deposits under the fdics risk related assessment system the fdics risk related assessment system was revised effective january 1 2007 however and comericas banking subsidiaries were assessed deposit insurance premiums on a quarterly basis beginning in june 2007 in 2008 these assessment premiums totaled 268 million and were first applied against the remaining credit of 171 million we may also be required to pay significantly higher fdic insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments have significantly depleted dif and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

recent regulatory developments

future legislation 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways moreover in light of the current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry comerica cannot accurately predict whether legislative changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica

in addition to factors mentioned elsewhere in this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom  the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance 

• general political economic or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may be less favorable than expected local domestic and international economic political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly conditions such as or related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates tight money supply international conflicts and other factors such as real estate values energy costs and fuel prices outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica as has been the case with impact of recent economic conditions economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans which could have a material adverse impact on comericas earnings 

• governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry and therefore impact comericas financial condition and results of operations monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve board affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the federal 

reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its monetary and fiscal policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies 

• volatility and disruptions in the functioning of the financial markets and related liquidity issues could continue or worsen and therefore may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations the financial markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption in recent periods the impact of this situation together with concerns regarding the financial strength of financial institutions has led to distress in financial markets and issues relating to liquidity among financial institutions as a result of concern about the stability of the financial markets generally the resulting credit availability issues lack of confidence in the financial sector increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could have a material adverse effect on comericas ability to access capital and manage liquidity if current levels of financial market volatility and disruption continue or worsen there can be no assurance that comericas business financial condition and results of operations will not be materially and adversely impacted 

• changes in the performance and creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations current market developments and economic conditions have affected consumer confidence levels which may result in adverse changes in payment patterns of comericas customers this market turmoil and the tightening of credit have led to an increased level of consumer and commercial delinquencies lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally a worsening of these conditions would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry increased delinquencies and default rates may impact comericas loan chargeoffs and related provisioning for loan losses deterioration in the quality of its credit portfolio could have an adverse impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations 

• the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possible materially in nature comerica 

• there can be no assurances that recently enacted legislation such as the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 and actions taken by the united states department of treasury and the federal deposit insurance corporation for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve their intended effects and the impact of such legislation and regulatory programs on comerica cannot reliably be determined at this time on october 3 2008 the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 the eesa was signed into law pursuant to the eesa the us treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets and has proposed several programs including the purchase by the us treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions and the direct purchase by the us treasury of equity of financial institutions pursuant to the eesa the us treasury has the authority to among other things purchase up to 700 billion of mortgages mortgagebacked securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets in connection therewith the us treasury introduced the capital purchase program under which it has purchased approximately 196 billion of preferred stock in eligible institutions including comerica to increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and to support the us economy the eesa also temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the fdic from 100000 to 250000 per depositor 

on october 14 2008 the fdic announced the development of a guarantee program under the systemic risk exception to the federal deposit act as a result of this regulatory initiative the fdic implemented the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system the tlgp is comprised of the debt guarantee program dgp and the transaction account guarantee program tagp the dgp guarantees all newly issued senior unsecured debt eg promissory notes unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on october 14 2008 and continuing through june 30 2009 for eligible debt issued by that date the fdic will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or june 30 2012 the tagp offers full guarantee for noninterestbearing transaction accounts held at fdicinsured depository institutions the unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to the 250000 fdic deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the eesa the limits are presently scheduled to return to 100000 on january 1 2010 the tagp coverage became effective on october 14 2008 and will continue for participating institutions until december 31 2009 

the programs established or to be established under the eesa and capital purchase program may have adverse effects upon comerica it may face increased regulation of the financial services industry compliance with such regulation may increase comericas costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities also participation in specific programs may subject comerica to additional restrictions for example comericas participation in the capital purchase program limits without the consent of the us treasury its ability to a increase its quarterly dividend above 033 per common share the quarterly dividend rate in effect as of november 14 2008 or b repurchase any of its shares with limited exceptions most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans comerica also issued a warrant to purchase 11479592 million of its common shares at an exercise price of 2940 per share these restrictions as well as the potential dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of its common stock similarly the fdics tlgp programs the dgp and the tagp may have an adverse effect on comerica comericas participation in the tagp will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic the affects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory programs on comerica cannot reliably be determined at this time 

• unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect comericas financial results although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results 

• problems faced by residential real estate developers could adversely impact comerica problems in the united states residential real estate development industry specifically in michigan midwest market and both northern and southern california western market have materially and adversely impacted comerica in recent periods poor economic conditions have resulted in decreased demand for residential housing which in turn has adversely affected the development and construction efforts of residential real estate developers consequently the current economic downturn has adversely affected the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans these problems facing residential real estate developers have had and the continuation or worsening of such problems may have a material and adverse impact on the financial results of comerica 

• businesses or industries in which comerica has lending concentrations including but not limited to automotive production industry and the real estate business could suffer a significant decline which could adversely affect comerica comericas business customer base consists in part of lending concentrations in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive production industry and the real estate business recent economic conditions have significantly impacted such businesses which has adversely affected comerica in the event of a continued or worsening downturn in the economy or further decline in any one of those customers businesses or industries comerica could experience increased credit losses and its business could be materially adversely affected 

• the introduction implementation withdrawal success and timing of business initiatives and strategies including but not limited to the opening of new banking centers may be less successful or may be different than anticipated which could adversely affect comericas business comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business 

• utilization of technology to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations 

• operational difficulties or information security problems could adversely affect comericas business and operations comerica is exposed to many types of operational risk including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions comerica may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which may include for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica in addition there is the risk that comericas controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate any such occurrences or failures could materially and adversely affect comericas business and operations by exposing it to potential liability to customers reputational damage and regulatory intervention 

• changes in the financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect comericas net interest income and balance sheet the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions 

• competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within comericas markets may change comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices generally may be different than anticipated comerica uses a variety of financial tools models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements 

• managements ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings 

• managements ability to retain key officers and employees may change comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time 

comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the arra was signed into law section 7001 of the arra amended section 111 of the eesa in its entirety while the us treasury must promulgate regulations to implement the restrictions and standards set forth in section 7001 the arra among other things significantly expands the executive compensation restrictions previously imposed by the eesa such restrictions apply to any entity that has received or will receive financial assistance under the troubled asset recovery program and shall generally continue to apply for as long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under tarp including preferred stock issued under the capital purchase program remains outstanding these arra restrictions shall not apply to any troubled asset recovery program recipient during such time when the federal government i only holds any warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient or ii does not hold any preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock of such recipient as a result of our participation in the capital purchase program the restrictions and standards set forth in section 7001 of the arra shall be applicable to comerica subject to regulations promulgated by the us treasury such restrictions and standards may further impact managements ability to compete with financial institutions that are not subject to the same limitations as comerica under section 7001 of the arra 

comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees 

• legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry including those directly involving comerica and its subsidiaries could adversely affect comerica or the financial services industry in general comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such 

matters could result in actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the texas department of banking the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system the securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses in light of the current conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market and liquidity operational compliance business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations 

• terrorist activities or other hostilities may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and comerica terrorist attacks or other hostilities may disrupt comericas operations or those of its customers in addition these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular which could harm comericas operations any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm comericas stock price and may limit the capital resources available to comerica and its customers this could have a material adverse impact on comericas operating results revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of comericas common stock 

• natural disasters including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes fires and floods may adversely affect the general economy financial and capital markets specific industries and comerica comerica has significant operations and a significant customer base in california texas florida and other regions where natural disasters may occur these regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods these types of natural disasters at times have disrupted the local economy comericas business and customers and have posed physical risks to comericas property a significant natural disaster could materially adversely affect comericas operating results

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica’s banking subsidiaries compete primarily with banks based in its primary areas of operations in the united states for loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona california colorado delaware florida illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota north carolina nevada new jersey new york ohio tennessee texas virginia and washington comerica competes with other financial institutions for various deposits loans and other products and services 

based on the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “interstate act” and the grammleachbliley act as described below comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will increase in the future in addition to banks comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed 

comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking travel agent services and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of texas and at the state level is supervised and regulated by the texas department of banking comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are members of the federal reserve system “frs” and are supervised and regulated by the federal reserve bank of dallas and the federal reserve bank of chicago respectively the deposits of both the foregoing banks are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the financial industry regulatory authority in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica capital markets corporation the office of financial and insurance services department of insurance of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission in the case of comerica securities inc comerica capital markets corporation and world asset management inc 

in most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval however is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a financial or bank holding company or a bank comerica’s current rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” is “outstanding” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities in addition comerica is “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and regulation w of the frb limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and its affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on armslength terms 

set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its domestic banks and other subsidiaries the summaries are not complete are qualified in their entirety by references to the particular statutes and regulations and are not intended as legal advice a change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of comerica 

interstate banking and branching 

pursuant to the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 

the interstate act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branches in other states thereby creating interstate branching provided that in the case of purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations such state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases or de novo branching and in the case of mergers such state must not have “optedout” of that portion of the interstate act 

as permitted by the interstate act comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in texas michigan california florida and arizona 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such bank’s retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

at january 1 2008 comerica’s subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 234 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the retained net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2008 through the date of declaration comerica’s subsidiary banks declared dividends of 614 million in 2007 746 million in 2006 and 793 million in 2005 without the need for prior governmental approvals 

source of strength 

frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions 

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2007 comerica and its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2007 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 751 and 1120 of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comerica’s leverage ratio of 926 at december 31 2007 reflects the nature of comerica’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdic insurance assessments 

comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the deposit insurance fund “dif” as of december 31 2007 comerica’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 430 billion of difassessable deposits prior to 2007 comerica’s banking subsidiaries had not paid nor been assessed deposit insurance assessments on the difassessable deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system the fdic’s risk related assessment system was revised effective january 1 2007 however and comerica’s banking subsidiaries were assessed deposit insurance premiums on a quarterly basis beginning in june 2007 in 2007 these assessment premiums totaled 163 million and were applied against a onetime credit of 334 million comerica expects to apply the remaining credit of 171 million against assessment premiums in 2008 before making payments in 2008 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

future legislation 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

employees

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica’s banking subsidiaries compete primarily with banks based in its primary areas of operations in the united states for loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona california colorado delaware florida illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota north carolina nevada new jersey new york ohio tennessee texas virginia and washington comerica competes with other financial institutions for various deposits loans and other products and services 

based on the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “interstate act” and the grammleachbliley act as described below comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will increase in the future in addition to banks comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed 

comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking travel agent services and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of michigan and at this level is primarily supervised and regulated by the division of financial institutions office of financial and insurance services of the michigan department of labor and economic growth comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are members of the federal reserve system “frs” the deposits of both the foregoing banks are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica incorporated in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the national association of securities dealers inc in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica capital markets corporation the department of insurance of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica capital markets corporation 

in most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior frb approval however is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a financial or bank holding company or a bank comerica’s current rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 “cra” is “outstanding” if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the cra of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities in addition comerica is “well capitalized” and “well managed” under frb standards if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and regulation w of the frb limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and its affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on armslength terms 

set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its domestic banks and other subsidiaries the summaries are not complete are qualified in their entirety by references to the particular statutes and regulations and are not intended as legal advice a change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of comerica 

interstate banking and branching 

pursuant to the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 

the interstate act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branches in other states thereby creating interstate branching provided that in the case of purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations such state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law permitting such branch purchases or de novo branching and in the case of mergers such state must not have “optedout” of that portion of the interstate act 

as permitted by the interstate act comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in michigan california texas florida and arizona 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb or the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such bank’s retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and requiring prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

at january 1 2007 comerica’s subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 261 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the retained net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2007 through the date of declaration comerica’s subsidiary banks declared dividends of 746 million in 2006 793 million in 2005 and 691 million in 2004 without the need for prior governmental approvals 

source of strength 

frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions 

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 

at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2006 comerica and its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2006 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 802 and 1163 of its total riskweighted assets respectively 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comerica’s leverage ratio of 976 at december 31 2006 reflects the nature of comerica’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdic insurance assessments 

comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the deposit insurance fund “dif” as of december 31 2006 comerica’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 426 billion of difassessable deposits comerica’s banking subsidiaries in recent years have not paid nor been assessed deposit insurance assessments on the difassessable deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system the fdic’s risk related system has been revised effective in 2007 however and comerica’s banking subsidiaries will be expected to begin paying annual deposit insurance assessments annually although comerica’s banking subsidiaries have approximately 34 million of credits to use before assessments will be expensed and paid 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

future legislation 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

employees

competition 

the financial services business is highly competitive comerica’s banking subsidiaries compete primarily with banks based in its primary areas of operations in the united states for loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona california colorado delaware florida illinois massachusetts michigan minnesota north carolina nevada new jersey new york ohio tennessee texas virginia and washington comerica competes with other financial institutions for various deposits loans and other products and services 

based on the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “interstate act” and the grammleachbliley act as described below comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will increase in the future in addition to banks comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and 

loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms 

supervision and regulation 

banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended 

the grammleachbliley act expanded the activities in which a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company can engage the conditions to be a financial holding company include among others the requirement that each depository institution subsidiary of the holding company be well capitalized and well managed 

comerica became a financial holding company in 2000 as a financial holding company comerica may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are financial in nature activities that are “financial in nature” include but are not limited to securities underwriting securities dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking travel agent services and activities that the frb has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity provided that it does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of the depository institution or the financial system generally a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company is limited to engaging in banking and other activities previously determined by the frb to be closely related to banking 

comerica bank is chartered by the state of michigan and at this level is primarily supervised and regulated by the division of financial institutions office of financial and insurance services of the michigan department of labor and economic growth comerica bank  trust national association is chartered under federal law and subject to supervision and regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are members of the federal reserve system “frs” the deposits of both the foregoing banks are insured by the bank insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” to the extent provided by law comerica bank mexico sa is chartered under the laws of mexico and is supervised and regulated by the ministry of finance and public credit the bank of mexico and the mexican national banking commission 

the frb supervises nonbanking activities conducted by companies directly and indirectly owned by comerica incorporated in addition comerica’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various state federal and selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to the national association of securities dealers inc in the case of comerica securities inc and comerica capital markets corporation the department of insurance of the state of michigan in the case of comerica insurance services inc and the securities and exchange commission in the case of comerica securities inc comerica capital markets corporation and munder capital management 

in most cases no frb approval is required for comerica to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the 

frb prior frb approval however is required before comerica may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5 of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company or bank if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 of less than “satisfactory” comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on comerica’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of comerica or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company 

various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and regulation w of the frb limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and its affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on armslength terms 

set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its domestic banks and other subsidiaries the summaries are not complete are qualified in their entirety by references to the particular statutes and regulations and are not intended as legal advice a change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of comerica 

interstate banking and branching 

pursuant to the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the “interstate act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 

the interstate act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branches in other states thereby creating interstate branching provided that in the case of purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations such state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law 

permitting such branch purchases or de novo branching and in the case of mergers such state must not have “optedout” of that portion of the interstate act 

as permitted by the interstate act comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in michigan california texas florida and arizona 

dividends 

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below 

comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb or the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such bank’s retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound business practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and require prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels 

at january 1 2006 comerica’s subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 240 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the retained net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2006 through the date of declaration comerica’s subsidiary banks declared dividends of 793 million in 2005 691 million in 2004 and 354 million in 2003 without the need for prior governmental approvals 

source of strength 

frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions 

fdicia 

the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other 

things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure 

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 

as of december 31 2005 comerica and its us banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations 

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to 

customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic 

capital requirements 

comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ 

for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions 

comerica like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2005 comerica met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 846 and 1175 of its total riskweighted assets 

comerica is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb comerica’s leverage ratio of 999 at december 31 2005 reflects the nature of comerica’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy 

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 

fdic insurance assessments 

comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the bank insurance fund “bif” and the savings insurance fund the “saif” as of december 31 2005 comerica’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 399 billion and 10 billion respectively of bif and saifassessable deposits comerica currently pays no deposit insurance assessments on the bif or saifassessable deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system but paid the fdic 56 million in the year ended december 31 2005 on the bif and saifassessable deposits under a separate assessment program 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies 

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties 

future legislation 

changes to the laws of the states and countries in which comerica and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of comerica 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 comerica and its subsidiaries had 10207 fulltime and 1136 parttime employees

the assets of a bank holding company or bank if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to receive a rating under the community reinvestment act of 1977 of less than satisfactory comerica would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities if any subsidiary bank of comerica were to cease being “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on the corporation’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the corporation or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order comerica to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies or comerica could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company various governmental requirements including sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and regulation w of the frb limit borrowings by comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries from its affiliate insured depository institutions and also limit various other transactions between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and its affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section 23a of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s loans and other “covered transactions” with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10 of the institution’s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution’s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20 of its total capital section 23a of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institution’s loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum 100 secured and section 23b of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institution’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on armslength terms set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to comerica and its domestic banks and other subsidiaries the summaries are not complete are qualified in their entirety by references to the particular statutes and regulations and are not intended as legal advice a change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of comerica interstate banking and branching pursuant to the interstate act a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than 10 of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than 30 of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than 30 the interstate act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branches in other states thereby creating interstate branching provided that in the case of purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations such state must have “optedin” to the interstate act by enacting a law 5 

permitting such branch purchases or de novo branching and in the case of mergers such state must not have “optedout” of that portion of the interstate act as permitted by the interstate act comerica has consolidated most of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with branches in michigan california texas florida and arizona dividends comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below comerica bank and comerica bank  trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb or the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such bank’s retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound business practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and require prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels at january 1 2005 comerica’s subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 470 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the retained net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2005 through the date of declaration comerica’s subsidiary banks declared dividends of 691 million in 2004 354 million in 2003 and 647 million in 2002 without the need for prior governmental approvals source of strength frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions 6 

fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 and a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 and in some cases 3 under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category as of december 31 2004 the corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors or stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate 7 

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic comerica’s subsidiary banks are all wellcapitalized and may accept brokered deposits as permitted by their charters capital requirements comerica and its bank subsidiaries are subject to riskbased capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the frb andor the occ for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions the corporation like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2004 the corporation met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 877 and 1275 of its total riskweighted assets the corporation is also required to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 to 5 depending upon criteria defined and assessed by the frb the corporation’s leverage ratio of 1037 at december 31 2004 reflects the nature of the corporation’s balance sheet and demonstrates a commitment to capital adequacy as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures  eg  credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 8 

fdic insurance assessments comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the bank insurance fund “bif” and the savings insurance fund the “saif” as of december 31 2004 the corporation’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 384 billion and 10 billion respectively of bif and saifassessable deposits the corporation currently pays no deposit insurance assessments on the bif or saifassessable deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system but paid the fdic 62 million in the year ended december 31 2004 on the bif and saifassessable deposits under a separate assessment program enforcement powers of federal banking agencies the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil penalties future legislation changes to the laws of the states and countries in which the corporation and its subsidiaries do business could affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation employees as of december 31 2004 comerica and its subsidiaries had 10275 fulltime and 1239 parttime employees available information the corporation maintains an internet website at wwwcomericacom where the annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports are available without charge as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are filed with or furnished to the us securities and exchange commission the code of business conduct and ethics and the senior financial officer code of ethics adopted by the corporation are also available on the internet website and are available in print to any shareholder who requests them such requests should be made in writing to the corporate secretary at comerica incorporated comerica tower at detroit center 500 woodward avenue mc 3381 detroit michigan 48226 9

under state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and require prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels at january 1 2004 comerica’s subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 209 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2004 through the date of declaration comerica’s subsidiary banks declared dividends of 354 million in 2003 647 million in 2002 and 578 million in 2001 without the need for prior governmental approvals source of strength frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 percent a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 percent and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 percent and in some cases 3 percent under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category as of december 31 2003 the 6 

corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” under these regulations fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic comerica’s subsidiary banks are all wellcapitalized and may accept brokered deposits as permitted by their charters capital requirements the frb imposes on comerica and other banks riskbased capital requirements and guidelines which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions under their jurisdictions 7 

for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified offbalance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions the corporation like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital’ the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total riskweighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2003 the corporation met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 872 and 1271 of its total riskweighted assets the frb fdic and occ rules require comerica to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into their riskbased capital standards under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities the frb also requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 if the holding company has the highest regulatory rating and meets certain other requirements or of 3 plus an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points if the holding company does not meet these requirements at december 31 2003 the corporation’s leverage ratio was 1013 as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions they supervise the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards fdic insurance assessments comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the bank insurance fund the “bif” and the savings insurance fund the “saif” as of december 31 2003 the corporation’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 386 billion and 10 billion respectively of bif and saif assessable deposits the corporation currently pays no deposit insurance assessments on these deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system 8 

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil penalties future legislation changes to the laws of the states and countries in which the corporation and its subsidiaries do business can affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation competition financial service provision is a highly competitive business the corporation’s banking subsidiaries compete primarily with banks based in its primary areas of operations in the united states for loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona colorado georgia illinois indiana louisiana massachusetts minnesota north carolina new jersey nevada new york ohio oregon pennsylvania tennessee virginia and washington comerica competes with other financial institutions for various deposits loans and other products and services at yearend 2003 comerica was the largest financial holding company headquartered in michigan in terms of total assets and deposits based on the interstate act as described above and the grammleach bliley act comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will increase in the future comerica’s banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing companies credit unions banks insurance companies and securities firms employees as of december 31 2003 comerica and its subsidiaries had 10627 fulltime and 1227 parttime employees 9

in their entirety by references to the particular statutes and regulations and are not intended as legal advise that should be relied upon for any reason a change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the business of comerica interstate banking and branching pursuant to the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 the “interstate act” a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than ten percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states and no more than thirty percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than thirty percent the interstate act also authorizes banks to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branches in other states thereby creating interstate branching provided that in the case of purchasing branches and establishing new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations in such state such state must have “optedin” to the act by enacting a law permitting such de novo branching and in the case of mergers such state must not have “opted out” of that portion of the act since the provision permitting interstate bank acquisitions became effective comerica has had enhanced opportunities to acquire banks in any state subject to approval by the appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies under the interstate act comerica has the opportunity to consolidate its affiliate banks to create one bank with branches in more than one state or to establish branches in different states subject to any state “optin” and “optout” provisions dividends comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries most of comerica’s revenues result from dividends its bank subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below each state bank subsidiary that is a member of the frs and each national banking association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb or the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such bank’s retained net income as 6 defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound business practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends if such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comerica’s state bank subsidiaries are also subject to limitations under state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and require prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels at january 1 2003 comerica’s subsidiary banks without obtaining prior governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 101 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount approximately equal to the net profits as measured under current regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2003 through the date of declaration comerica’s subsidiary banks paid dividends of 647 million in 2002 578 million in 2001 and 339 million in 2000 source of strength according to federal reserve board policy bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the default of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of default the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdic’s loss subject to certain exceptions fdicia the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act “fdicia” requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized” a depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 10 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 6 percent a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and not be subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least 8 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 percent and a tier 1 7 leverage ratio of at least 4 percent and in some cases 3 percent under certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category as of december 31 2002 each of the banking subsidiaries of comerica were well capitalized under these regulations fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution may be required to do one or more of the following among other things sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or directors and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking agency shall determine appropriate fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending “truth in savings” provisions the requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic comerica’s united states subsidiary banks are all wellcapitalized and may accept brokered deposits 8 capital requirements the frb imposes on comerica riskbased capital requirements and guidelines which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the occ and the fdic on depository institutions under their jurisdictions for this purpose a depository institution’s or holding company’s assets and certain specified off balance sheet commitments are assigned to four risk categories each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital in turn is divided into two tiers core “tier 1” capital which includes common equity noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus excluding auction rate issues and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill certain identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and supplementary “tier 2” capital which includes among other items perpetual preferred stock not meeting the tier 1 definition mandatory convertible securities subordinated debt and allowances for loan and lease losses subject to certain limitations less certain required deductions the corporation like other bank holding companies currently is required to maintain tier 1 and “total capital” the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital equal to at least 4 and 8 of its total risk weighted assets including certain offbalancesheet items such as standby letters of credit respectively at december 31 2002 the corporation met both requirements with tier 1 and total capital equal to 805 and 1172 of its total riskweighted assets the frb fdic and occ rules require comerica to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into their riskbased capital standards under the market risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution’s ongoing trading activities the frb also requires bank holding companies to maintain a minimum “leverage ratio” tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets of 3 if the holding company has the highest regulatory rating and meets certain other requirements or of 3 plus an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points if the holding company does not meet these requirements at december 31 2002 the corporation’s leverage ratio was 929 as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions they supervise the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards fdic insurance assessments comerica’s subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the bank 9 insurance fund the “bif” and the savings insurance fund the “saif” as of december 31 2002 the corporation’s banking subsidiaries held approximately 397 billion and 11 billion respectively of bif and saif assessable deposits the corporation currently pays no deposit insurance assessments on these deposits under the fdic’s risk related assessment system but could be required to pay insurance assessments in 2003 enforcement powers of federal banking agencies the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil penalties future legislation changes to the laws of the states and countries in which the corporation and its subsidiaries do business can affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways comerica cannot accurately predict whether such changes will occur or if they occur the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation competition financial service provision is a highly competitive business the michigan banking subsidiary of the corporation

interstate banking and branching

pursuant to the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of
1994 the interstate act a bank holding company became able to acquire banks
in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of
such acquisition under state law but subject to any state requirement that the
bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to
exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to
and following the proposed acquisition control no more than ten percent of the
total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the united states
and no more than thirty percent of such deposits in that state or such amount
as established by state law

                                        5

page




the interstate act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby
creating interstate branching all of the states in which comericas banking
subsidiaries are located allow interstate branching furthermore under the
interstate act a bank is now able to open new branches in a state in which it
does not already have banking operations if such state enacts a law permitting
such de novo branching

since the provision permitting interstate bank acquisitions became effective
comerica has had enhanced opportunities to acquire banks in any state subject to
approval by the appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies under the
interstate act comerica has the opportunity to consolidate its affiliate banks
to create one bank with branches in more than one state or to establish
branches in different states subject to any state optin and optout
provisions

dividends

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other
subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank
subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable
to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by
comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are
discussed below

each state bank subsidiary that is a member of the frs and each national banking
association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb
or the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if
the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in
any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income
as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained
net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two
years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of
preferred stock further federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a banking
institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe and unsound business
practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends if such payment could be
deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition comericas state
bank subsidiaries are also subject to limitations under state law regarding the
amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends and require prior approval
for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels

at january 1 2002 comericas subsidiary banks without obtaining prior
governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately 641
million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an amount
approximately equal to the net profits as measured under current regulations
if any earned for the period from january 1 2002 through the date of
declaration comericas subsidiary banks paid dividends of 580 million in 2001
339 million in 2000 and 261 million in 1999

source of strength

according to federal reserve board policy bank holding companies are expected
to act as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources
to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a
bank holding company may not be able to provide such support similarly under
the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the
event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the
default of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided
to a subsidiary in danger of default the other banking subsidiaries may be
assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions

fdicia

fdicia substantially revised the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the
federal deposit insurance act and made revisions to several other federal
banking statutes among other things fdicia requires the federal banking
agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes
five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized
undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically
undercapitalized a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon
where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures
which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a
leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a
depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased
capital ratio of at least 10 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at
least 6 percent a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and not be
subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be
adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least
8 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 percent and a tier 1
leverage ratio of at least 4 percent and in some cases 3 percent under
certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well
capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the
institution were in the next lower capital category as of december 31 2001
each of the banking subsidiaries of comerica were well capitalized under these
regulations

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital
distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to
its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an
acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept
a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based
on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository
institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be
acceptable the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee
for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital
restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under
the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5

percent of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became
undercapitalized or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been
necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards
applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply
with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit or implement an
acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number
of requirements and restrictions specifically such a depository institution
may be required to do one or more of the following sell sufficient voting stock
to become adequately capitalized reduce the interest rates it pays on deposits
reduce its rate of asset growth dismiss certain senior executive officers or
directors and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks critically
undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or
conservator or such other action as the fdic and the applicable federal banking
agency shall determine appropriate

under fdicia the fdic is permitted to provide financial assistance to an
insured bank before appointment of a conservator or receiver only if i such
assistance would be the least costly method of meeting the fdics insurance
obligations ii grounds for appointment of a conservator or a receiver exist
or are likely to exist in the future iii it is unlikely that the bank can
meet all capital standards without assistance and iv the banks management has
been competent has complied with applicable laws regulations rules and
supervisory directives and has not engaged in any insider dealing speculative
practice or other abusive activity

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the
operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements
regulatory standards for real estate lending truth in savings provisions the
requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers
and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the
acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are
not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a
waiver from the fdic comericas united states subsidiary banks are all
wellcapitalized and may accept brokered deposits

capital requirements

the frb imposes on comerica riskbased capital requirements and guidelines
which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines
imposed by the frb the occ and the fdic on depository institutions under their
jurisdictions

the frb may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose
circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions
substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance
on intangible assets the frb also considers a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio
deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in
evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities


                                        8

page




the frb fdic and occ rules require comerica to incorporate market and interest
rate risk components into their riskbased capital standards under the market
risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk
related to a financial institutions ongoing trading activities

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of
depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to
establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions
for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally
to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and
executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against
institutions that fail to meet such standards

fdic insurance assessments

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments
the fdic operates a riskbased deposit premium assessment system under which
each depository institution is placed in one of nine assessment categories based
on certain capital and supervisory measures the deposit insurance assessment
schedule published by the fdic for the assessment period commencing january 1
1998 maintained the nine categories but provided for major reductions in the
assessment rates for institutions insured by bif these reductions occurred
because the balance in bif had reached or surpassed the designated reserve
ratio set by law for the balance in the fund to maintain with respect to
bifinsured deposits the fdic has continued these reduced assessment levels
there is legislation pending in a committee in the house of representatives to
change these assessment levels it is uncertain if such legislation will be
enacted and if enacted the form of such legislation

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers
including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and
other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver
failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements
could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and
directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially
substantial civil penalties

corporation competes primarily with detroit and outstate michigan banks for
loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona california

set forth below are summaries of selected laws and regulations applicable to
comerica and its subsidiaries the summaries are not complete and are qualified

change in applicable law or regulation could have a material effect on the
business of comerica

interstate banking and branching

pursuant to the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of
1994 the interstate act a bank holding company became able to acquire banks
in states other than its home state beginning september 29 1995 without
regard to the permissibility of such acquisition under state law but subject to
any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a
minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the
bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control
no more than ten percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in the united states and no more than thirty percent of such
deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law

the interstate act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby
creating interstate branching all of the states in which comericas banking
subsidiaries are located allow interstate branching furthermore under the
interstate act a bank is now able to open new branches in a state in which it
does not already have banking operations if such state enacts a law permitting
such de novo branching

                                        5

page   7


since the provision permitting interstate bank acquisitions became effective
comerica has had enhanced opportunities to acquire banks in any state subject to
approval by the appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies under the
interstate act comerica has the opportunity to consolidate its affiliate banks
to create one bank with branches in more than one state or to establish
branches in different states subject to any state optin and optout
provisions

dividends

comerica is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other
subsidiaries most of comericas revenues result from dividends its bank
subsidiaries pay it there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable
to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by
comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are
discussed below

each state bank subsidiary that is a member of the frs and each national banking
association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb
or the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if
the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in
any year will exceed the total of i such banks retained net income as
defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net
income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years
less any required transfers to surplus further federal regulatory agencies can
prohibit a banking institution or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe
and unsound business practices and could prohibit the payment of dividends if
such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice in
addition comericas state bank subsidiaries that are not members of the frs are
also subject to limitations under state law regarding the amount of earnings
that may be paid out as dividends

at january 1 2001 comericas subsidiary banks without obtaining prior
governmental approvals could declare aggregate dividends of approximately
1045 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years plus an
amount approximately equal to the net profits as measured under current
regulations if any earned for the period from january 1 2001 through the
date of declaration comericas subsidiary banks paid dividends of 339 million
in 2000 261 million in 1999 and 442 million in 1998

source of strength

according to federal reserve board policy bank holding companies are expected
to act as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources
to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a
bank holding company may not be able to provide such support similarly under
the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the
event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the
default of a banking or thrift subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided
to a subsidiary in danger of default the other banking subsidiaries may be
assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions



                                        6

fdicia

fdicia substantially revised the bank regulatory and funding provisions of the
federal deposit insurance act and made revisions to several other federal
banking statutes among other things fdicia requires the federal banking
agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes
five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized
undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically
undercapitalized a depository institutions capital tier will depend upon
where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures
which among others include a tier 1 and total riskbased capital measure and a
leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors

regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that for a
depository institution to be well capitalized it must have a total riskbased
capital ratio of at least 10 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at
least 6 percent a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and not be
subject to any specific capital order or directive for an institution to be
adequately capitalized it must have a total riskbased capital ratio of at least
8 percent a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of at least 4 percent and a tier 1
leverage ratio of at least 4 percent and in some cases 3 percent under
certain circumstances the appropriate banking agency may treat a well
capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution as if the
institution were in the next lower capital category as of december 31 2000
each of the banking subsidiaries of comerica were well capitalized under these
regulations

fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital
distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to
its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
limitations on growth and certain activities and are required to submit an
acceptable capital restoration plan the federal banking agencies may not accept
a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based
on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository
institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be
acceptable the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee
for a specific time period that the institution will comply with such capital
restoration plan the aggregate liability of the parent holding company under
the guaranty is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to 5 percent of the
depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized
and ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring
the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with
respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if
a depository institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan it is
treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized

significantly undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to a number
of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting
stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets
restrictions on interest rates deposits and asset growth and

                                        7

page   9

orders to improve management cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent
banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment
of a receiver or conservator

under fdicia the fdic is permitted to provide financial assistance to an
insured bank before appointment of a conservator or receiver only if i such
assistance would be the least costly method of meeting the fdics insurance
obligations ii grounds for appointment of a conservator or a receiver exist
or are likely to exist in the future iii it is unlikely that the bank can
meet all capital standards without assistance and iv the banks management has
been competent has complied with applicable laws regulations rules and
supervisory directives and has not engaged in any insider dealing speculative
practice or other abusive activity

fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the
operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements
regulatory standards for real estate lending truth in savings provisions the
requirement that a depository institution give 90 days prior notice to customers
and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the
acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are
not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a
waiver from the fdic under regulations relating to the brokered deposit
prohibition comericas united states subsidiary banks are all wellcapitalized
and may accept brokered deposits without restriction

capital requirements

the frb imposes on comerica riskbased capital requirements and guidelines
which are substantially similar to the capital requirements and guidelines
imposed by the frb the occ and the fdic on depository institutions under their
jurisdictions

the frb may set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose
circumstances warrant it for example holding companies experiencing internal
growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions
substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance
on intangible assets the frb also considers a tangible tier 1 leverage ratio
deducting all intangibles and other indications of capital strength in
evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities

the frb fdic and occ rules require comerica to incorporate market and interest
rate risk components into their riskbased capital standards under the market
risk requirements capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk
related to a financial institutions ongoing trading activities

as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of
depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to
establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards for institutions
for which they are the primary federal regulator the standards relate generally
to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and
executive

                                        8

page   10


compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions
that fail to meet such standards

fdic insurance assessments

comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments
on january 1 1994 a riskbased deposit premium assessment system became
effective under which each depository institution is placed in one of nine
assessment categories based on certain capital and supervisory measures the
deposit insurance assessment schedule published by the fdic for the assessment
period commencing january 1 1998 maintained the nine categories but provided
for major reductions in the assessment rates for institutions insured by bif
these reductions occurred because the balance in bif had reached or surpassed
the designated reserve ratio set by law for the balance in the fund to
maintain with respect to bifinsured deposits the fdic has continued these
reduced assessment levels

enforcement powers of federal banking agencies

the frb and other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers
including the power to terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and
other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver
failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements
could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and
directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially
substantial civil penalties

competition

banking is a highly competitive business the michigan banking subsidiary of the
corporation competes primarily with detroit and outstate michigan banks for
loans deposits and trust accounts through its offices in arizona california
colorado connecticut florida georgia indiana illinois nevada ohio and
texas comerica competes with other financial institutions for various types of
loans through its florida branches comerica competes with many companies
including financial institutions for trust business

at yearend 2000 comerica was the largest financial holding company
headquartered in michigan in terms of total assets and deposits based on the
interstate act as described above comerica believes that the level of
competition in all geographic markets will increase in the future comericas
banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries
including savings and loan associations consumer finance companies leasing
companies and credit unions

employees

as of december 31 2000 comerica and its subsidiaries had 8911 fulltime and
