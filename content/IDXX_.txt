to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products refer to “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties we rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us and our direct suppliers with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or singlesource suppliers from time to time we seek to qualify alternative suppliers 

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and singlesource providers include certain catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine t4 crp progesterone and sdma slides vettest slides vetlyte consumables lasercyte dx consumables vetautoread and procyte dx analyzers and consumables sedivue dx urinalysis instruments and consumables and certain components of our internally manufactured analyzers 

vettest and certain catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in december of 2031 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of catalyst and vettest chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary sector excluding the eu other than to idexx 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2034 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements refer to “part i item 1a risk factors” 

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and singlesource suppliers these products include certain diagnostic imaging systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and singlesource suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products refer to “part i item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

we do not generally maintain a significant backlog of orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales

employee turnover and engagement  we monitor employee turnover and engagement to identify opportunities to strengthen our approach to human capital management 

during 2021 our voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 12 our voluntary turnover among managerial and professional staff was approximately 6 with the contraction of the labor force as a result of the global pandemic we have recently experienced the effects of the labor shortage in our staffing we expect the labor shortage to continue in 2022 and will continue to monitor and analyze retention closely to identify any areas of concern 

we regularly conduct companywide employee surveys conducted by a third party to collect employee input 

on our culture their experiences and workplace conditions these survey results provide insights that help us to improve employee engagement our most recent global employee survey received a high level of response and indicated an 82 engagement level given the pandemicrelated impacts on our frontline workers engagement we are actively working to better understand what matters the most to them and what drives their engagement and retention some of the actions taken in 2021 as a result of this increased focus include increasing the frequency of bonus payments to twice per year for our us operations workers and advancing market competitive pay increases as appropriate 

in 2022 we plan to further leverage the insights gained to develop a roadmap for improving frontline worker engagement and retention we are also monitoring the current landscape of wage inflation and labor shortages in connection with our employees overall compensation

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company and our business our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form 10k factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

risk related to the covid19 pandemic 

the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations liquidity financial condition and stock price 

the duration extent and impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic remain uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations liquidity financial condition and stock price the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify aspects of our business practices including the management of and access to our faciliti es employee remote work locations and employee travel an d we may take further actions as may be required by federal state and local governments or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees and customers such actions may disrupt our supply chain logistics network operations facilities and employee workforce which could negatively affect our employees efficiency and productivity our development and introduction of innovative new products and services our ability to manufacture market sell and distribute our products and services and our financial performance in addition public healthrelated guidance and directives including stayathome orders that may be further deployed to combat the spread of covid19 including variants such as delta and omicron and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits labor shortages the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits and disruption of veterinary clinic operations all of which would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our cag products and services which represented 90 of our 2021 consolidated revenues if stayathome orders or other similar public healthrelated directives are reimplemented periodically to combat the spread of covid19 particularly in the united states the negative impact on veterinary service providers and their businesses and correspondingly on demand for our cag products and services may be material 

business lockdowns pool and beach closures and weakened economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic reduced demand for our water testing products in 2020 while our water testing volumes have been recovering during 2021 public healthrelated guidance and directives that may be further deployed to combat the spread of covid19 including variants may significantly reduce demand in addition the ongoing pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur economic weakness in our key geographies related to the covid19 pandemic may also reduce demand for our companion animal water livestock poultry and dairy products and services which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

while demand for our cag products and services remained strong in 2021 the degree to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts us depends on future developments that are unpredictable and most of which are outside of our control including the duration scope and severity of the covid19 pandemic the emergence of new variants changes in infection rates the vaccine participation rate the effectiveness of vaccines the availability of testing kits as well as regulations and requirements impacting the ability of veterinarians to treat patients the return to our offices andor our ability to visit customer sites there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent or mitigate any or all of the covid19 near or longterm adverse impacts any of the foregoing factors or other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations liquidity financial conditions and stock price 

risks related to our business and industry 

because our business lines are highly attractive they are also highly competitive our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability 

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new sector entrants given our performance and the industry’s strong growth and returns our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

• developing manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive inclinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of idexx vetlab instruments grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related recurring sales of consumable products services and accessories 

• developing and introducing new innovative diagnostic tests and services for both our reference laboratories and inclinic applications that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors 

• developing and introducing innovative datainsightful software solutions that increase the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of the information and transactions of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products 

• maintaining premium pricing including by effectively implementing price increases for our differentiated products and services through among other things effective communication and promotion of the value of our products and services in an environment where many of our competitors promote market and sell lesser offerings at prices lower than ours 

• providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools information and resources that enable them to grow their practices and the utilization of our diagnostic products and services through increased pet visits use of preventive care protocols enhanced practice of realtime care and improved practice efficiency 

• achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of reference laboratories by implementing global best practices including lean processing techniques incorporating technological enhancements including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs 

• achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our inclinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead and by improving reliability of our instruments 

• continuing to expand develop and advance the productivity of our companion animal diagnostic sales marketing customer support and logistics organizations in the us and international regions in support of among other things our alldirect sales strategies 

• attracting developing and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy which is challenging due to the increasingly competitive and tight labor markets in which we operate as well as covid19related impacts on the workforce 

• strengthening our sales and marketing activities to continue to grow our profitability both in the us and in geographies outside of the us 

• identifying completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us 

• developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies and 

• continuing to effectively manage our growth and expansion on a global scale through among other things designing and implementing costeffective improvements to our processes procedures and infrastructure 

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

our dependence on thirdparty suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components and raw materials including biological materials for our manufactured products manufacture some of the products that we sell and perform certain services including packagedelivery services actions taken by thirdparty suppliers in operating their business as well as any disruptions to their business operations or their suppliers business operations could disrupt our supply chain or operations and materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs and damage our reputation with our customers longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability 

our supply chain and our cost of goods also may be adversely impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation including wage inflation or to supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods or materials to us on a timely basis or at all we could experience inventory shortages and disruptions in our supply of goods or materials 

for examples of some of the events that could result in disruption to our supply chain or operations and negatively impact our operating results refer to “we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business” and factors and events beyond our control could disrupt our operations supply chain and logistics network and adversely affect our business below 

in addition we currently purchase many products components and materials from sole or single sources some of these products are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products components and materials are used in a majority of our instruments including our catalyst dx catalyst one procyte dx and procyte one analyzers consumables and accessories used in our instruments livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products even if products components and materials were to become available to us from alternative suppliers we likely would incur additional costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all in certain cases we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely 

we seek to mitigate sole and singlesource suppliers risks on a riskprioritized basis and in a variety of ways including when possible by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers developing applicable inhouse manufacturing capabilities and expertise and entering into escrow arrangements for manufacturing information for certain single or solesourced products we also seek to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable or fixed prices however there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of these mitigating activities or that if implemented any of them will be effective in preventing any delay or other disruption in our ability to supply our customers in addition suppliers may decline to enter into longterm contracts for any number of reasons which would require us to purchase products components or raw materials via shortterm contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have longterm contracts will continue to supply our requirements will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts or will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements in cases where we purchase sole and singlesource products components or raw materials under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products components or raw materials in the future from sole and singlesource suppliers or if such sole and singlesource suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products we may be unable to supply our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply our customers   

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products that include biological materials such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products either of which could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply our customers with these products which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

as a global business we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda and the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products as well as the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us and our opti pcr test kits for the detection of the virus that causes covid19 are subject to regulation by the fda and sold and distributed pursuant to emergency use authorizations issued by the fda the methods used by our water testing products must be approved by the epa as a part of its water quality monitoring program before they can be used by customers in the us delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades or any termination revision or revocation of an emergency use authorization for our opti test kits could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the manufacture import and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include but are not limited to the biocidal products regulation which requires the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being manufactured used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of chemicals in the european union the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the electromagnetic compatibility directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive 

compliance with these and similar regulations in the us and abroad may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact 

in addition some foreign governments require us to register or certify our products before they can be distributed or sold and these product registration requirements which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes and provide confidential proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies for example compliance with extensive countryspecific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing marketing and selling our diagnostic products in japan germany canada brazil the netherlands china and many other countries there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can also be no assurance that confidential proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies may not be accessed by 

unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen which could negatively impact our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success for more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services refer to our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation below 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations governing as well as legal and political environments that vary broadly regarding among other things the importation and exportation of products our global business practices such as anticorruption antimoney laundering and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal regulatory and political requirements and environments differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future 

any failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or to adjust to changing legal and political environments could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation any of these could negatively impact our business 

our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation 

we believe our future success significantly depends on our ability to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing differentiated product and service offerings and to develop and introduce new and innovative differentiated products and services as a result we invest substantial funds and efforts into rd investigating new products and technologies being developed by third parties and obtaining certain such new products and technologies through licenses or acquisitions there can be no assurance that our rd licensing or acquisition efforts will achieve expected results when or whether any of our products or services now under development will be launched or whether we may be able to develop license or otherwise acquire new products or technologies we also cannot predict whether any product or service offering once launched will achieve market acceptance or achieve sales and revenue consistent with our expectations 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be adversely affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies to compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition for products previously covered by those patent rights 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition and we expect that future competition will become even more intense as new products services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the space our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic sector in the united states and abroad include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories certain large and wellfunded animal health pharmaceutical companies as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as vca inc which is wholly owned by mars incorporated another operator of corporate hospital chains consolidation among our competitors and our customers may intensify the competition we face while we believe that our offerings are competitively differentiated due to our innovative products and services such as the idexx sdma test and vetconnect plus that offer an integrated comprehensive diagnostic solution and the quality of our technical and customer service there can be no assurance 

that increased consolidation among our competitors or customers as well as any resulting reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers refer to “consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business” below 

competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may emerge through the development of innovative new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new innovative and competitive products and services which could be superior or be perceived by our customers to be superior to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services business combinations and mergers among our competitors may result in competitors that are better positioned to create market and sell more compelling product and service offerings while an important aspect of our strategy is to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors’ products or services or otherwise achieve customer acceptance some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services perceived in the eyes of customers as similar at substantially lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of sales andor revenues or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering certain of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us as well as greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business 

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the veterinary services industry in the us and abroad has been consolidating at an accelerating rate in recent years in the united states the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners pet partners and vca inc and national veterinary associates and are joined by dozens of other consolidators a similar trend exists in other regions such as canada europe australia new zealand china and brazil furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally attempt to shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

demand for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting 

from changes in disease prevalence the outbreak of certain diseases such as african swine fever among livestock or poultry or the adverse impact of climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of such animals in the affected regions reducing herd or flock sizes which could reduce the demand for our testing products for such animals changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products in addition changes and trends in local dairy poultry or other food sectors around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products economic weakness whether or not related to the covid19 pandemic may also reduce demand for our companion animal water livestock poultry and dairy products and services and public healthrelated guidance and directives including stayathome orders that may be further deployed to combat the spread of covid19 and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits and disruption of veterinary clinic operations all of which would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our cag products and services declines in testing for any reason including the reasons described above along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we sell many products through distributors which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

some of our international product sales occur through thirdparty distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products our distributors often offer products from several different companies including our competitors and may promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels and changes in our distributors’ inventory levels as compared to comparable prior periods could negatively impact our revenue growth rates we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results while we maintain a rigorous distribution compliance program violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare and related human laboratory diagnostics sector could inhibit our success in this sector 

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare and related human laboratory medical diagnostics sector and we operate at a small scale in this area this sector differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic sector significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare and laboratory medical diagnostics sector could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this sector that differ from the veterinary diagnostic sector there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare and laboratory medical diagnostics sector comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic sector 

general risks 

we depend on key leadership and talent to succeed and compete effectively 

our continued success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract develop and retain highly capable skilled and diverse employees and leaders as we continue to grow our business expand our geographic scope and develop and offer innovative new products and services we require an engaged qualified workforce and the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for our senior leadership and other key personnel competition for experienced leaders and employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location work environment and development opportunities furthermore the recent pandemicrelated labor force shortages have made it more difficult and costly to attract qualified labor and prolonged shortages could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives 

the loss of the services of or our failure to recruit or develop and implement effective succession plans for our senior leadership or other key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success in addition even if we effectively develop and implement succession plans and make key leadership transitions we cannot provide assurances as to whether we may experience management or other challenges in connection with any of those leadership transitions that could adversely affect our future success 

we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business  

we rely on our information systems as well as our thirdparty business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems to provide access to our webbased products and services keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions although we maintain security policies employ system backup measures and engage in redundancy planning and processes such policies measures planning and processes as well as our current disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems and our business partners and suppliers information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including among other things computer viruses and malware ransomware denial of service actions misappropriation of data and similar events through the internet including via devices and applications connected to the internet and through email attachments and persons with access to these information systems such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business due to governmental mandates and recommended safety measures to control the spread of covid19 we modified aspects of our business practices this has resulted in a greater number of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time which may result in some increased risk of vulnerability or attacks associated with additional individuals accessing our data and systems remotely in addition security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cybersecurity attacks targeting us organizations conducting covid19related research such as idexx 

as information systems and the use of software and related applications by us our business partners suppliers and customers become more cloudbased and connected to the “internet of things” which is inherently susceptible to cyberattacks there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats including more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of data and information we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” such as our connected devices eg idexx vetlab instruments any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen while we have implemented network security and internal control measures especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption attack or security breach and as such the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains 

we and some of our thirdparty vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience further attacks in the future potentially with more frequency to our knowledge most of these attacks have been unsuccessful and none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats which vary in technique and sources if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions or our customers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses and additional costs from remedial actions repairs to infrastructure physical systems or data processing systems increased cybersecurity and information technology protection costs loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition our customers could also face negative consequences such as the compromises of sensitive or critical information or systems furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of data or information including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services damage our ability to develop and protect our rights to our differentiated technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition

factors and events beyond our control could disrupt our operations supply chain and logistics network and adversely affect our business 

our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors and events beyond our control such as natural disasters severe weather conditions andor climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics or pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic civil unrest geopolitical conditions and developments war terrorism or other manmade disasters increases in wages that drive up prices workforce disruptions labor shortages or stoppages the imposition of regulations trade protection measures tariffs duties importexport restrictions quotas or embargoes on key components transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods and the unavailability of raw materials any of these events could result in among other things damage to or the temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be costly and may require substantial leadtime to repair or replace damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our thirdparty business partners or suppliers on which we rely a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets an interruption in power supply a temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain or logistics network including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver or delays in the delivery of our products or services and short or longterm damage to our customers’ businesses which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services for more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers’ operations and supply chain refer to “our dependence on thirdparty suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results” above 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee kornwestheim germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events we also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for potential longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 38 of our overall revenue and approximately 35 89 and 52 of our cag lpd and water revenues respectively were attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including but not limited to disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building staffing and managing foreign operations including a geographically dispersed workforce differing protection of intellectual property trade protection measures quotas embargoes importexport restrictions tariffs duties and regulatory and licensing requirements natural and other disasters public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics the ongoing covid19 pandemic or the prospect of a pandemic ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s regulatory economic or political conditions other unfavorable geopolitical conditions security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

in addition to market and sell many of our products outside the us we are subject to product approval and registration requirements that often require us to provide confidential proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies there can be no assurance that the confidential proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies to comply with product approval and registration requirements may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen which could negatively affect our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success we also may forgo marketing and selling some of our products in certain foreign jurisdictions due to the risk of intellectual property theft which could negatively affect our ability to expand our international operations and business for more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services refer to our success is heavily dependent on our continued differentiated product and service innovation above 

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

the nature of our business involves the receipt storage and use of information including personal data about our customers pet owners suppliers and employees we collect and use personal data in a variety of ways we offer products and services that collect and use personal data including veterinary practice management systems online customer communication tools and services vetconnect plus and twoway integration technology some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various websites and collect contact and other personal data from our customers and website visitors in addition we transfer information including personal data among idexx our subsidiaries and third parties with which we have commercial relations for business purposes our collection protection security retention storage disclosure sharing and use of personal data described above are subject to expanding and increasingly complex laws and regulations in the us and abroad in addition these laws and regulations continue to develop and are subject to frequent revisions and generally have become more stringent over time are subject to differing interpretations may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current global privacy policy and data protection practices compliance with these evolving requirements can be costly require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or delay or impede the development and offering of innovative products and services additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal data can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators in the us and abroad to expand or adopt more stringent regulations and laws examples of laws and regulations that have impacted or could impact our business include 

• the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective in january 2020 gives california residents among other things expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches moreover a new privacy law the california privacy rights act cpra which is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 1 2022 will significantly modify the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies such as ours doing business in california similarly other states such as virginia and colorado have instituted privacy and data security laws rules and regulations and many similar laws have been proposed at the federal and state level all of which may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging the effects of the ccpa crpa and other similar laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply 

• the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of individuals in the european economic area eea and noncompliance can trigger fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4 of global annual revenues 

• following the united kingdom’s uk withdrawal from the eea and the eu on december 31 2020 we became subject to the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom law uk gdpr and noncompliance can trigger fines of up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover the european commission adopted a uk adequacy decision in june 2021 which organizations can rely on for eea to uk personal data transfers this decision will automatically expire four years after its entry into force but it might be renewed provided the uk maintains an adequate level of data protection the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data 

protection law remains unclear however and it is unclear how uk data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated in the long term any changes to these laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply 

• in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union invalidated the euus and swissus privacy shields calling into question data transfers carried out under the european commissions standard contractual clauses “sccs” which has created compliance challenges for our transfer of personal data from the eea andor switzerland to the us and other third countries the european commission updated the sccs on june 4 2021 and additional regulatory guidance has been released that seeks to impose additional obligations on companies seeking to rely on the sccs for such transfers parties transferring personal data from the eea to third countries with “inadequate data protection” such as the us will have until december 27 2022 to update any existing agreements or any new agreements executed before september 27 2021 that rely on sccs the new sccs apply only to the transfer of data outside of the eea and not the uk though on january 31 2022 the uk’s information commissioner’s officer announced that proposals for the uks own form of agreement and addendum to the eu sccs the uk sccs which could be used for transfers for data from the uk have been laid before parliament if no objections are raised in parliament and the proposals are approved the uk sccs will come into force on march 21 2022 subject to a grace period for implementation any transfers by us or our vendors of personal data from the eeauk may not comply with eeauk data protection laws may increase our exposure to the gdpr’suk gdpr’s heightened sanctions for violations of its crossborder data transfer restrictions and may reduce demand for our products from companies subject to europeanunited kingdom data protection laws similar laws have been proposed or passed in other countries which may create additional compliance challenges for crossborder transfers of personal data 

• in august 2021 china passed the new china personal information protection law pipl which became effective november 2021 the pipl provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in china and the processing of personal information of persons in china outside of china if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of persons in china several pipl requirements such as data localization requirements and international cross border transfer restrictions remain unclear as the processing amount thresholds for these requirements have not been implemented by the chinese authorities yet these thresholds could result in data localization practices that may complicate our operations and create additional compliance challenges for crossborder transfers of personal information this may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply the pipl provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in china and the processing of personal information of persons in china outside of china if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of persons in china 

• the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” which became effective in september 2020 and the south african protection of personal information act popia which became effective in july 2020 with a oneyear grace period until june 30 2021 and the amendments to the japanese act on the protection of personal information appi which will enter into full effect in april 2022 are examples of other nonus data privacyrelated laws to which we are subject 

any failure or perceived failure by us the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to comply with all applicable privacyrelated laws and regulations as well as our contractual obligations could result in damage to our reputation or legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others any of which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention disclosure or security of personal data or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could damage our reputation and harm our business 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the nature of our global operations subjects us to local state regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation additionally tax 

rules governing crossborder activities are continually subject to modification as a result of coordinated actions by governments and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques 

in april 2021 the current us administration proposed comprehensive corporate tax reforms including among other things an increased tax rate and the promotion of a global minimum tax rate in addition in june 2021 finance leaders of the group of seven countries agreed to back a new global minimum tax rate that would apply regardless of the location of headquarters or physical presence and in october 2021 136 countries including all group of twenty countries agreed to the oecd’s global corporate tax reform plan which would aim to modify the determination of taxable presence for digital activities and provide for a global minimum tax rate furthermore in december 2021 the dutch government modified its tax laws and regulations eliminating the benefits under our dutch tax ruling for fiscal years beginning after december 31 2021 

while we have taken and may take further actions intended to align our corporate structure and intercompany relationships with supporting our growth in international markets and maintaining operational and tax efficiency and continue to consider all of these developments within our overall tax strategy changes in tax law in the us and other countries in which we operate or have a presence may materially and adversely impact our income tax liability provision for income taxes effective tax rate and results of operation and there can be no assurance that any actions we take to maintain operational and tax efficiency will effectively mitigate these impacts moreover these actions may increase our operating costs and if ineffectual could increase our income tax liabilities and our global effective tax rate 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary industry demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices the ongoing covid19 global pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur economic weakness in our significant geographies could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human diagnostic products and services economic weakness related to the ongoing covid19 global pandemic has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all   

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

we are a global business with 38 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies 

for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 23 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 22 for the year ended december 31 2019 a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results refer to “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact 

our foreign currency hedging activities refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 

we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may increase our cost of borrowing and limit our activities 

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing which could limit our ability to execute certain strategies and have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates including rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor exposing us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations under our variablerate credit facility would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same our credit facility includes a provision for the determination of one or more benchmark replacement rates including based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr as a successor to the libor rate 

risks related to an investment in our securities 

fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures and customer marketing and incentive programs changes in the number and type of competitors and their product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall

we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form 10k in the  glossary of terms and selected abbreviations” 

description of business segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information managementbased products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and improve producer efficiency which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business “opti medical” with our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3 revenue recognition and note 17 segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with the highest quality diagnostic information software products and services and medical evidence to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient and effective practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers staff efficiency and expanding practice revenues 

cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro analyzer are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro analyzer are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the demand for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as 

volume commitments such as our idexx 360 program or reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a multiyear customer commitment to purchase recurring products and services 

below is a table showing active installed base units of our diagnostic instruments as of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs a majority of our catalyst chemistry analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account has the highest economic value as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue we also place additional chemistry analyzers at existing large customers where utilization supports multiple analyzers 

we place our premium hematology analyzers through multiple sales programs as well a majority of our procyte analyzer placements were made to new or competitive accounts during the second half of 2020 we began selling our new procyte one analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte dx and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream with our procyte one analyzer we provide customers with consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to the procyte dx analyzer where we charge upon shipment of consumables 

our premium sedivue dx analyzer and singleuse consumable system provides a highly accurate way to automate the process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization similar to the procyte one analyzer other than our procyte one and sedivue analyzers we charge upon shipment of consumables for all our other analyzers 

we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests including by providing the snap pro analyzer which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record our proread software interprets results of the snap pro analyzer these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro analyzer results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings acquiring new customers maintaining high customer loyalty and retention and realizing modest annual price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing workflows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry hematology and urinalysis instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to 

handle compromised samples analytical capability of diagnostics software integration with the ivls and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2021 recurri ng diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounted for approximately 79 of our consolidated revenue 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as demonstrated by peerreviewed thirdparty research as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro analyzer we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnosti c testing 

the prevalence of inclinic testing as opposed to outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories may vary by region we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a differentiated test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint new laboratories may operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally may have a negative effect on our operating margin 

recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers net of customer losses we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs and our volume commitment programs our upfront customer loyalty programs are associated with customer acquisitions and retention and provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear contractual agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services including reference laboratory services our volume commitment programs such as idexx 360 provide 

customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices including drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

livestock poultry and dairy 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer differentiated tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease reproductive and herd health and production management programs our rapid visual pregnancy test and alertys onfarm pregnancy test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding these tests provide a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples 

disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate 

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business which also leverages the snap platform the dairy snap products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to suc cessfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in dairy processors 

other 

opti medical  our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics sector worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

during 2020 we introduced the opti sarscov2 rtpcr test kit for human covid19 testing a significant portion of the growth in our opti medical business was from revenue generated from the test kits and related laboratory services the future demand for this product is difficult to project given the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic including shortterm project commitments available pcr testing capacity alternative suppliers and the potential impact of vaccinations and other treatments 

our facility in roswell georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte requirements of certain cag products we leverage this facility’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

  

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a description of the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

we enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of idexx products and services determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment we determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized we evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts 

we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation we utilize the observable standalone selling price when available which represents the price charged for the performance obligation when sold separately when standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including but not limited to the cost plus a margin approach 

our upfront loyalty programs provide customers with incentives in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement they are required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both upfront incentives to customers in the form of cash or idexx points are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as customer acquisition costs within other current and longterm assets which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases less upfront incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer contract and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 13 million at december 31 2021 

our volume commitment programs such as our idexx 360 program provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer which is also when the customer obtains control of the 

instrument based on legal title transfer our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and longterm assets the contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for future products and services over the term of the contract we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer contract and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 40 million at december 31 2021 

our instrument rebate programs require an instrument purchase and provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the program we account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional we allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations including a customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases which is deferred and recognized upon the purchase of future products and services partly offsetting future rebates as they are earned we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer contract and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 20 million at december 31 2021 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases customer rebates and other incentive payments and price adjustments related to multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition as described above 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when significant we typically utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be separately identified and recognized 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with intellectual property that has been or may be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic anticipated changes in product supply chain or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon 

management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach that allows the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and instead proceeded directly to assessing the fair value of all of our reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value to determine if any impairment exists 

we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit to validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our total market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

the results of our most recent goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units with a minimum of approximately 65 and a weighted average of approximately 1375 in total the majority of our goodwill is related to our cag diagnostics reporting units with a weighted average of approximately 1550 excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount including our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services rapid assay products and idexx vetlab consumables instruments services and accessories 

we also maintain approximately 94 million of goodwill associated with our veterinary software and services reporting unit which is primarily comprised of recent acquisitions of earlystage software companies that expand our suite of technology applications for the veterinary profession including saasbased practice management systems applications that extend workflow capabilities client marketing wellness plan management and other connectivity and communication needs these software applications are in various stages of commercial development and therefore our veterinary software and services reporting unit has a relatively lower excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount as indicated by the results of our most recent goodwill impairment test which indicated approximately 385 million and 210 of the reporting unit’s carrying value realization of this goodwill is dependent on our successful commercialization of these software applications 

additionally we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical intellectual property outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 42 million and approximately 65 of the reporting unit’s carrying value 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets other than goodwill based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the asset group is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows associated with the intangible asset are largely independent the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of the asset group exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate we had no impairments of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2019 the amount of impairment for the year ended december 31 2020 was immaterial 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 255 million as of december 31 2021 and 260 million as of december 31 2020 which includes estimated interest expense and penalties refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 14 income taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 2 summary of significant accounting policies v and w to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 included in this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements adopted and not adopted 

results of operations and trends 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

sector trends and covid19 pandemic impact  the primary impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been seen in our cag business while veterinary care is widely recognized as an “essential” service stayathome policies deployed to combat the spread of covid19 constrained visits to veterinary practices significantly in late march 2020 through early april 2020 pressuring diagnostic testing volumes restrictions on sales professionals’ access to veterinary clinics also contributed to deferrals on new cag instrument placements 

as stayathome policies were relaxed there was a sharp rebound in clinical visit activity which accelerated through the second quarter of 2020 and continued through the second half of 2020 weekly us companion animal practice data showed improvement in samestore clinical visits trends since midapril 2020 and solid cag market momentum continued in early 2021 

companion animal sector improvement trends globally have supported a strong recovery in demand for cag diagnostic products and services global cag diagnostics recurring revenues declined approximately 16 in april 2020 followed by increases of approximately 8 in may 2020 30 in june 2020 24 in july 2020 and approximately 20 for the remainder of the third and fourth quarters of 2020 

during 2021 positive trends in companion animal healthcare continued to support strong growth for cag diagnostic products and services across regions us samestore clinical visit growth at veterinary practices was 12 in the first quarter of 2021 13 in the second quarter and 2 in both the third and fourth quarters of 2021 these clinical visit gains in the second half of 2021 are compared to strong prior year period clinical visit growth which included benefits from pentup demand from delayed veterinary visits during the covid19 pandemic as policies and restrictions were relaxed 

while these trends are encouraging potential effects related to ongoing covid19 case management efforts are challenging to predict and may pressure future revenues should enhanced social distancing policies and higher infection rates impact veterinary clinic operations in certain regions at the beginning of 2022 we are monitoring the increase in omicron cases globally including impacts on factors like veterinary practice staffing levels which may impact clinic level growth 

we have also seen impacts from the covid19 pandemic on water testing volumes there was some disruption to compliance water testing early in the second quarter of 2020 related to business lockdown effects as well as beach and pool closures which has since had a solid recovery approximately 20 of our water revenues are related to noncompliance testing which declined due to reduced overall business activity and prioritization of laboratory spending during 2021 our water testing volumes continued to recover for both compliance and noncompliance testing 

lpd revenues which expanded 10 in 2020 and contracted by 7 in 2021 were impacted by reduced demand for african swine fever testing in china reflecting the relaxation of local african swine fever disease management programs as well as additional impacts in china from lower pork prices and changing government requirements related to live animal imports and livestock infectious disease programs beginning in the second quarter of 2021 we anticipate continued pressure on lpd revenues in the first half of 2022 related to these factors 

human covid19 testing  on may 7 2020 we announced that opti medical was granted by the united states food and drug administration fda an emergency use authorization eua for the opti sarscov2 rtpcr laboratory test kit for the detection of sarscov2 the virus that causes covid19 on june 5 2020 opti medical announced that it has received the ce mark certification in the european union for its opti sarscov2 rtpcr laboratory test kit additionally the fda has granted eua for the new opti dnarna magnetic bead kit for nucleic acid extraction from respiratory samples to be used with the opti sarscov2 rtpcr test kit which enables opti medical systems to provide laboratories with a complete opti medical systemsmanufactured workflow solution for covid19 testing we also provide human covid19 testing laboratories services to the maine center for disease control and prevention in support of their covid19 testing program these products and services are included within our opti medical business in our other segment 

and are the primary driver of growth in that segment we anticipate that revenues from these products will decline in 2022 as we focus our growth efforts on idexx core businesses 

in managing our businesses we continue to provide high levels of service delivery and product support for customers during this time and maintain high health and safety standards to protect the health and safety of our employees and their families and our communities and ensure business continuity many of our employees continue to work remotely for our laboratory and warehouse employees that are required to work onsite we have enhanced safety procedures and protocols to help protect the health of our employees 

supply chain and logistics challenges  we believe that building and maintaining a wellmanaged and disciplined infrastructure have helped minimize impacts of the covid19 pandemicrelated supply chain constraints including product and component availability issues logistics challenges including extended shipping periods and delays and inflationary pressures that are currently occurring worldwide our proactive approach to managing our operational processes including forward planning with a focus on working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners has enabled us to maintain continued high levels of product and service availability and customer service although we expect the current supply chain and logistics challenges to continue in 2022 we believe we are well positioned to enable sustained high growth in our businesses going forward and to effectively manage the impacts of potentially relatively higher costs in certain areas to support these growth plans however there can be no assurance as to the duration or severity of the supply chain and logistics challenges or the effectiveness of our mitigating activities 

distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

in certain countries we sell our products through thirdparty distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates refer to “part i item 1 business marketing and distribution” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding distribution channels 

currency impact  for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 23 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 22 for the year ended december 31 2019 strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues refer to “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates refer to “part i item 1a risk factors” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts 

effects of economic conditions  demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil and inflationary pressure can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides 

a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services 

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our customers partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

effects of patent expiration  although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2021 and several that are expected to expire in 2022 and beyond the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in part i item 1 business patents and licenses” 

nongaap financial measures  the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth” organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates certain business acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

we exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period 

we also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends we consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs processes and outputs are present consistent with asu 201701 “ business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business ” in a business combination if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets we do not consider these assets to be a business a typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business such as employees or infrastructure we believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth 

we also use adjusted ebitda gross debt net debt gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio all of which are nongaap financial measures that should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for financial measures presented according to us gaap management believes that reporting these nongaap financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility

total company 

the following table presents revenue by operating segment by us and nonus or international geographies 



1 reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding 

total company revenue  the increase in both us and international organic revenues was driven by strong volume gains in cag diagnostics recurring revenue reflecting continued high demand for companion animal diagnostics globally supported by an increase in clinical visits and diagnostic utilization per clinical visit as compared to 2020 our cag diagnostics instru ment revenue reflects high placement volumes compared to the prior year which was impacted by the global pandemic the higher revenue in our water business was primarily a result of the continued improvement in noncompliance testing that has been constrained since the beginning of the pandemic and disruptions in certain compliance testing during the prior year the decline in our lpd business was primarily due to the lower demand for african swine fever testing in china the impact of currency movements on revenue was immaterial 

the following table presents our total company results of operations 



gross profit  gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes and an 80 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to volume leverage in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio following the initial pandemic impacts in the first half of the prior year price increases and strong growth in veterinary soft ware services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues these increases were partially offset by product mix with higher cag diagnostics instrument revenue and higher freight and distribution costs the impact from foreign currency movements did not have a material impact on gross profit 

operating expenses  overall operating expenses were higher compared to 2020 during which cost containment efforts were implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary reductions to compensation and benefits and travel costs sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs including investments in our global commercial capability general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs and costs associated with acquisitions these increases were partially offset by an accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter and higher charitable donations in the prior year research and development expense increased primarily due to increased project and personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses by approximately 1 

companion animal group   

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 



1 reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding 

cag diagnostics recurring revenue  s trong demand for companion animal diagnostics globally across modalities including higher levels of growth in testing volumes following the initial pandemic impacts which constrained volumes beginning in midmarch 2020 through may 2020 resulted in higher volume growth this volume growth includes an increase in clinical visits and diagnostic utilization per clinical visi t the increase in c ag diagnostics recurring revenue was p rimarily due to volume growth in idexx vetlab consumables reference laboratory diagnostic services and rapid assay products and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

the increase in idexx vetlab consumables revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes for our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte consumables these increases were supported by an increase in testing utilization across regions high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted primarily from higher clinic testing levels primarily from snap ® 4dx plus as well as higher realized prices results reflected strong growth in all major regions 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to higher testing volumes globally particularly in the us as well as higher average unit sales prices acquisitions increased revenue by 05 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue  the increase in instrument revenue was primarily due to strong premium instrument placements globally including our new procyte one analyzer as compared to constrained placements in 2020 as a result of the global pandemic due to restrictions on our sales professionals’ access to clinics and certain customers’ deferral of new instrument purchases 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue  acquisitions increased revenue 105 excluding the impact of acquisitions the increase in veterinary software and services revenue was primarily due to increases in our active installed base higher veterinary software system placements and higher realized prices on these service offerings the increase in our diagnostic imaging systems revenues was primarily due to higher imaging systems placements specifically our imagevue dr 30 platform as compared to 2020 when diagnostic imaging placements were lower due to restrictions on our 

sales professionals’ access to clinics and certain customers deferring purchase decisions as a result of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by a decrease in diagnostic imaging instrument revenue impacted by a reduction in earlier generation instrument platform sales 

the following table presents the cag segment results of operations 



gross profit  gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volumes as well as a 120 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefit of volume leverage and price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio and higher veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues these favorable factors were partially offset by product mix with higher cag diagnostics instrument revenue and higher product freight and distribution costs the impact from foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on our gross profit 

operating expenses  overall operating expenses were higher compared to 2020 during which cost containment efforts were implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary reductions to compensation and benefits and travel costs sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs including investments in our global commercial capability partially offset by lower travel costs general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs and costs associated with acquisitions these increases were partially offset by an accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter and a charitable donation in the prior year research and development expense increased primarily due to increased project and personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses by approximately 1 

water 

the following table presents the water segment results of operations 



revenue  the increase in our water business was primarily a result of the recovery in overall testing volumes including continued improvement in noncompliance testing volume that has been constrained since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic and disruptions in certain compliance testing areas due to social distancing policies the increase in revenue to a lesser extent was also due to the benefit of price increases in our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli testing the impact of currency movements increased revenue by approximately 22 

gross profit  gross profit for water increased due to higher sales volumes despite a 140 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin which reflected a 50 basis point reduction due to foreign currency movements incl uding the impact of hedge losses in the current year compared to hedge gains in the prior year the gross profit margin was further reduced by higher product distribution and freight costs partially offset by the net benefit of price increases 

operating expenses  overall operating expenses were higher compared to 2020 during which cost containment efforts were implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary reductions to compensation and benefits and travel costs sales and marketing increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs including sales incentive compensation general and administration and research and development expenses increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately 1 

livestock poultry and dairy 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 



revenue  the favorable impact of foreign currency movements increased revenue by 23 excluding the impact of currency overall revenues decreased primarily due to lower demand for diagnostic testing in china partially offset by higher testing volumes and realized prices in europe and the americas as compared to pandemic impacts in the prior year beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter we experienced lower livestock test volumes in china as changes in disease management approaches lower pork prices and changes in government requirements related to live animal imports and livestock infectious disease programs unfavorably impacted test volumes in comparison to high prioryear demand for african swine fever testing 

gross profit  the decrease in lpd gross profit was primarily due to lower sales volumes and a 120 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin the decrease in the gross profit margin is primarily due to higher distribution and freight costs and lower realized prices partially offset by lower product costs the impact from foreign currency movements was immaterial for the year 

operating expenses  overall operating expenses were higher compared to 2020 during which cost containment efforts were implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary reductions to compensation and benefits and travel costs sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs as well as higher marketing and promotional materials costs  partially offset by lower sales incentive compensation general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs partially offset by an impairment of an intangible asset associated with our food safety and dairy business in the fourth quarter of 2020 and an increase in the bad debt reserve during the first half of 2020 research and development expense increased primarily due to h igher personnelrelated costs as we leveraged lpd personnel to support our human covid19 testing initiatives in the prior year and software development costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately 15 

other 

the following table presents the other results of operations 



revenue  the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower opti covid19 pcr testing products and services primarily due to lower international volume as well as lower royalty revenue associated with intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line these decreases were partially offset by higher opti medical consumables sales we currently estimate that future demand for our opti covid19 pcr testing products and services will continue to be lower than prior periods although it is difficult to project given the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic the impact of currency movements increased revenues by 09 

gross profit  the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower sales volumes and a gross profit margin decrease of 780 basis points the decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily due to higher product costs associated with writedowns of excess covid19 testing inventory in the current year and lower mix benefits primarily from lower royalty revenue associated with our former pharmaceutical product line the overall change in currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on gross profit 

operating expenses    sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs associated with our opti covid19 pcr product and services general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions as compared to the prior year for all operating segments which are reported within our other segment research and development expense decreased primarily due to lower project costs associated with the development of the opti covid19 pcr test in the prior year 

nonoperating items 

interest expense  interest expense was 298 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 331 million for the prior year the decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of lower average debt levels 

our effective income tax rate was 175 for the year ended december 31 2021 and 121 for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase in our effective tax rate during 2021 was primarily due to the prior year onetime positive impact related to the enactment of tax reform in switzerland related to the transitional benefits as well as higher tax benefits in the prior year related to sharebased compensation our projected effective tax rate for 2022 is approximately 22 this projected increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower estimated tax benefits from sharebased compensation as well as the estimated impacts of international tax changes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations proceeds from longterm senior note financings and amounts available under our credit facility we generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our companion animal veterinary livestock poultry dairy and water products and services consulting services and other various systems and services our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees inventory and supplies taxes research and development capital expenditures rents occupancyrelated charges interest expense and business acquisitions at december 31 2021 we had 1445 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 3839 million on december 31 2020 working capital including our credit facility totaled 1921 million at december 31 2021 as compared to 4800 million at december 31 2020 additionally at december 31 2021 we had a remaining borrowing availability of 9251 million under our 1 billion credit facility which in december 2021 was amended and extended to december 2026 we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future we may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to raise capital in the us through the incurrence of debt or equity issuances which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all in addition these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

the following table presents cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries

2 inventory turns represent inventoryrelated cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarterend divided by the average inventory balances at the beginning and end of each quarter 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents cash provided used 



operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 1075 million during 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to the increase in net income partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities the increase in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower deferred tax benefits in the current year as related to the enactment of tax reform in switzerland in the prior year as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense in the current year primarily related to the completion of our major facilities projects early in 2020 and amortization of intangible assets from current year acquisitions as well as higher sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents cash flows used provided from changes in operating assets and liabilities 



cash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year decreased approximately 1058 million the change in other assets and liabilities was due to higher payroll and income tax payments as compared to the prior year when the timing of these payments was deferred under covid19 stimulus guidance as well as higher incentive payments and higher investments in customer commitment programs to support instrument placements additionally the prior year included a noncash operating expense related to an ongoing litigation matter the increase in cash used for inventory as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher inventory levels to support increasing demand and to mitigate potential supplychain disruptions the change in accounts receivable was primarily due to an acceleration of sales in the later part of 2020 related to pentup demand resulting from the covid19 pandemic resulting in high levels of growth in our accounts receivable during the prior year the change in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of payments at the end of the year as well as increases in activity to support infrastructure and capacity growth 

we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned 

investing activities    cash used by investing activities was 2930 million during 2021 as compared to 1094 million used during 2020 the increase in cash used by investing activities during 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to business acquisitions completed during 2021 including a cloudbased veterinary software business 

our total capital expenditure plan for 2022 is estimated to be approximately 180 million which includes capital investments in a new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion to support growth 

financing activities  cash used by financing activities was 6974 million during 2021 as compared to 2484 million used during 2020 the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the increase in repurchases of our common stock as compared to the prior year during which we suspended repurchases due to the covid19 pandemic cash was also used to pay off our 50 million 2021 series a notes when due and payable on july 21 2021 we also generated cash from outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 735 million on december 31 2021 during 2020 we repaid borrowings under our credit facility in the amount of 2896 million and borrowed 2000 million through the issuance and sale of 10year 250 fixedrate senior notes as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility 

cash used to repurchase shares of our common s tock increased by 5640 million during 2021  as compared to 2020 due to the uncertainty of the duration and magnitude of the covid19 pandemic and its impacts during 2020 we suspended our open market share repurchase activity beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we resumed share repurchases during the first quarter of 2021 from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2021 we have repurchased 680 million shares for 50 billion during 2021 we purchased 13 million shares for an aggregate cost of 7555 million as compared to purchases of 07 million shares for an aggregate cost of 1796 million during 2020 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price we primarily fund our share repurchases with cash generated from operations as well as from various capital market activities including the committed available financing through our credit facility refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20 repurchases of common stock to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases

effect of currency translation on cash  the net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries these changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change the value of a currency depends on many factors including interest rates and the issuing governments debt levels and strength of economy 

offbalance sheet arrangements  we have no offbalance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and thirdparty guarantees as reflected in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13 debt and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 16 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 included in this annual report on form 10k respectively 

financial covenant  the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation as defined in the senior note agreements and credit facility not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreements the following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation 



commitments contingencies and guarantees 

for more information regarding our commitments contingencies and guarantees refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 16 commitments contingencies and guarantees 

for more information on our future lease payments refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8 leases for our minimum lease payment schedule the expected timing of payments of our leases may be different in future years depending on decisions to extend lease terms andor enter into additional leases in the preceding years 

for more information on our repayment of our senior notes refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13 debt 

we also have purchase obligations that including agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are contractually enforceable and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities pricing and approximate timing of purchases as of december 31 2021 we have approximately 3771 million in purchase obligations due in 2022 our purchase obligations beyond 2022 are approximately 443 million expected timing of payments of our purchase obligations is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

additionally we have agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2021 and 2020 and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees 

as of december 31 2021 our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 is 270 million our prior overpayments continue to satisfy our installment obligations through 2022 in 2023 our installment obligation will exceed our remaining overpayment and we will be required to remit the balance due on the installment our final installment will be paid in 2025 for information on our unrecognized tax benefits refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 14 income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and effects of inflation our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2021 approximatel y 23 o f our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 and 22 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency except four of our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the us dollar 

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary 

the following table presents the estimated foreign currency exchange impact on our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the current period and as compared to the respective prioryear period 



based on projected revenues and expenses for 2022 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 12 million and operating income by approximately 7 million additionally we project our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of december 31 2021 would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 3 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate the effect of a stronger us dollar will have a unfavorable effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ended december 31 2022 by approximately 55 million 9 million and 008 per share respectively this unfavorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to increase total company operating profit by approximately 18 million and diluted earnings per share by 016 during the year ending december 31 2022 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 112 the british pound at 134 the canadian dollar at 078 and the australian dollar at 071 and the 

japanese yen at ¥117 the chinese renminbi at rmb 647 and the brazilian real at r574 to the us dollar for the full year of 2022 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 hedging instruments to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2021 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we target to hedge approximately 75 to 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 2867 million at december 31 2021 and 2027 million at december 31 2020 at december 31 2021 we had 82 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of related tax for more information on our hedge agreements refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 hedging instruments

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 9 2026 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 9 2026 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility predominantly have a stated term between 1 and 180 days at december 31 2021 we had 735 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2021 based on our gross leverage ratio our borrowing costs under the credit facility were approximately 11 

inflation generally impacts us by increasing our costs of labor material transportation and general overhead costs the rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a material impact on our financial statements as inflationary cost increases have been more than offset by net realized annual price increases and productivity gains we cannot reasonably estimate our ability to successfully recover any impact of inflation cost increases into the future

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties we rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us and our direct suppliers with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers from time to time we seek to qualify alternative suppliers 

  instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include certain catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine t4 crp progesterone and sdma slides vettest slides vetlyte consumables lasercyte dx consumables vetautoread and procyte dx analyzers 

and consumables sedivue dx urinalysis instruments and consumables and certain components of our internally manufactured analyzers 

vettest and certain catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in december of 2031 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of catalyst and vettest chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market excluding the eu other than to idexx 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2034 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain diagnostic imaging systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

we do not generally maintain a significant backlog of orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales

our veterinary diagnostic slide and instrument systems including t4 fructosamine progesterone crp and sdma are veterinary medical devices regulated by the fda under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” other fda regulated products include our nonlicensed rapid assay products such as snap pancreatic lipase cortisol bile acid foal igg and probnp while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to fda inspections or the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” the fdc act specifies that these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded 

  water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

  human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class i andor class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application these opti products are also subject to the regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold including the in vitro diagnostic regulation in europe which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics 

human covid19 test products  opti manufactures sells and distributes pcr and antibody elisa test kits for the detection of the virus that causes covid19 these test kits are subject to regulation by the fda pursuant to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and more specifically are sold and distributed pursuant to fda emergency use authorization these products are also subject to the european medical device directives which requires ceivd marking and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

  other environmental regulations  all idexx products must comply with applicable global product regulations including those governing consumer product safety and materials requirements such as the europeans unions electromagnetic compatibility emc directive the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances reach the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive these complex regulatory requirements create risk to idexx’s ability to market and sell our products our business and our financial performance for more information about the risks associated with various us and foreign government regulation see various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business  under part i item 1a risk factors 

in the european union our analyzers and certain associated equipment are subject to the requirements of the rohs directive which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment other countries including china russia the united arab emirates and turkey have implemented or anticipate implementing regulatory regimes similar to the rohs directive our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the european medical device directive or the in vitro diagnostic directive which are both strictly applicable to human use products however these systems are required to meet ce certification which required compliance with the rohs directive the emc directive and other safety requirements similar requirements are specified by most counties in which we sell our products and are subject to increasing harmonization globally 

the european union was among the first to regulate and restrict the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products these requirements include the biocidal products regulation which requires the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being exported to the european union and reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere such as turkey korea and other countries may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products some of our products including some of our companion animal products may be subject to pending restriction of microplastics pursuant to reach 

in the us the epa regulates chemical use similarly to the eu in addition certain states have their own chemical regulations such as californias proposition 65 which requires businesses to provide warnings to california residents about significant risk of exposures to chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer birth defects or other reproductive harm 

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and we are also subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act import and export laws and regulations including us import and export control and sanctions laws and laws and regulations governing the collection use retention 

sharing and security of data development or acquisition of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company and our business our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form 10k factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

risk related to the covid19 pandemic 

the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations liquidity financial condition and stock price 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has increased economic uncertainty caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur and disrupted business activity if weakened economic conditions reduce our customers ability or willingness to pay for our products and service or our suppliers ability to provide products and services to us then our business results of operation liquidity financial condition and stock price could be negatively impacted and these impacts could be material 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify aspects of our business practices including the management of and access to our faciliti es employee remote work locations and employee travel an d we may take further actions as may be required by federal state and local governments or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees and customers such actions may disrupt our supply chain operations facilities and employee workforce which could negatively affect our employees efficiency and productivity our development and introduction of innovative new products and services our ability to manufacture market and sell our products and services and our financial performance in addition the social distancing procedures and guidelines including stayathome orders that may be further deployed to combat the spread of covid19 and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits and disruption of veterinary clinic operations all of which would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our cag products and services which represented 88 of our 2020 consolidated revenues if stayathome orders are reimplemented periodically to combat the spread of covid19 particularly in the united states the negative impact on veterinary service providers and their businesses and correspondingly on demand for our cag products and services may be material 

weakened economic conditions caused by the effects of the covid19 pandemic have reduced and may further reduce demand for our water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and dairy products due to reduced testing or disruptions in livestock poultry dairy or other food supply and distribution chains and markets that could negatively impact the related production markets if economic slowdowns continue or recur the decline in our customers demand for our water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and dairy products may be significant 

in the second quarter of 2020 we began selling our new opti covid19 human pcr test products and services and these sales were the primary contributor to our other segments revenue growth in 2020 the future demand for these products and services and our other covid19related products and services is difficult to project given the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic including shortterm project commitments available pcr testing capacity alternative suppliers and the potential impact of vaccinations and other treatments and there can be no assurance that sales of this product and our other covid19related products and services will continue 

while demand for our cag products and services recovered in the latter half of 2020 this recovery was due in part to pentup demand following a period during which access to veterinary clinics was constrained due to governmental policies demand also increased in the second half of 2020 driven by other factors including an increase in pet ownership and higher levels of diagnostic test frequency and utilization which may have been aided by factors related to the pandemic there can be no assurance that this increased demand will be sustained and the environment remains uncertain the degree to which the covid19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business results of operations liquidity financial condition and stock price depends on future developments that are unpredictable and most of which are outside of our control including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the availability and effectiveness of vaccinations and other treatment related governmental advisories and restrictions to contain covid19 and how quickly economic conditions improve once the covid19 pandemic subsides there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent or mitigate any or all of the covid19 near or longterm adverse impacts which could be material 

risks related to our business and industry 

because our business lines are highly attractive they are also highly competitive our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability 

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants given our performance and the market’s strong growth and returns our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

• developing manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive inclinic laboratory analyzers that drive sales of idexx vetlab instruments grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related recurring sales of consumable products services and accessories 

• developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services for both our reference laboratories and inclinic applications that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors 

• increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of the information and transactions of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products 

• maintaining premium pricing including by effectively implementing price increases for our differentiated products and services through among other things effective communication and promotion of the value of our products and services in an environment where many of our competitors promote market and sell lesser offerings at prices lower than ours 

• providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools information and resources that enable them to grow their practices and the utilization of our diagnostic products and services through increased pet visits use of preventive care protocols and enhanced practice of realtime care 

• achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of reference laboratories by implementing global best practices including lean processing techniques incorporating technological enhancements including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs 

• achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our inclinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead and by improving reliability of our instruments 

• continuing to expand develop and advance the productivity of our companion animal diagnostic sales marketing customer support and logistics organizations in the us and international markets in support of among other things our alldirect sales strategies 

• attracting developing and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy which is challenging due to the increasingly competitive and tight labor markets in which we operate 

• expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the us and in geographies outside of the us 

• identifying completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us 

• developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies and 

• continuing to effectively manage our growth and expansion on a global scale through among other things designing and implementing costeffective improvements to our processes procedures and infrastructure 

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

our dependence on thirdparty suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components and raw materials including biological materials for our manufactured products manufacture some of the products that we sell and perform certain services including packagedelivery services actions taken by thirdparty suppliers in operating their business as well as any disruptions to their business operations or their suppliers business operations could disrupt our supply chain or operations and materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs and damage our reputation with our customers longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability for examples of some of the events that could result in disruption to our supply chain or operations and negatively impact our operating results see “we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business” and factors and events beyond our control including natural and other disasters and climate changerelated events could disrupt our operations or our supply chain and adversely affect our business below 

in addition we currently purchase many products components and materials from sole or single sources some of these products are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products components and materials are used in a majority of our instruments including our catalyst dx catalyst one and procyte dx consumables and accessories used in our instruments livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products even if products components and materials were to become available to us from alternative suppliers we likely would incur additional costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all in certain cases we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely 

we seek to mitigate sole and single source suppliers risks on a riskprioritized basis and in a variety of ways including when possible by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers developing applicable inhouse manufacturing capabilities and expertise and entering into escrow arrangements for manufacturing information for certain single or solesourced products we also seek to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable or fixed prices however there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of these mitigating activities or that if implemented any of them will be effective in preventing any delay or other disruption in our ability to supply the market in addition suppliers may decline to enter into longterm contracts for any number of reasons which would require us to purchase products components or raw materials via shortterm contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have longterm contracts will continue to supply our requirements will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts or will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements in cases where we purchase sole and single source products components or raw materials under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products components or raw materials in the future from sole and single source suppliers or if such sole and single source suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products that include biological materials such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products either of which could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

as a global business we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda and the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products as well as the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us and our opti pcr test kits for the detection of the virus that causes covid19 are subject to regulation by the fda and sold and distributed pursuant to emergency use authorizations issued by the fda our water testing products must be approved by the epa as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades or any termination revision or revocation of an emergency use authorization for our test kits could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the manufacture import and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include the biocidal products regulation which requires the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being manufactured used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union the restriction of hazardous substancesrohs directive which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the electromagnetic compatibility directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive 

compliance with these and similar regulations in the us and abroad may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact 

in addition some foreign governments require us to register our products before they can be distributed or sold and these product registration requirements which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes and provide confidential proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies for example compliance with extensive countryspecific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing and marketing our diagnostic products in japan germany canada brazil the netherlands china and many other countries there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can also be no assurance that confidential proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen which could negatively impact our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success for more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services see our success is heavily dependent on our continued proprietary product and service innovation below 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations governing as well as legal and political environments that vary broadly regarding among other things the importation and exportation of products our global business practices such as anticorruption antimoney laundering and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal regulatory and political requirements and environments differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future 

  

any failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or to adjust to changing legal and political environments could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation any of these could negatively impact our business 

our success is heavily dependent on our continued proprietary product and service innovation 

we believe our future success significantly depends on our ability to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing proprietary product and service offerings and to develop and introduce new and innovative proprietary products and services as a result we invest substantial funds and efforts into rd investigating new products and technologies being developed by third parties and obtaining certain such new products and technologies through licenses or acquisitions there can be no assurance that our rd licensing or acquisition efforts will achieve expected results when or whether any of our products or services now under development will be launched or whether we may be able to develop license or otherwise acquire new products or technologies we also cannot predict whether any product or service offering once launched will achieve market acceptance or achieve sales and revenue consistent with our expectations 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be adversely affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition will become even more intense as new products services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market in the united states and abroad include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories certain large and wellfunded animal health pharmaceutical companies as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as vca inc which is wholly owned by mars incorporated another operator of corporate hospital chains consolidation among our competitors and our customers may intensify the competition we face while we believe that our offerings are competitively differentiated due to our proprietary products and services such as the idexx sdma test and vetconnect plus that offer an integrated comprehensive diagnostic solution and the quality of our technical and customer service there can be no assurance that increased consolidation among our competitors or customers as well as any resulting reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers see “consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business” below 

competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of innovative new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new innovative and competitive products and services which could be superior or be perceived by our customers to be superior to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services business combinations and mergers among our competitors may result in competitors that are better positioned to create market and sell 

more compelling product and service offerings while an important aspect of our strategy is to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors’ products or services or otherwise achieve market acceptance some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services perceived in the eyes of customers as similar at substantially lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering certain of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us as well as greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business 

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the veterinary services industry in the us and abroad has been consolidating at an accelerating rate in recent years in the united states the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners pet partners and vca inc and national veterinary associates and are joined by dozens of smaller consolidators a similar trend exists in other regions such as canada europe australia new zealand china and brazil furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally attempt to shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence the outbreak of certain diseases such as african swine fever among livestock or poultry or the adverse impact of climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of such animals in the affected regions reducing herd or flock sizes which could reduce the demand for our testing products for such animals changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products in addition changes and trends in local dairy poultry or other food markets around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products weakened economic conditions caused by the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic have reduced and may further reduce demand for our water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and dairy products and covid19related social distancing procedures and guidelines including stayathome orders that may be further deployed to combat the spread of covid19 and possible higher infection rates could result in a decrease in companion animal clinical visits the delay of elective procedures and wellness visits and disruption of veterinary clinic operations all of which 

would have a negative effect on veterinary service providers and result in declines in demand for our cag products and services declines in testing for any reason including the reasons described above along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we sell many products through distributors which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

some of our product sales in international markets occur through thirdparty distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products our distributors often offer products from several different companies including our competitors and may promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels and changes in our distributors’ inventory levels as compared to comparable prior periods could negatively impact our revenue growth rates we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results while we maintain a rigorous distribution compliance program violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare and laboratory diagnostics market could inhibit our success in this market 

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare and laboratory medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare and laboratory medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare and laboratory medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

general risks 

we depend on key leadership and talent to succeed and compete effectively 

our continued success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract develop and retain highly capable and skilled senior leadership and other key personnel as we continue to grow our business expand our geographic scope and develop and offer innovative new products and services we require the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for our senior leadership and other key personnel competition for experienced leaders and employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location work environment and development opportunities the loss of the services of or our failure to recruit or develop and implement effective succession plans for our senior leadership or other key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success in addition even if we effectively develop and implement succession plans and make key leadership transitions we cannot provide assurances as to whether we may experience management or other challenges in connection with any of those leadership transitions that could adversely affect our future success 

we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business  

we rely on our information systems as well as our thirdparty business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems to provide access to our webbased products and services keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions although we maintain security policies employ system backup measures and engage in redundancy planning and processes such policies measures planning and processes as well as our current disaster recovery plans may be 

ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems and our business partners and suppliers information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including among other things computer viruses and malware denial of service actions misappropriation of data and similar events through the internet including via devices and applications connected to the internet and through email attachments and persons with access to these information systems such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business due to governmental mandates and recommended safety measures to control the spread of covid19 we modified aspects of our business practices this has resulted in a greater number of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time which may result in some increased risk of vulnerability or attacks associated with additional individuals accessing our data and systems remotely in addition security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cybersecurity attacks targeting us organizations conducting covid19 related research such as idexx 

as information systems and the use of software and related applications by us our business partners suppliers and customers become more cloudbased and connected to the “internet of things” which is inherently susceptible to cyberattacks there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats including more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of data and information we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” such as our connected devices eg idexx vetlab instruments any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen while we have implemented network security and internal control measures especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption attack or security breach and as such the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains 

we and some of our third party vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience further attacks in the future potentially with more frequency to our knowledge most of these attacks have been unsuccessful and none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats which vary in technique and sources if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions or our customers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses and additional costs from remedial actions repairs to infrastructure physical systems or data processing systems increased cybersecurity and information technology protection costs loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition our customers could also face negative consequences such as the compromises of sensitive or critical information or systems furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of data or information including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services damage our ability to develop and protect our rights to our proprietary technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects for more information regarding data and information privacy and protection risks see “our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection” below 

factors and events beyond our control including natural and other disasters and climate changerelated events could disrupt our operations or our supply chain and adversely affect our business 

our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors and events beyond our control such as natural disasters severe weather conditions andor climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics or pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic civil unrest geopolitical conditions and developments such as the united kingdom’s exit from the european union war terrorism or other manmade disasters increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations trade protection measures tariffs duties importexport restrictions quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials any of these events could result in among other things damage to or the temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be 

costly and may require substantial leadtime to repair or replace damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our thirdparty business partners or suppliers on which we rely a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets an interruption in power supply a temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver or delays in the delivery of our products or services and short or longterm damage to our customers’ businesses which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services for more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers’ operations and supply chain see “our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results” above 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee kornwestheim germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events we also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for potential longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 38 of our overall revenue and approximately 90 of our lpd revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including but not limited to disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building staffing and managing foreign operations including a geographically dispersed workforce differing protection of intellectual property trade protection measures quotas embargoes importexport restrictions tariffs duties and regulatory and licensing requirements natural and other disasters public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics the ongoing covid19 pandemic or the prospect of a pandemic ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s regulatory economic or political conditions including as a result of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union other unfavorable geopolitical conditions security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

in addition to market and sell many of our products outside the us we are subject to product approval and registration requirements that often require us to provide confidential proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies there can be no assurance that the confidential proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies to comply with product approval and registration requirements may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen which could negatively affect our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success we also may forgo marketing and selling some of our products in certain foreign jurisdictions due to the risk of intellectual property theft which could negatively affect our ability to expand our international operations and business for more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services see our success is heavily dependent on our continued proprietary product and service innovation below 

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period   

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

the nature of our business involves the receipt storage and use of information including personal data about our customers pet owners suppliers and employees we collect and use personal data in a variety of ways we offer products and services that collect and use personal data including veterinary practice management systems online customer communication tools and services vetconnect plus and twoway integration technology some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various websites and collect contact and other personal data from our customers and website visitors in addition we transfer information including personal data among idexx our subsidiaries and third parties with which we have commercial relations for business purposes our collection protection security retention storage disclosure sharing and use of personal data described above are subject to expanding and increasingly complex laws and regulations in the us and abroad in addition these laws and regulations continue to develop and are subject to frequent revisions and generally have become more stringent over time are subject to differing interpretations may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current global privacy policy and data protection practices compliance with these evolving requirements can be costly require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or delay or impede the development and offering of innovative products and services additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal data can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators in the us and abroad to expand or adopt more stringent regulations and laws examples of laws and regulations that have impacted or could impact our business include 

• the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective in january 2020 gives california residents among other things expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches moreover a new privacy law the california privacy rights act which is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with a lookback to january 1 2022 will significantly modify the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies such as ours doing business in california similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level and if passed such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging the effects of the ccpa and other similar laws may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply 

• the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 imposes stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of individuals in the eea and noncompliance can trigger fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4 of global annual revenues 

• in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union invalidated the euus and swissus privacy shields calling into question data transfers carried out under the european commissions standard contractual clauses which has created compliance challenges for our transfer of personal data from the eea uk andor switzerland to the us and other third countries similar laws have been proposed or passed in other countries which may create additional compliance challenges for crossborder transfers of personal data 

• following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eea and the eu on december 31 2020 we became subject to the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom law and noncompliance can trigger fines of up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover in addition because the european commission has not yet made an adequacy determination regarding the united kingdoms data privacy protection lawful transfers of personal data between these jurisdictions remain unclear the brexit trade and cooperation agreement tca has established a four to sixmonth grace period during which transfers of personal data from the eu to the uk can continue without additional safeguards provided that the uk maintains its pretca data protection laws during this time the european commission may adopt a uk adequacy decision which organizations can then rely on for eu to uk personal data transfers but if no uk adequacy decision is adopted the uk will be considered a third country at the end of the grace period and we will be required to implement additional safeguards for personal data transfers 

• the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” which became effective in september 2020 and the south african protection of personal information act which became effective in july 2020 with a oneyear grace period until june 30 2021 are examples of other nonus data privacyrelated laws to which we are subject 

while we have policies and procedures in place to comply with all applicable privacyrelated laws and regulations including the gdpr ccpa and lgpd as well as our contractual obligations any failure or perceived failure by us the third 

parties with whom we work or our products and services to so comply could result in damage to our reputation or legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others any of which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention disclosure or security of personal data or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could damage our reputation and harm our business 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the nature of our global operations subjects us to local state regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation additionally tax rules governing crossborder activities are continually subject to modification as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques 

we have received a tax ruling from the netherlands that documents our mutual understanding of how existing tax laws apply to our circumstances this ruling expires as of december 31 2022 and we have been informed that it will not be renewed due to changes to the advance ruling policy in the netherlands while the absence of an advance agreement does not preclude our ability to continue to apply existing tax laws in the same manner as allowed by the existing ruling the lack of such agreement creates uncertainty as to our future tax rate further the netherlands has recently announced proposals to modify existing rules that if enacted could eliminate the benefits to which this ruling applies we continue to consider these developments within our overall tax strategy 

additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers and several are in various stages of litigation while we believe that our rulings are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices the ongoing covid19 global pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and caused economic slowdowns that may continue or recur economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human diagnostic products and services economic weakness in our markets related to the ongoing covid19 global pandemic has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all   

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

we are a global business with 38 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies 

for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 21 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 22 for both years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact in addition there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union especially between the us dollar and the british pound 

our foreign currency hedging activities see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 

we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may increase our cost of borrowing and limit our activities 

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing which could limit our ability to execute certain strategies and have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates including rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor exposing us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations under our variablerate credit facility would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same our credit facility includes a provision for the determination of a benchmark replacement rate as a successor to the libor rate 

risks related to an investment in our securities 

fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors many of which are beyond our control including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures and customer marketing and incentive programs changes in the number and type of competitors and their product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall

• investor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate including changes in earnings estimates or buysell recommendations by securities analysts and whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities analysts who follow us and 

• general financial domestic international economic and market conditions including overall fluctuations in the us equity markets which may experience extreme volatility that in some cases is unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies

  description of business segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information managementbased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and improve producer efficiency which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our other operating segment combines and presents our products and services for the human medical diagnostics market “opti medical” with our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3 revenue recognition and note 17 segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

  our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

  cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro analyzer are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro analyzer are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

  diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as volume commitments such as our idexx 360 program or reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a multiyear customer commitment to purchase recurring products and services 

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers and vettest instruments through sales leases rental and other programs as of december 31 2020 our catalyst and vettest chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 59600 units globally as compared to approximately 56200 units in 2019 and approximately 50800 units in 2018 as of december 31 2020 our premium catalyst chemistry analyzers provided for an active installed base of approximatel y 49600 un its globally as compared to approximately 43900 units in 2019 and approximately 37000 units in 2018 a majority of our catalyst chemistry analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account has the highest economic value as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

we place our procyte dx lasercyte   dx and vetautoread hematology analyzers through multiple sales programs as well as of december 31 2020 these hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 41200 units as compared to 38200 units in 2019 and 35900 units in 2018 as of december 31 2020 our premium procyte dx and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers provided for an active installed base of approximately 34600 units globally as compared to approximately 31500 units in 2019 and approximately 29000 units in 2018  a majority of our procyte analyzer placements were made to new or competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts during 2020 we introduced and began selling our new procyte one analyzer and will begin delivery of these analyzers in 2021 as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte dx and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream 

as of december 31 2020 our premium sedivue dx analyzers provided for an active installed base of nearly10700 units globally as compared to approximately 8900 units in 2019 and approximately 6600 units in 2018 this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides a highly accurate way to automate the process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables 

  we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests including by providing the snap pro analyzer which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record our proread software interprets results of the snap pro analyzer these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro analyzer results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings acquiring new customers maintaining high customer loyalty and retention and realizing modest annual price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of diagnostics software integration with the ivls and vetconnect plus 

client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

  recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2020 recurri ng diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounted for approximately 78 of our consolidated revenue 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as demonstrated by peerreviewed thirdparty research as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro analyzer we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

we believe approximately half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in certain markets outside the us the prevalence of inclinic testing may vary and a greater or lesser percentage of diagnostic testing may be performed in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint new laboratories may operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally may have a negative effect on our operating margin 

recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers net of customer losses we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs and our volume commitment programs our upfront customer loyalty programs are associated with customer acquisitions and retention and provide incentives to customers in the form of cash 

payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear contractual agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services including reference laboratory services our volume commitment programs such as idexx 360 provide customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services 

  veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems  our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers within the north american australian and european markets cornerstone dvmax idexx animana and idexx neo practice management systems provide superior integrated information solutions backed by exceptional customer support and education these practice management systems allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we market cornerstone dvmax and idexx neo practice management systems to customers primarily in north america and australia we market our idexx animana offering to customers primarily throughout europe 

idexx animana and idexx neo practice management systems are subscriptionbased saas offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable recurring revenue stream while utilizing cloud technology instead of a client server platform while we continue to develop sell and support our licensedbased cornerstone and dvmax software we are growing our installed base of subscriptionbased practice management offerings for new customers of idexx practice management systems we believe that once established this subscriptionbased model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical licensebased placements our cornerstone and dvmax customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through enhanced diagnostic integrations and high value addon subscription services such as pet health network pro petly plans and credit card processing and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of all of our licensebased software offerings we also offer rvetlink a comprehensive referral management solution for specialty care hospitals that streamlines the referral process between primary care and specialty care veterinarians rvetlink’s cloud technology integrates with major specialty hospital management systems including cornerstone software and dvmax software 

we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and embedded integration with inclinic idexx vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication with our smartflow cloud technology we are able to improve overall patient management through coordination and tracking of every step in a patient workflow pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits 

our diagnostic imaging systems offer a convenient radiographic solution that provides superior image quality and the ability to share images with clients virtually anywhere idexx imaging software enables enhanced diagnostic features and streamlined integration with our other products and services our digital radiography systems enables lowdose radiation image capture without sacrificing clear highquality diagnostic images reducing the risk posed by excess radiation exposure for veterinary professionals placements of imaging systems are important to the growth of revenue streams that are recurring in nature including extended maintenance agreements and idexx web pacs which is our cloudbased saas offering for viewing accessing storing and sharing multimodality diagnostic images we derive relatively higher margins from our subscriptionbased products idexx web pacs is integrated with cornerstone idexx neo and idexx vetconnect plus to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device 

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices including drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

livestock poultry and dairy 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease reproductive and herd health and production management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate 

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business which also leverages the snap platform the dairy snap products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in dairy processors and develop product line enhancements and extensions our rapid visual pregnancy test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding this test provides a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples 

other 

  opti medical  our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

during 2020 we introduced the opti sarscov2 rtpcr test kit for covid19 testing a significant portion of the growth in our opti medical business was from revenue generated from the test kits and related laboratory services the future demand for this product is difficult to project given the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic including shortterm project commitments available pcr testing capacity alternative suppliers and the potential impact of vaccinations and other treatments 

our facility in roswell georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte needs of the veterinary market we leverage this facility’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

effective january 1 2020 we modified our management reporting to the chief operating decision maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including costs that were previously not allocated to our segments prior to january 1 2020 certain costs were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” these costs included costs primarily consisting of our rd function regional or country expenses and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation were charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates beginning january 1 2020 the segments will reflect these actual costs allocated to the segment based on various allocation methods including revenue and headcount foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported within our other reporting segment these management reporting changes did not have a material impact to our segment results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a description of the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3 revenue recognition to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

we enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of idexx products and services determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment we determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized we evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts 

we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation we utilize the observable standalone selling price when available which represents the price charged for the performance obligation when sold separately when standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including but not limited to the cost plus a margin approach 

our upfront loyalty programs provide customers with incentives in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement they are required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both upfront incentives to customers in the form of cash or idexx points are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as customer acquisition costs within other current and longterm assets which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases less upfront incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced other assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 15 million at december 31 2020 

our volume commitment programs such as our idexx 360 program provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract 

asset within other current and longterm assets the contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for future products and services over the term of the contract we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 31 million at december 31 2020 

our instrument rebate programs require an instrument purchase and provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the program we account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional we allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations including a customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases which is deferred and recognized upon the purchase of future products and services partly offsetting future rebates as they are earned we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 18 million at december 31 2020 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases customer rebates and other incentive payments and price adjustments related to multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition as described above 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when significant we typically utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be separately identified and recognized 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with intellectual property that has been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach that allows the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and instead proceeded directly to assessing the fair value of all of our reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value to determine if any impairment exists 

we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit to validate the reasonableness of our reporting units estimated fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our total market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

the results of our most recent goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units with a minimum of approximately 100 and an weighted average of approximately 1250 in total the majority of our goodwill is related to our cag diagnostics reporting units with an weighted average of approximately 1300 excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount including our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services rapid assay products and idexx vetlab consumables instruments services and accessories 

we also maintain approximately 46 million of goodwill associated with our veterinary software and services reporting unit which is primarily comprised of recent acquisitions of earlystage software companies that expand our suite of technology applications for the veterinary profession including saasbased practice management systems applications that extend workflow capabilities client marketing wellness plan management and other connectivity and communication needs these software applications continue to be in the earlier stages of commercial development and therefore our veterinary software and services reporting unit has a relatively lower excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount as indicated by the results of our most recent goodwill impairment test which indicated approximately 325 million and 350 of the reporting unit’s carrying value realization of this goodwill is dependent on our successful commercialization of these earlystage software applications 

additionally we maintain approximate ly 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical intellectual property outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 64 million and approximately 100 of t he reporting unit’s carrying value 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets other than goodwill based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the asset group is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows associated with the intangible asset are largely independent the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of the asset group exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate the amount of impairment for the year ended december 31 2020 was immaterial we had no impairments of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 260 million as of december 31 2020 and 297 million as of december 31 2019 which includes estimated interest expense and penalties see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 14 income taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

results of operations and trends 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

  market trends and covid19 pandemic impact  the primary impacts of the covid19 pandemic have been seen in our cag business while veterinary care is widely recognized as an “essential” service stayathome policies deployed to combat the spread of covid19 constrained visits to veterinary practices significantly in late march 2020 through early april 2020 pressuring diagnostic testing volumes restrictions on sales professionals’ access to veterinary clinics also contributed to deferrals on new cag instrument placements 

as stayathome policies were relaxed there was a sharp rebound in clinical visit activity which accelerated through the second quarter of 2020 and continued through the second half of 2020 weekly us companion animal practice data showed improvement in samestore clinical visits trends since midapril 2020 and solid cag market momentum has continued in early 2021 

companion animal market improvement trends globally have supported a strong recovery in demand for cag diagnostic products and services global cag diagnostics recurring revenues declined approximately 16 in april 2020 followed by increases of approximately 8 in may 2020 30 in june 2020 24 in july 2020 and approximately 20 for the remainder of the third and fourth quarter of 2020 

while these trends are encouraging potential effects related to ongoing covid19 case management efforts are challenging to predict and may pressure future revenues should enhanced social distancing policies and higher infection rates impact veterinary clinic operations in certain regions 

we have also seen impacts from the covid19 pandemic on water testing volumes there was some disruption to compliance water testing early in the second quarter of 2020 related to business lockdown effects as well as beach and pool closures which has since had a solid recovery approximately 20 of our water revenues are related to noncompliance testing which has seen declines related to reduced overall business activity and prioritization of laboratory spending we anticipate that neartomoderateterm demand for noncompliance testing will continue to be impacted by pandemic and related economic pressures 

in managing our businesses we continue to provide high levels of service delivery and product support for customers during this time and maintain high health and safety standards to protect our employees and ensure business continuity in an effort to continue to protect the health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities the majority of our employees continue to work remotely and travel remains highly restricted we have introduced new employee benefits to support remote workers 

  human covid19 testing  on may 7 2020 we announced that opti medical was granted by the united states food and drug administration fda an emergency use authorization eua for the opti sarscov2 rtpcr laboratory test kit for the detection of sarscov2 the virus that causes covid19 on june 5 2020 opti medical announced that it has received the ce mark certification in the european union for its opti sarscov2 rtpcr laboratory test kit additionally the fda has granted eua for the new opti dnarna magnetic bead kit for nucleic acid extraction from respiratory samples to be used with the opti sarscov2 rtpcr test kit which enables opti medical systems to provide laboratories with a complete opti medical systemsmanufactured workflow solution for covid19 testing we also provide human covid19 testing laboratories services to the maine center for disease control and prevention in support of their covid19 testing program these products and services are included within our opti medical business in our other segment and are the primary driver of growth in that segment 

  distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if 

during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

in certain countries we sell our products through thirdparty distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates see “part i item 1 business marketing and distribution” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding distribution channels 

  currency impact  for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 21 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 22 for both years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see “part i item 1a risk factors” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts 

  effects of economic conditions  pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services 

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

  effects of patent expiration  although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties tha t expired during 2020 and several that are expected to expire in 2021 and beyond the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as de scribed in part i item 1 business patents and licenses” 

  nongaap financial measures  the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth” organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates certain business acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

we exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period 

we also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends we consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs processes and outputs are present consistent with asu 201701 “ business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business ” in a business combination if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets we do not consider these assets to be a business a typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business such as employees or infrastructure we believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth 

we also use adjusted ebitda gross debt net debt gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio all of which are nongaap financial measures that should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for financial measures presented according to us gaap management believes that reporting these nongaap financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility 

  ceo transition  in the fourth quarter of 2019 jonathan jay mazelsky was appointed our president and chief executive officer while jonathan w ayers our former chairman of the board president and chief executive officer stepped down as chairman of the board ceased to be an employee of the company and transitioned to the role of external senior advisor to the company and a director on our board in connection with the foregoing mr ayers and idexx entered into a mutual separation agreement that provided for severance payments in accordance with the terms of his preexisting employment agreement and modified his outstanding stock options as a result we recognized a charge to operating income of approximately 134 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 representing the cost of the severance and an acceleration of the cost of the equity awards which was partially offset by a reduction to our provision for income taxes of approximately 12 million resulting in a total charge to net income of approximately 122 million net of tax impacts

total company 

the following table presents revenue by operating segment by us markets and nonus or international markets 



1 reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding 

  total company revenue  in our cag business we experienced significant pressure on testing volumes in the first half of the year specifically in latemarch through midapril related to covid19 social distancing procedures and guidelines we then experienced a sharp recovery in market demand for companion animal diagnostics globally including high levels of growth in testing volumes beginning in june 2020 through the fourth quarter supported by pentup demand for wellness and nonwellness testing as social distancing procedures and guidelines were eased during the third quarter as well as higher clinical visits related to new patients in our lpd business the increased demand for swine testing in china was partially offset by lower herd health screening revenue lower revenues in our water business are primarily the result of the covid19 pandemic due to lower demand for noncompliance testing the impact of currency movements on revenue was immaterial 

the following table presents our total company results of operations 



  gross profit  gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes and a 130 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in the gross profit margin was driven by several factors including the mix benefit from strong idexx vetlab consumable and lower cag diagnostics instrument revenue productivity and volume leverage in our reference laboratories the net benefit of price increases as well as the benefit from opti covid19 pcr testing lower product costs from volume leverage in our lpd segment also contributed favorably to our gross profit margin these favorable factors were offset by the incremental investments in reference laboratory capacity and systems including acquisitions the impact from foreign currency movements decreased the gross profit margin by approximatel y 40 basis points including the impact of hedge gains in the current year as compared to higher hedge gains in the prior year 

  operating expenses  the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs related to our expanded global commercial infrastructure partially offset by cost containment efforts implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including travel restrictions and temporary compensation and benefit reductions the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter and a charitable donation as well as increases in bad debt reserves and higher facilities costs these increases were partially offset by the absence of ceo separation costs incurred in the prior year as well as temporary cost containment efforts and prudent expense management across our business segments the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs as well as new product development costs partially offset by temporary cost containment efforts the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses by less than 1   

companion animal group   

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 



1 reported revenue growth and organic revenue growth may not recalculate due to rounding 

  cag diagnostics recurring revenue  during the first half of the year we experienced significant pressure on testing volumes specifically in latemarch through midapril related to covid19 social distancing procedures and guidelines we then experienced a sharp recovery in market demand for companion animal diagnostics globally including high levels of growth in testing volumes beginning in june 2020 through the fourth quarter supported by pentup demand for wellness and nonwellness testing as social distancing procedures and guidelines were eased during the third quarter as well as higher clinical visits related to new patients the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to increased volumes in idexx vetlab consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic services and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

the increase in idexx vetlab   consumables revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes for our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables these increases were supported by an expansion of our instruments installed base growth in testing by new and existing customers our expanded menu of available tests and to a lesser extent benefits from higher average unit sales prices 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher snap 4dx plus and feline triple sales volumes as well as higher realized prices rapid assay testing is relatively more dependent on wellness visits which were impacted more severely by covid19 stayathome policies and procedures specifically in the second quarter of 2020 however we saw a sharp rebound in rapid assay testing volumes in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 consistent with a broader us market recovery for wellness and nonwellness testing 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes most prominently in the us as well as higher average unit sales prices sales growth internationally was driven by strong growth in europe canada australia and japan acquisitions increased revenue by 14 

cag diagnos tic serv ices and accessories revenue grow th was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

  cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue  the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instrument revenue was primarily due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic including restrictions on our sales professionals access to clinics and certain customers deferring new purchase decisions 

  veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue  the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased veterinary software and diagnostic imaging subscriptionbased services due to the increases in our active installed base and to a lesser extent higher realized prices on these service offerings these factors were partially offset by impacts of the covid19 pandemic on new diagnostic imaging placements including restrictions on our sales professionals’ access to clinics and certain customers deferring purchase decisions which began to occur in midmarch of 2020 

the following table presents the cag segment results of operations 



  gross profit  gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volumes as well as a 140 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to productivity and volume leverage gains in our reference laboratories and the mix benefits from higher growth in idexx vetlab consumable revenue and lower cag diagnostics instrument revenue as well as the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio these favorable factors were partially offset by incremental investments in reference laboratory capacity and systems including acquisitions the impact from foreign currency movements decreased the gross profit margin by approximatel y 25 basis points including the impact of lower hedge gains in the current year compared to higher hedge gains in the prior year 

  operating expenses  the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs related to our global commercial infrastructure partially offset by our cost containment efforts implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including travel restrictions and temporary compensation and benefit reductions the increased in general and administrative was primarily due to an accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter and a charitable donation as well as bad debt and higher facilities costs partially offset by the absence of ceo separation costs incurred in the prior year as well as temporary cost containment efforts and prudent expense management across our business segments the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs partially offset by temporary cost containment initiatives the impact of currency movements on expenses were immaterial 

water 

the following table presents the water segment results of operations 



  revenue  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic primarily from reductions in noncompliance testing in the last three quarters of 2020 partially offset by higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli testing during the first quarter of 2020 as well as the benefit of price increases the impact of currency movements decreased revenue by approximate ly 16 

  gross profit  gross profit for water decreased due to lower sales volumes as well as a 190 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin primarily due to a 140 bas is point reduction from foreign currency movements including the impact of lower hedge gains in the current year compared the higher gains in the prior year as well as higher distribution and freight costs and higher product costs these reductions in the gross profit margin were partially offset by the net benefits of price increases 

  operating expenses  overall operating expenses were lower primarily as a result of cost containment efforts implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary compensation and benefit reductions and travel restrictions the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 15 

livestock poultry and dairy 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 



  revenue  the increase in lpd revenue was primarily due to the continued demand for swine testing in china to support the rebuilding of swine herds following the african swine fever outbreak these increases were offset by decreased herd health screening which reflects comparisons to a strong prior year and lower imports into china the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements decreased revenue 11 

  gross profit  the increase in lpd gross profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and a 200 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in the gross profit margin is primarily due to favorable product costs from volume leverage offset by the impact from foreign currency movements which decreased gross profit margin by approximately 180 basis points including the impact of lower hedge gains in the current year compared to higher gains in the prior year 

  operating expenses  overall operating expenses were lower primarily as a result of cost containment efforts implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic including temporary compensation and benefit reductions and travel restrictions sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses decreased primarily from reduced travel and personnelrelated costs partially offset by higher bad debt reserves and an impairment of an intangible asset associated with our food safety and dairy business the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to leveraging lpd personnel to support our human covid19 testing initiative and lower project costs partially offset by increased thirdparty development costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 15 

other 

the following table presents the other results of operations 



  revenue  the increase in other revenue was primarily due to our new opti covid19 pcr testing products and services which were introduced in the second quarter of 2020 the future demand for this product is difficult to project given the uncertain nature of the covid19 pandemic including shortterm project commitments available pcr testing capacity alternative suppliers and the potential impact of vaccinations and other treatments the impact of currency movements on revenue was immaterial 

  gross profit  the increase in gross profit was primarily due to sales volumes of our new opti covid19 pcr testing products and laboratory services the gross profit margin increased 1550 basis points primarily due to favorable product mix from opti covid19 pcr testing and to a lesser extent the net benefit of price increases in our core opti products partially offset by higher product costs in our other opti products the overall change in currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on gross profit 

  operating expenses    the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs associated with our new opti covid19 pcr testing initiative the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions as compared to the prior year for all operating segments which are reported within our other segment partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our covid19 pcr testing the increase in research and development cost was primarily due to higher personnelrelated and project costs associated with the development of the opti covid19 pcr test 

nonoperating items 

  interest expense  interest expense was 331 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 311 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense was primarily due to lower capitalized interest related compared to prior year as the expansion of our westbrook maine headquarters and relocation of our core reference laboratory in germany was completed in 2020 

  provisions for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 121 for the year ended december 31 2020 and 181 for the year ended december 31 2019 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 was lower primarily due to the onetime positive impact related to the enactment of tax reform in switzerland due to recording a deferred tax asset related to the transitional benefits as well as higher tax benefits related to sharebased compensation 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations proceeds from longterm senior note financings and amounts available under our credit facility we generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our diagnostic products and services consulting services and other various systems and services provided to the animal veterinary livestock poultry dairy and water testing markets our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees inventory and supplies taxes research and development capital expenditures rents occupancyrelated charges interest expense and acquisitions at december 31 2020 we had 3839 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 903 million on december 31 2019 working capital including our credit facility totaled 4800 million at december 31 2020 as compared to negative 457 million at december 31 2019 additionally at december 31 2020 we had remaining borrowing availability of 9986 million under our 1 billion credit facility which was expanded in april 2020 from 850 million and extended through april 2023 also in april 2020 we further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility by issuing 200 million in 10year 250 fixedrate senior notes we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future we may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to raise capital in the us through the incurrence of debt or equity issuances which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all in addition these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

the following table presents cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries 



of the 3839 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2020 greater than 99 was held as bank deposits of the 903 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2019 greater than 99 was held as bank deposits 

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital

2 inventory turns represent inventoryrelated cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarterend divided by the average inventory balances at the beginning and end of each quarter 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents cash provided used 



  operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 1889 million during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by a decrease in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities the decrease in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher deferred tax benefits related to the enactment of tax reform in switzerland in the current year and a decrease in sharebased compensation expense related to ceo transition costs in the prior year offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses primarily related to the completion of our major facilities projects early in 2020 

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities 



cash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year decreased approximately 732 million the change in other assets and liabilities was due to higher accrued liabilities including an accrued charge related to an ongoing litigation matter higher accrued personnelrelated costs related to higher incentives and delayed employer payroll taxes under the covid19 stimulus guidance as well as lower investments in customer volume commitment programs to support instrument placements additionally lower increases in inventory as compared to the prior year due to demand levels contributed to lower cash used compared to the same period in the prior year these factors were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable related to high levels of revenue growth 

we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned 

  investing activities    cash used by investing activities was 1094 million during 2020 as compared to 2055 million used during 2019 the decrease in cash used by investing activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the completion of our longterm major facilities projects during 2020 and less cash used for acquisition compared to the prior year these decreases in cash used were partially offset by the purchase of one of our reference laboratory facilities that was previously leased 

our total capital expenditure plan for 2021 is estimated to be approximately 120 million to 140 million which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory buildings and equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure 

financing activities  cash used by financing activities was 2484 million during 2020 as compared to 2864 million used during 2019 the decrease in cash used by financing activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was due the decrease in repurchases of our common stock and the issuance of senior notes partially offset by the increase in repayments on our credit facility 

  cash used to repurchase shares of our common s tock decreased by 1188 million during 2020  as compared to 2019 from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2020 we have repurchased 667 million shares for 43 billion during 2020 we purchased 07 million shares for an aggregate cost of 1796 million as compared to purchases of 122 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3038 million during 2019 due to the uncertainty of the duration and magnitude of the covid19 pandemic and its impacts during 2020 we suspended our open market share repurchase activity beginning in the first quarter of 2020 the existing share repurchase program continues to be authorized by our board of directors and we have resumed share repurchases during the first quarter of 2021 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 20 repurchases of common stock to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

the 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility matures on april 14 2023 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based on the prevailing libor canadian dollar rate or euribor but not less than 10 plus a credit spread ranging from 1375 to 200 based on our gross leverage ratio the credit facility also allows for borrowings based on the prevailing prime rate but not less than 200 plus a credit spread from 0375 to 100 under the credit facility we also pay quarterly commitment fees ranging from 02 to 0375 based on our leverage ratio on any unused commitment 

under the credit facility the net repayment and borrowing activity resulted in increased cash used of 1794 million during 2020 as compared to 2019 at december 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2019 we had 2888 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 14 million for letters of credit that were issued in connection with claims under our workers compensation policy at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa the failure to pay specified indebtedness crossacceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default

  effect of currency translation on cash  the net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries these changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change a currency’s value depends on many factors including interest rates and the country’s debt levels and strength of economy 

  offbalance sheet arrangements  we have no offbalance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and thirdparty guarantees as reflected in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13 debt and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 16 commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included in this annual report on form 10k respectively

for more information on our future lease payments see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 8 leases for our minimum lease payment schedule the expected timing of payments of our leases may be different in future years depending on decisions to extend lease terms andor enter into additional leases in the preceding years 

for more information on our repayment of our senior notes see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13 debt 

we also have purchase obligations that including agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are contractually enforceable and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities pricing and approximate timing of purchases as of december 31 2020 we have 2356 million in purchase obligations due in 2021 our purchase obligations beyond 2021 are approximately 859 million expected timing of payments of our purchase obligations is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

additionally we have agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2020 and 2019 and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees 

as of december 31 2020 our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 is 232 million which is expected to be paid in installments through 2025 for information on our unrecognized tax benefits see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 14 income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2020 approximatel y 21 o f our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 22 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency except four of our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the us dollar 

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2021 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 11 million and operating income by approximately 55 million additionally we project our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of december 31 2020 would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 2 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate the effect of a weaker us dollar will have a favorable effect on our operating results by increasing our revenues by 15 to 20 and increasing our diluted earnings per share by approximately 014 for the year ending december 31 2021 this favorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to decrease total company operating profit by approximately 8 million and diluted earnings per share by 007 during the year ending december 31 2021 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 119 the british pound at 134 the canadian dollar at 077 and the australian dollar at 076 and the japanese yen at ¥105 the chinese renminbi at rmb 657 and the brazilian real at r536 to the us dollar for the full year of 2021 

the following table presents the estimated foreign currency exchange impact on our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the current period and as compared to the respective prioryear period 



the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 hedging instruments to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2020 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we target to hedge approximately 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar we will continue to assess the reasonableness of increasing our hedge exposure to our longterm level during 2021 we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 2027 million at december 31 2020 and 2109 million at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 we had 121 million of net unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of related tax for more information on our hedge agreements see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 hedging instruments 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on april 14 2023 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until april 14 2023 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days at december 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31 2020 based on our gross leverage ratio our borrowing costs under the credit facility would have been approximately 25

blood and urine chemistry  we have three blood and urine chemistry analyzers that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions we currently sell two of these chemistry analyzers the catalyst one chemistry analyzer and the vettest chemistry analyzer we continue to support our catalyst dx   chemistry analyzer previously sold as part of the catalyst platform these three instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” based on ortho’s dry slide technology in addition the catalyst analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by idexx at our roswell georgia facility as well as certain slides that are manufactured at our westbrook maine facility blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin calcium creatinine blood urea nitrogen total protein and many others tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels called clips all three analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the detection of renal disease 

the catalyst analyzers provide significantly improved throughput ease of use and test menu relative to the vettest analyzer our original chemistry analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes phenobarbital fructosamine total thyroxine “t 4 ” creactive protein and sdma as part of one run key easeofuse features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system these analyzers also enable automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum and urine the catalyst sdma test allows our customers to use the catalyst one and catalyst dx analyzers to screen for sdma an innovative proprietary test that detects the onset of canine and feline kidney disease months or years earlier than traditional methods the catalyst sdma test is also available in a combo kit with t 4  

the catalyst one analyzer is engineered to deliver the same laboratoryquality results and realtime work flow as the catalyst dx analyzer the catalyst one analyzer currently offers all the same tests as the catalyst dx including an expanded menu of 33 tests 

we also have two other chemistry analyzers the vetlyte electrolyte analyzer and the vetstat electrolyte and blood gas analyzer the vetstat analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that are manufactured by idexx at our roswell georgia facility 

sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of idexx vetlab instruments 

hematology  we sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also called a complete blood count these analyzers include the procyte dx hematology analyzer the first and only inclinic analyzer to combine laserflow cytometry optical fluorescence and laminarflow impedance in its analysis the lasercyte dx hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry technology in their analysis and the idexx vetautoread hematology analyzer our original hematology analyzer in addition the procyte dx   hematology analyzer the lasercyte dx hematology analyzer and the lasercyte hematology analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids we also sell the coag dx analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders 

  

the procyte dx   analyzer our premier hematology analyzer provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the lasercyte lasercyte dx and vetautoread hematology analyzers the procyte dx analyzer provides up to 27 different blood parameters including the ability to detect band neutrophils nucleated red blood cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin for a more complete picture of a patient’s health the procyte dx is validated for 

many animal species canine feline equine bovine ferret rabbit gerbil pig guinea pig mini pig llama alpaca camel sheep goat dolphin and hamster the lasercyte and lasercyte dx analyzers are the only other point of care hematology analyzers in the veterinary market able to report absolute reticulocyte counts 

immunoassay testing instruments  our snap pro analyzer which automatically activates a snap test properly times the run and captures an image of the result this device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results with the pet owner on the snap pro analyzer screen or via vetconnect plus in addition the snap pro analyzer improves staff efficiency and ensures that all snap test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing proread is a software upgrade that enables the snap pro analyzer to interpret the test results 

with multiplepatient testing functionality the snapshot dx analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total t 4  cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function respectively the snapshot dx analyzer also reads interprets and records the results of many idexx rapid assay snap tests including our canine snap   4dx plus test   feline snap fivfelv combo test canine snap   cpl test feline snap   fpl test and canine snap   heartworm rt test 

urinalysis  the sedivue dx analyzer is designed to provide automated realtime results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis the sedivue dx analyzer brings automation speed and consistency to urinalysis a traditionally laborious and variable process its leadingedge technology allows veterinary staff to perform a urine sediment analysis in approximately 3 minutes the sedivue dx analyzer uses proprietary image processing algorithms similar to facial recognition technology to identify clinically relevant particles found in urine and to capture highcontrast digital images that become part of the permanent patient record the sedivue dx analyzer leverages its algorithmic software and machinelearning a type of artificial intelligence to better identify abnormalities with each result generated which we refer to as neural network 40 the idexx vetlab ua analyzer provides rapid automated capture of semiquantitative chemical urinalysis from idexx ua strips and is validated specifically for veterinary use 

idexx vetlab station  the idexx vetlab station “ivls” connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the idexx vetlab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability ivls securely connects to the internet and in this way enables idexx to perform through its smartservice solutions wireless services remote instrument service and software updates to ivls and certain connected instruments ivls also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to vetconnect plus we sell ivls as an integral component of the catalyst one catalyst dx lasercyte lasercyte dx and procyte dx   analyzers snap pro analyzer snapshot dx analyzer and also as a standalone hardware platform the ivls includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers ivls also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the idexx vetlab suite stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap test results and sends and receives information from practice management systems including the cornerstone system as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems 

the snap rapid assays are singleuse handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation although many kits may also be read and recorded automatically by the snapshot dx analyzer or activated and captured automatically by the snap pro analyzer and interpreted using proread as discussed above the principal snap rapid assay tests are as follows 

singleuse canine tests

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the us outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide generally through our direct sales force we market our diagnostic imaging products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada we market our software products primarily through our direct sales force in the us canada europe and australia we market our water and lpd products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through selected independent distributors we sell our opti electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti products primarily through distributors and other resellers 

research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business segments our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and external consulting and development costs were 1332 million for the year ended december 31 2019  or 55  of our consolidated revenue 1179 million for the year ended december 31 2018  or 53  of our consolidated revenue and 1092 million for the year ended december 31 2017  or 55 of our consolidated revenue 

patents and licenses 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the company based on a variety of factors including providing protection for the company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property affording protection from competitors in certain markets enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings strengthening our reputation and standing among customers employees and key suppliers and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters imitators and other copiers of technologies 

important patents and licenses include 

 

in addition we have pending us patent applications concerning reagents and methods for detecting sdma if such applications are granted we expect the associated patents would have expirations ranging from 2036 to 2038 

while we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to us a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position these factors include publications including peerreviewed thirdparty studies that demonstrate the accuracy of our products our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force our online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of including establishing automatic reorder schedules for our consumables tests and other products by our customers the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product offerings that often are patentable and that expand the test menu for our inclinic instruments andor reference laboratory business and our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2019 and are expected to expire in 2020 and beyond the expiration of these patents individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations in addition we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties we rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us and our direct suppliers with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers from time to time we seek to qualify alternative suppliers 

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include certain catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine t4 crp and sdma slides progesterone vetlyte consumables lasercyte and lasercyte dx consumables vettest vetautoread and procyte dx analyzers and consumables sedivue dx urinalysis instrument and consumables and components of our snap pro mobile device 

vettest and certain catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in december of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest   and catalyst chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market excluding the eu other than to idexx 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2034 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain diagnostic imaging systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

we do not generally maintain a significant backlog of orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we compete with many companies ranging from large human and animal health pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us as well as greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do for more information on risks related to our competition see “part i item 1a risk factors 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 



 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals product registrations manufacturing import export distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage product disposal environmental compliance and workplace safety the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

veterinary diagnostic products  these products include our diagnostic test kits for companion and food animal infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products these products are licensed and regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in and from the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product validation data including manufacturing process and facility documentation following regulatory licensure to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for test review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval to support product registration for sale distribution and use within their countries however compliance with extensive countryspecific regulatory processes is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in japan germany canada brazil the netherlands china and many other countries we are also required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine which also covers our distribution center in memphis tennessee our lpd manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 

our veterinary diagnostic slide and instrument systems including t4 fructosamine progesterone crp and sdma are veterinary medical devices regulated by the fda under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” other fda regulated products include our nonlicensed rapid assay products such as snap pancreatic lipase cortisol bile acid foal igg and probnp while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” the fdc act specifies that these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various 

regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class i andor class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

other environmental regulations  all idexx products must comply with applicable global product regulations including those governing consumer product safety and materials requirements such as the europeans unions electromagnetic compatibility emc directive the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances reach the restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive these complex regulatory requirements create risk to idexx’s ability to market and sell our products our business and our financial performance for more information about the risks associated with various us and foreign government regulation see various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business  under part i item 1a risk factors 

in the european union our analyzers and certain associated equipment are subject to the requirements of the rohs directive which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment other countries including china russia the united arab emirates and turkey have implemented or anticipate implementing regulatory regimes similar to the rohs directive our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the european medical device directive or the in vitro diagnostic directive which are both strictly applicable to human use products however these systems are required to meet ce certification which required compliance with the rohs directive the emc directive and other safety requirements similar requirements are specified by most counties in which we sell our products and are subject to increasing harmonization globally 

the european union was among the first to regulate and restrict the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products these requirements include the biocidal products regulation which requires the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being exported to the european union and reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that have been or may be adopted elsewhere such as turkey korea and other countries may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products some of our products including some of our companion animal products may be subject to pending restriction of microplastics pursuant to reach 

  

in the us the epa regulates chemical use similarly to the eu in addition certain states have their own chemical regulations such as californias proposition 65 which requires businesses to provide warnings to california residents about significant risk of exposures to chemicals in products that are known to cause cancer birth defects or other reproductive harm 

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and we are also subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act import and export laws and regulations including us import and export control and sanctions laws and laws and regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data development or acquisition of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company and our business our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form 10k factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

risks related to our business 

because our business lines are highly attractive they are also highly competitive our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability 

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants given our performance and the market’s strong growth and returns our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 



if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

we depend on key leadership and talent to succeed and compete effectively 

our continued success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract develop and retain highly capable and skilled senior leadership and other key personnel as we continue to grow our business expand our geographic scope and develop and offer innovative new products and services we require the organizational talent necessary to ensure effective succession for our senior leadership and other key personnel competition for experienced leaders and employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location work environment and development opportunities the loss of the services of or our failure to recruit or develop and implement effective succession plans for our senior leadership or other key personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success in addition even if we effectively develop and implement succession plans and make key leadership transitions we cannot provide assurances as to whether we may experience management or other challenges in connection with any of those leadership transitions that could adversely affect our future success 

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components for our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with such suppliers on reasonable terms breach or termination by suppliers of their contractual obligations inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities disruption to suppliers’ business including work stoppages suppliers’ failure to comply with complex and changing regulations and thirdparty financial failure any problems with our suppliers and associated disruptions to our supply chain could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability disruption to our supply chain could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations trade protection measures tariffs duties importexport restrictions quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics or the prospect of a pandemic climate changerelated events civil unrest war terrorism or other geopolitical developments including the united kingdom’s exit from the european union computer viruses physical or electronic breaches or other information system disruptions or security breaches and disruptions in utility and other services for more information regarding the risks presented by natural and other disasters and system disruptions and security breaches from cyberattacks see “we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business” and natural and other disasters could adversely affect our business below 

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology and vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer and consumables image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products even where products and materials are available from alternative suppliers if any become unavailable to us for any reason we likely would incur additional costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all in certain cases we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely 

we seek to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers on a riskprioritized basis and in a variety of ways including when possible by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers developing applicable inhouse manufacturing capabilities and expertise and entering into escrow arrangements for manufacturing information for certain 

single or solesourced products we also seek to enter into longterm contracts with our sole and single source suppliers that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable or fixed prices however there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement any of these mitigating activities or that if implemented any of them will be effective in preventing any delay or other disruption in our ability to supply the market in addition suppliers may decline to enter into longterm contracts for any number of reasons which would require us to purchase products via shortterm contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have longterm contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have longterm contracts will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers or if such sole and single source suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products either of which could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and a disruption of these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business  

we rely on several information systems throughout our company as well as our thirdparty business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems to provide access to our webbased products and services keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions although we maintain information security policies and employ system backup measures and engage in information system redundancy planning and processes such policies measures planning and processes as well as our current disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems and our business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including among other things computer viruses and malware denial of service actions misappropriation of data and similar events through the internet including via devices and applications connected to the internet and through email attachments and persons with access to these information systems such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business as information systems and the use of software and related applications by us our business partners suppliers and customers become more cloudbased and connected to the “internet of things” which is inherently susceptible to cyberattacks there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats including more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of data and information we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” such as our connected devices eg idexx vetlab instruments any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen while we have implemented network security and internal control measures especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption attack or security breach and as such the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains 

we and some of our third party vendors have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience further attacks in the future potentially with more frequency to our knowledge most of these attacks have been unsuccessful and none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations we have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats however given the unpredictability of the timing nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats which vary in technique and sources if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions or our customers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services we could potentially be subject to production downtimes operational delays other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information destruction or corruption of data security breaches other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks financial losses and additional costs from remedial actions repairs to infrastructure physical systems or data processing systems increased cybersecurity and information technology protection costs loss of business or potential liability andor damage to our reputation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition our customers could also face negative consequences such as the compromises of sensitive or critical information or systems furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of data or information including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services damage our ability to develop and protect our rights to our proprietary technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects for more information regarding data and information privacy and protection risks see “our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection” below 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 38  of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including but not limited to disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building staffing and managing foreign operations including a geographically dispersed workforce differing protection of intellectual property trade protection measures quotas embargoes importexport restrictions tariffs duties and regulatory and licensing requirements natural and other disasters public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics or the prospect of a pandemic ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s regulatory economic or political conditions including as a result of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union other unfavorable geopolitical conditions security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

in addition to market and sell many of our products outside the us we are subject to product approval and registration requirements that often require us to provide confidential proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies there can be no assurance that the confidential proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies to comply with product approval and registration requirements may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen which could negatively affect our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success we also may forgo marketing and selling some of our products in certain foreign jurisdictions due to the risk of intellectual property theft which could negatively affect our ability to expand our international operations and business for more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services see our success is heavily dependent on our continued proprietary product and service innovation below 

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

  

various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

as a global business we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda and the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products as well as the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the manufacture import and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include the biocidal products regulation which requires approval for the use of certain biocides in our products prior to being manufactured used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union and the restriction of hazardous substancesrohs directive which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere including china and brazil may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact 

in addition some foreign governments require us to register our products before they can be distributed or sold and these product registration requirements which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes and provide confidential proprietary information about those products to foreign regulatory agencies there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations there can also be no assurance that confidential proprietary information provided to foreign regulatory agencies may not be accessed by unauthorized persons or otherwise stolen which could negatively impact our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our innovative products and our future success for more information about the risks related to the protection of our proprietary rights in our products and services see our success is heavily dependent on our continued proprietary product and service innovation below 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations governing as well as legal and political environments that vary broadly regarding among other things the importation and exportation of products our global business practices such as anticorruption antimoney laundering and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal regulatory and political requirements and environments differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future 

any failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or to adjust to changing legal and political environments could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation any of these could negatively impact our business 

our success is heavily dependent on our continued proprietary product and service innovation 

we believe our future success significantly depends on our ability to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing proprietary product and service offerings and to develop and introduce new and innovative proprietary products and services as a result we invest substantial funds and efforts into rd investigating new products and technologies being developed by third parties and obtaining certain such new products and technologies through licenses or acquisitions there can be no assurance that our rd licensing or acquisition efforts will achieve expected results when or whether any of our products or services now under development will be launched or whether we may be able to develop license or otherwise acquire new products or technologies we also cannot predict whether any product or service offering once launched will achieve market acceptance or achieve sales and revenue consistent with our expectations 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

increased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition will become even more intense as new products services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market in the united states and abroad include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories certain large and wellfunded animal health pharmaceutical companies as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as vca inc formerly named vca antech inc which is wholly owned by mars incorporated another operator of corporate hospital chains consolidation among our competitors and our customers may intensify the competition we face while we believe that our offerings are competitively differentiated due to our proprietary products and services such as the idexx sdma test and vetconnect plus that offer an integrated comprehensive diagnostic solution and the quality of our technical and customer service there can be no assurance that increased consolidation among our competitors or customers as well as any resulting reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers see “consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business” below 

competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of innovative new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new innovative and competitive products and services which could be superior or be perceived by our customers to be superior to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services business combinations and mergers among our competitors may result in competitors that are better positioned to create market and sell more compelling product and service offerings while an important aspect of our strategy is to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors’ products or services or otherwise achieve market acceptance some of 

our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services perceived in the eyes of customers as similar at substantially lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering certain of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us as well as greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the veterinary services industry in the us and abroad has been consolidating over time at an accelerating rate in recent years in the united states the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners pet partners and vca inc and national veterinary associates and are joined by dozens of smaller consolidators a similar trend exists in other regions such as canada europe australia new zealand brazil and china furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally attempt to shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence the outbreak of certain diseases such as african swine fever among livestock or poultry or the adverse impact of climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of such animals in the affected regions reducing herd or flock sizes which could reduce the demand for our testing products for such animals changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products in addition changes and trends in local dairy poultry or other food markets around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products declines in testing for any reason including the reasons described above along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

natural and other disasters could adversely affect our business 

our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors beyond our control such as natural disasters andor climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods public health issues such as outbreaks epidemics or the prospect of a pandemic civil unrest negative geopolitical conditions and developments and war terrorism or other manmade disasters any of these events could result in among other things damage to or the 

temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be costly and may require substantial leadtime to repair or replace damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our thirdparty business partners or suppliers on which we rely a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets an interruption in power supply a temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver or delays in the delivery of our products or services and short or longterm damage to our customers’ businesses which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services for more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers’ operations and supply chain see “our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results” above 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk tokyo japan and leipzig germany interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events we also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for potential longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our customers pet owners suppliers and employees we collect and use personal data in a variety of ways we offer products and services that collect and use personal data provided by customer practices individuals and thirdparties at customers direction including practice management systems for veterinary practices online customer communication tools and services vetconnect plus twoway integration technology and use by thirdparties authorized by our customers to provide programs and services to such customers some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various websites and collect contact and other personal data from our customers and visitors to our websites the privacy security retention sharing and use of the personal data described above are subject to expanding and increasingly complex laws and regulations in the us such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 and abroad such as the brazilian general data protection law “lgpd” which will become effective on august 15 2020 some of which impose significant compliance obligations some of these laws and regulations apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure sharing and security of personal data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time in many cases the federal state and international laws described above apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations for example we are subject to the european unions general data protection regulation or gdpr which became effective in may 2018 the gdpr imposes stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements and could subject us to increased liability for violations in addition the laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current global privacy policy and data protection practices the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit our ability to use and share personal data additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal data can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators in the us and abroad to expand or adopt more stringent regulations and laws 

while we have policies and procedures in place to comply with all applicable privacyrelated laws and regulations including the gdpr and ccpa as well as our contractual obligations any failure or perceived failure by us the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to so comply could result in damage to our reputation or legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others any of which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention disclosure or security of personal data or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could damage our reputation and harm our business 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

we are a global business with 38  of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2019  attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies 

for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 22  of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 22 and 21 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact in addition there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union especially between the us dollar and the british pound 

our foreign currency hedging activities see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18  hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 

we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals 

or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all   

we sell many products through distributors which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

some of our product sales in international markets occur through thirdparty distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels and changes in our distributors’ inventory levels as compared to comparable prior periods could negatively impact our revenue growth rates we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results while we maintain a rigorous distribution compliance program violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the nature of our international operations subjects us to local state regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation additionally tax rules governing crossborder activities are continually subject to modification as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted in the us on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us federal corporate tax system effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and transitioned from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system the 2017 tax act introduced new provisions including the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign derived intangible income “fdii” base erosion antiabuse tax “beat’ expanded bonus depreciation and changed deductions for executive compensation and interest expense the us department of treasury continues to issue regulations related to the 2017 tax act which may increase or decrease our tax liability in future periods see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13 income taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the 2017 tax act 

we have received a tax ruling from the netherlands that documents our mutual understanding of how existing tax laws apply to our circumstances this ruling expires as of december 31 2022 and we have been informed that it will not be renewed due to changes to the advance ruling policy in the netherlands while the absence of an advance agreement does not 

preclude our ability to continue to apply existing tax laws in the same manner as allowed by the existing ruling the lack of such agreement could create uncertainty as to our future tax rate 

additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may increase our cost of borrowing and limit our activities 

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates including rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor exposing us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations under our variablerate credit facility would increase even if the principal amount borrowed remained the same while we may enter into interest rate swaps in the future to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our variablerate indebtedness we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

in addition the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established if libor ceases to exist one or more interest rates under our credit facility would in the absence of an amendment instead apply depending on currency of the borrowing and other factors including the cost of funds of applicable lenders as determined by them and similarly we may need to amend certain of our other agreements that 

use libor as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected additionally uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance or modification of libor alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks 

  

risks related to an investment in our securities 

fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates timing of regulatory approvals and licenses litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid 

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as other general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance the following factors in addition to other factors described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this form 10k may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 

 in addition broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly furthermore the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that in some cases has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10‑k  the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31 2017 is included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 within item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated by reference herein 

we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form 10k in the  glossary of terms and selected abbreviations” 

description of business segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information managementbased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” with our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3  revenue recognition and note 16  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019  included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation and settlement gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are also captured within unallocated amounts 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro analyzer are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro analyzer are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as volume commitments such as our idexx 360 program or reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a multiyear customer commitment to purchase recurring products and services 

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2019  our catalyst and vettest chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 56200 units globally as compared to approximately 50800 units in 2018 and approximately 47000 units in 2017  as of december 31 2019  our premium catalyst chemistry analyzers provided for an active installed base of approximately 43900 units globally as compared to approximately 37000 units in 2018 and approximately 30000 units in 2017  a majority of our catalyst chemistry analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account has the highest economic value as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer 

as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

the procyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer in addition we sell the lasercyte   dx and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2019  these hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 38200 units as compared to 35900 units in 2018 and 33400 units in 2017  as of december 31 2019  our premium procyte dx and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers provided for an active installed base of approximately 31500 units globally as compared to approximately 29000 units in 2018 and approximately 26000 units in 2017  a majority of our procyte analyzer placements were made to new or competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte dx and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream 

our sedivue dx instrument was launched in north america early in 2016 and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of 2016 during 2017 we continued to launch sedivue dx internationally as of december 31 2019  our premium sedivue dx analyzers provided for an active installed base of nearly 8900 units globally as compared to approximately 6600 units in 2018 and approximately 4000 units in 2017  this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides a highly accurate way to automate the process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables this new payperrun consumable revenue stream is contributing to our continuing growth however is not currently material relative to idexx’s overall revenue 

we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests including by providing the snap pro analyzer which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record beginning in january of 2017 with our proread software the snap pro analyzer interprets results these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro analyzer results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings acquiring new customers maintaining high customer loyalty and retention our ability to realize modest annual price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of diagnostics software integration with the ivls and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2019  recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounted for approximately 76 of our consolidated revenue 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as demonstrated by peerreviewed thirdparty research as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro analyzer we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

we believe approximately half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in certain markets outside the us inclinic testing may be less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated 

expansion in our reference laboratory footprint new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin 

recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers net of customer losses we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs and our volume commitment programs our upfront customer loyalty programs are associated with customer acquisitions and retention and provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear contractual agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services including reference laboratory services our volume commitment programs such as idexx 360 provide customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services 

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri has allowed us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems  our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers within the north american australian and european markets cornerstone dvmax idexx animana and idexx neo practice management systems provide superior integrated information solutions backed by exceptional customer support and education these practice management systems allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we market cornerstone dvmax and idexx neo practice management systems to customers primarily in north america and australia we market our idexx animana offering to customers primarily throughout europe 

idexx animana and idexx neo practice management systems are subscriptionbased saas offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable recurring revenue stream while utilizing cloud technology instead of a client server platform while we continue to develop sell and support our licensedbased cornerstone and dvmax software we are growing our installed base of subscriptionbased practice management offerings for new customers of idexx practice management systems we believe that once established this subscriptionbased model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical licensebased placements our cornerstone and dvmax customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through enhanced diagnostic integrations and high value addon subscription services such as pet health network pro petly plans and credit card processing and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of all of our licensebased software offerings we also offer rvetlink a comprehensive referral management solution for specialty care hospitals that streamlines the referral process between primary care and specialty care veterinarians rvetlink’s cloud technology integrates with major specialty hospital management systems including cornerstone software and dvmax software

important to the growth of revenue streams that are recurring in nature including extended maintenance agreements and idexx web pacs which is our cloudbased saas offering for viewing accessing storing and sharing multimodality diagnostic images we derive relatively higher margins from our subscriptionbased products idexx web pacs is integrated with cornerstone idexx neo and idexx vetconnect plus to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device 

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices including drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

livestock poultry and dairy 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease reproductive and herd health and production management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate 

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business which also leverages the snap platform the dairy snap products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in dairy processors and develop product line enhancements and extensions our rapid visual pregnancy test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding this test provides a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples

opti medical  our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success 

in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

our facility in roswell georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte needs of the veterinary market we leverage this facility’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 2  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3  revenue recognition  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

we enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations where customers purchase a combination of idexx products and services determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment we determine the transaction price for a contract based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized we evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts 

we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation we utilize the observable standalone selling price when available which represents the price charged for the performance obligation when sold separately when standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including but not limited to the cost plus a margin approach 

our upfront loyalty programs provide customers with incentives in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement they are required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both upfront incentives to customers in the form of cash or idexx points are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as customer acquisition costs within other current and longterm assets which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases less upfront incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced other assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 16 million at december 31 2019  

our volume commitment programs such as our idexx 360 program provide customers with free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract 

asset within other current and longterm assets the contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for future products and services over the term of the contract we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 22 million at december 31 2019  

our instrument rebate programs previously referred to as idexx instrument marketing programs require an instrument purchase and provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the program we account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional we allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations including a customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases which is deferred and recognized upon the purchase of future products and services offsetting future rebates as they are earned we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 10 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 24 million at december 31 2019  

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases customer rebates and other incentive payments and price adjustments related to multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition as described above 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with intellectual property that has been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018  we elected to bypass the qualitative approach that allows the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and instead proceeded directly to assessing the fair value of all of our reporting units and comparing the fair value of to the carrying value to determine if any impairment is necessary 

we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit to validate the reasonableness of our reporting units estimated fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our total market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical intellectual property outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 47 million and 71 of the reporting unit’s carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units with a minimum of 217 and an average of approximately 1060 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets other than goodwill based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate 

we had no impairments of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

sharebased compensation 

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all our options granted during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 



 

changes in these subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2019  was 231 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 5 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2019  would have increased or decreased by approximately 33 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2019  for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by approximately 06 million 

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2019  would have increased or decreased by approximately 21 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2019  for options awarded during 2019 would have increased or decreased by approximately 04 million 

for a significant majority of our awards sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a gradevesting methodology for performancebased restricted stock units sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2019  was 393 million  which is net of a reduction of approximately 37 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation during the fourth quarter of 2019 we entered a mutual separation agreement with our former ceo pursuant to which his outstanding stock options were modified which resulted in 109 million of sharebased compensation expense in the quarter related to the acceleration and revaluation of his stock options there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2018 or 2017  

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued totaled 427 million for the year ended december 31 2019  340 million for the year ended december 31 2018  and 314 million for the year ended december 31 2017  the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2019  was 501 million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 17 years 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 297 million as of december 31 2019  and 260 million as of december 31 2018  which includes estimated interest expense and penalties see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

results of operations and trends 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

in certain countries we sell our products through thirdparty distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates see “part i item 1 business marketing and distribution” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding distribution channels 

currency impact  for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 22  of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 22 and 21 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see “part i item 1a risk factors” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts 

effects of economic conditions  pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services 

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

effects of patent expiration  although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2019 and several that are expected to expire in 2020 and beyond the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in part i item 1 business patents and licenses” 

nongaap financial measures  the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth” organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates certain business acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

we exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period 

we also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends we consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs processes and outputs are present consistent with asu 201701 “ business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business ” in a business combination if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets we do not consider these assets to be a business a typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business such as employees or infrastructure we believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth 

we also use adjusted ebitda gross debt net debt gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio all of which are nongaap financial measures that should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for financial measures presented according to us gaap management believes that reporting these nongaap financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility 

executive officers and directors  as reported previously effective october 23 2019 our board of directors our “board” appointed jonathan jay mazelsky as our president and chief executive officer and as a director of the company mr mazelsky had been serving as our interim president and chief executive officer since june 28 2019 prior to that time since august 2012 mr mazelsky had been an executive vice president of the company in addition effective november 1 2019 lawrence d kingsley a company director since october 2016 and lead independent director since may 2018 was appointed as independent nonexecutive chairman of our board also effective november 1 2019 jonathan w ayers our chairman and former president and chief executive officer who had been on a medical leave of absence since june 28 2019 stepped down as chairman of our board ceased to be an employee of the company and transitioned to the role of external senior advisor to the company mr ayers continues to serve as a member of our board while we cannot provide assurances as to whether we may experience management or other challenges in connection with our leadership transition that could adversely affect our future success we believe that under the leadership of mr mazelsky as president and chief executive officer and mr kingsley as independent nonexecutive chairman we will continue to successfully execute our strategy and create longterm value for shareholders customers and employees 

in connection with the foregoing mr ayers and idexx entered into a mutual separation agreement pursuant to which severance payments will be made to mr ayers in accordance with the terms of his preexisting employment agreement and his outstanding stock options were modified as a result of his severance payments and the modification of mr ayers’s outstanding stock options we recognized a charge to operating income of approximately 134 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 representing the cost of the severance and an acceleration of the cost of the equity awards which was offset by a reduction to our provision for income taxes of approximately 12 million resulting in a total charge to net income of approximately 122 

million net of tax impacts this total charge to net income is less than our previously communicated expectation of approximately 155 million as a result of finalizing our income tax provision 

comparisons to prior periods  our fiscal years end on december 31 unless otherwise stated the analysis and discussion of our financial condition results of operations and liquidity including references to growth and organic growth and increases and decreases are being compared to the equivalent prior year period 

twelve months ended december 31 2019  compared to twelve months ended december 31 2018 

total company 

the following table presents revenue by operating segment by us markets and nonus or international markets 



 

total company revenue  the increase in both us and international organic revenues was driven by strong volume gains in cag diagnostics recurring revenue supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies and expanded commercial organization that are driving increased volumes from new and existing customers in our reference laboratory business we also had high growth in consumable revenues supported by the impact of the continued expansion of our cag diagnostics instrument installed base globally our water business also contributed to our overall growth primarily from higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories our lpd business growth was primarily due to increased demand for african swine fever testing programs and diagnostic testing for alternative food sources including poultry which more than offset lower recurring swine testing in china as well as increased herd health screening the impact of currency movements decreased revenue by 18  

the following table presents our total company results of operations 



  

gross profit  the total company gross profit increase was due to higher sales volumes and a 60 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in the gross profit margin was driven by mix benefits from high growth in idexx vetlab consumable revenues volume leverage the favorable impact of lower product costs in our cag business as well as the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio and water business the impact from foreign currency movements increased the gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points including the impact of hedge gains in the current year as compared to hedge losses in the prior year 

operating expenses  sales and marketing expense increase d approximately 10 excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs as we continue to invest in and grow our global commercial infrastructure general and administrative expense increase d approximately 9 excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily from higher personnelrelated costs including costs associated with the separation agreement of our former ceo partially offset by the benefits of cost control initiatives across our business segments research and development expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs with an immaterial impact from foreign currency the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 2 including lower foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions recorded within unallocated amounts 

companion animal group   

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag ໿ 



 

cag diagnostics recurring revenue  the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to increased volumes in idexx vetlab consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic services and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

the increase in idexx vetlab   consumables revenue was primarily due to higher sales volumes across all regions for our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables these increases were supported by an expansion of our instruments installed base growth in testing by new and existing customers our expanded menu of available tests and to a lesser extent benefits from higher average unit sales prices 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher sales volumes across our snap product portfolio driven by snap ®   4dx plus tests and to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from new and existing customers supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies such as idexx sdma ™ and fecal antigen testing and to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue  the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instrument revenue reflects the impact of foreign currency movements which reduced revenues 20  excluding the impact of foreign currency movements our revenues increased slightly primarily due to higher catalyst and procyte instrument placements partially offset by product mix including lower sedivue dx placements compared to high prior year levels as well as the lower allocated revenue per unit on our idexx vetlab instruments related to increased international placements under our customer volume commitment programs 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue  the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased veterinary software and hardware upgrades subscriptionbased services as well as higher realized prices on these 

service offerings and to a lesser extent higher diagnostic imaging services as a result of the increase in our active installed base these increases were partially offset by lower allocated revenue per unit on our diagnostic imaging systems related to increased placements under volume commitment programs our acquisition of a software company in the second half of 2018 contributed 09 to reported revenue growth 

the following table presents the cag segment results of operations 



gross profit  gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volumes as well as a 60 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the increase in gross profit margin was driven by mix benefits from high growth in idexx vetlab consumable revenues volume leverage lower product costs as well as the benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio partially offset by incremental investments in reference laboratory capacity and software services field resources the impact from foreign currency movements increased the gross profit margin by approximately 10 basis points including the impact of hedge gains in the current year compared to hedge losses in the prior year 

operating expenses  sales and marketing expenses increase d approximately 11 excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs as we continue to invest in our global commercial infrastructure general and administrative costs increased 5 excluding the impact of foreign currency primarily from higher personnelrelated costs the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs with an immaterial impact from foreign currency the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 1 

water 

the following table presents the water segment results of operations 



revenue  the increase in revenue was attributable to the benefit of price increases and higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli testing including strong volume growth across all regions including the us the impact of currency movements decreased revenue by approximately 26  

gross profit  gross profit for water increased due to higher sales volumes as well as a 180 basis point increase in the gross profit margin foreign currency movements increased the gross profit margin by approximately 70 basis points including the impact of hedge gains in the current year as compared to hedge losses in the prior year the remaining increase in the gross profit margin was primarily due to the net benefit of price increases partially offset by higher distribution costs 

operating expenses  while both sales and marketing and research and development expenses had higher personnelrelated costs the limited increase in sales and marketing expense and significant increase in research and development expense were primarily due to the realignment of certain personnel within operating expense categories general and administrative expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 2 

livestock poultry and dairy 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 



  

revenue  overall lpd revenue increased despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements which decreased revenue 42  the prolonged outbreak of african swine fever in asia which began in august 2018 continues to negatively impact the swine population in china however demand for new diagnostic testing programs has increased and diagnostic testing for alternative food sources has also increased including poultry which more than offset the lower recurring swine testing volumes in china revenue growth for the year also benefited from increased herd health screening partially offset by lower bovine testing primarily in europe 

gross profit  the increase in lpd gross profit was due to higher sales volume and a 180 basis point increase in the gross profit margin the impact from foreign currency movements increased the gross profit margin by approximately 130 basis points including the impact of hedges the remaining increase in the gross profit margin was driven by favorable product mix from higher herd health screening 

operating expenses  sales and marketing expense decreased primarily due to lower personnelrelated costs including cost control initiatives general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower thirdparty services research and development expense increased primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in operating expense of approximately 2 

other 

the following table presents the other results of operations 



໿ 

revenue  the increase in other revenues was due to higher royalties associated with intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line partially offset by lower volumes of our opti medical products and services the impact of foreign currency movements on revenue was immaterial 

gross profit  gross profit for other decreased due to a 110 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin primarily due to higher opti medical service costs partially offset by lower product costs as well as mix benefits from increased royalties the overall change in currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on the gross profit margin 

operating expenses    the decrease in sales and marketing was primarily due to lower personnel costs the decrease in general and administrative cost was primarily due to the recovery of previously established bad debt reserves in africa and the middle east the increase in research and development cost was primarily due to higher personnelrelated and project costs 

unallocated amounts 

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

the following table presents the unallocated amounts results of operations 



unallocated amounts  the change in unallocated amou nts was primarily due to our ceo transition costs of 134 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and higher other unallocated employee incentive costs partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions lower unallocated employee benefit costs and lower unallocated corporate function and research and development costs 

nonoperating items 

interest income  interest income was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to 12 million for the same period in the prior year the decrease in interest income was primarily due to the liquidation of our portfolio of marketable securities during the first quarter of 2018 

interest expense  interest expense was 311 million for the year ended december 31 2019  as compared to 347 million for the prior year the decrease in interest expense was the result of lower average debt levels offset by higher interest rates we also realized lower interest expense from the benefit of our cross currency swaps as well as increased capitalized interest related to the expansion of our westbrook maine headquarters and relocation of our core reference laboratory in germany 

provisions for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 181 for the year ended december 31 2019  and 176 for the year ended december 31 2018  our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was higher primarily due to lower tax benefits related to sharebased compensation partially offset by a nonrecurring item recorded in the first quarter of 2018 that resulted from the 2017 tax cut and jobs act 

during the third quarter of 2019 the swiss government enacted changes to swiss federal tax laws and required all swiss cantons to make conforming changes to their own laws as the cantons consider how to implement the required changes through early 2020 we will continue assessing the impact if any of the canton’s adoption of swiss federal tax reform the impact of any such change will be recorded upon the date of cantons enactment 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was reduced by approximately 35 from the tax benefits related to sharebased payments we anticipate the tax benefit related to sharebased payments to reduce our 2020 effective income tax rate by approximately 15 based on recent settlement trends and stock price levels these impacts may vary significantly based on the timing of actual settlement activity 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility we generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our diagnostic products and services consulting services and other various systems and services provided to the animal veterinary livestock poultry dairy and water testing markets our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees inventory and supplies taxes research and development capital expenditures rents occupancyrelated charges interest expense and acquisitions at december 31 2019  we had 903 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 1238 million on december 31 2018  working capital including our credit facility totaled negative 457 million at december 31 2019  as compared to negative 1163 million at december 31 2018  additionally at december 31 2019  we had remaining borrowing availability of 5598 million under our 850 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

the 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us corporate tax system the 2017 tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective as of january 1 2018 and transitioned the us federal tax system from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system in converting to the new territorial tax system a deemed repatriation tax on previously taxdeferred earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries was required to be recognized as of december 31 2017 and will be payable over eight years we are no longer asserting indefinite reversal under asc 7403025 for undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries and have accrued for related tax liabilities as of december 31 2019  

the following table presents cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries 



of the 903 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2019  greater than 99 was held as bank deposits of the 1238 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2018  greater than 99 was held as bank deposits 

should we require more capital than is generated by our operations for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could raise capital through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in increased interest expense and dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital 



 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents cash provided used 



operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 591 million during 2019 as compared to 2018  was primarily due to the increase in net income net of noncash items offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 

  

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities 



cash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year increased approximately 133 million  the increase was primarily due to higher inventory levels to support greater demand additionally other assets increased due to higher instrument placements under our customer commitment programs which are offset by lower deferred revenue from placements under our instrument rebate programs as well as increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable due to growth and timing 

we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

investing activities    cash used by investing activities was 2055 million during 2019 as compared to 1386 million provided during 2018  the increase in cash used by investing activities during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to sale of marketable securities in 2018 as a result of our repatriation of cash and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries as well as increased capital spending in the current year as we expand our westbrook maine headquarters and relocate our core 

reference laboratory in germany during 2018 in connection with the passage of the 2017 tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017 we liquidated our marketable securities and used the cash to partially pay down our credit facility 

our total capital expenditure plan for 2020 is estimated to be approximately 140 million to 155 million which includes the completion of the expansion of our headquarters the relocation and expansion of our german core reference laboratory other capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory buildings and equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

financing activities  cash used by financing activities was 2864 million during 2019 as compared to 5978 million used during 2018  the decrease in cash used by financing activities during 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to a larger repayment on our revolving credit facility in 2018 from repatriated foreign cash an issuance of 100 million senior notes during the first quarter of 2019 and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock 

cash used to repurchase shares of our common s tock decreased by 677 million during 2019  as compared to 2018  from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2019  we have repurchased 660 million shares for 41 billion during 2019 we purchased 122 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3038 million as compared to purchases of 177 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3687 million during 2018  we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19  repurchases of common stock  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

the 850 million unsecured revolving credit facility matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 1375 percentage points above the libor or cdor based on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0375 based on our leverage ratio for more information regarding risk associated with interest rates based on libor see part i item 1a risk factors restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may increase our cost of borrowing and limit our activities  

under the credit facility the net repayment and borrowing activity resulted in less cash used of 1458 million during 2019 as compared to 2018  at december 31 2019  we had 2888 million outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2018  we had 3989 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 14 million and 13 million for letters of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers compensation policy at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa the failure to pay specified indebtedness crossacceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default 

on march 14 2019 we amended the multicurrency note purchase and private shelf agreement dated as of december 19 2014 among the company metropolitan life insurance company and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein and pursuant to such amended agreement we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of 100 million of unsecured senior notes at a 419 per annum rate due march 14 2029 the 2029 series c notes the 2029 series c notes proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

since december 2013 we have issued and sold through private placements unsecured senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of approximately 700 million including the 100 million 2029 series c notes pursuant to certain note purchase agreements collectively the “senior note agreements” the senior note agreements contain affirmative 

negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of our subsidiaries priority indebtedness fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 12  debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes 

should we elect to prepay the senior notes such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable makewhole amounts as defined within the applicable senior note agreements additionally in the event of a change in control of the company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the company the proceeds of which are not reinvested as defined in the senior note agreements we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes the obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable senior note agreement each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under erisa the failure to pay specified indebtedness and crossacceleration to specified indebtedness 

effect of currency translation on cash  the net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries these changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change a currency’s value depends on many factors including interest rates the country’s debt levels and strength of economy 

offbalance sheet arrangements  we have no offbalance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and thirdparty guarantees as reflected in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 12 debt  and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 15  commitments contingencies and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019  included in this annual report on form 10k respectively 

financial covenant  the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation as defined in the senior note agreements and credit facility not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreements the following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation

under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for us employees we retain claims liability risk per incident up to 1 million per year in 2019  2018  and 2017  we recognized us employee healthcare claim expense of 593 million  527 million  and 472 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively which represents actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of december 31 2019 and 2018  was approximately 50 million  

workers’ compensation and automobile claim expenses recognized during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 and our respective liability for such claims as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were not material for the years ended on or prior to december 31 2017 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of december 31 2019  as of december 31 2019  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 14 million to the insurance companies as security for the claims in connection with these policies 

  

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below 



 

these commitments do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 268 million and  17 million of deferred compensation liabilities as of december 31 2019  as the timing of recognition is uncertain see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2019 our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the tax act is 270 million which is expected to be paid in installments through 2025 

not reflected in the contractual obligation table above are agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2019 and 2018  and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 22  of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 22 for the year ended december 31 2018 and 21 for the year ended december 31 2017 the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for four of our foreign subsidiaries the functional currency is the us dollar 

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2020  excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 9 million and operating income by approximately 5 million additionally we project our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of december 31 2019  would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 2 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate the effect of a stronger us dollar will have an unfavorable effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2020  by approximately 11 million 10 million and 009 per share respectively this unfavorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to decrease total company operating profit by approximately 6 million and diluted earnings per share by 005 in the year ending december 31 2020  the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at  110  the british pound at  129  the canadian dollar at  076  and the australian dollar at  068  and the japanese yen at ¥ 110  the chinese renminbi at rmb 710  and the brazilian real at r 414 to the us dollar for the full year of 2020  

the following table presents the foreign currency exchange impacts on our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share as compared to the respective prior periods 



the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we 

immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18  hedging instruments  to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2019  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and in 2017 and prior the swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 2109 million at december 31 2019  and 1909 million at december 31 2018  at december 31 2019  we had 27 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of related tax 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 4 2020 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2019  were 2888 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 278  based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2019  an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 29 million on an annualized basis

inclinic diagnostic solutions 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our idexx vetlab suite of inclinic chemistry hematology immunoassay urinalysis and coagulation analyzers as well as associated proprietary consumable products that provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include a broad range of singleuse handheld idexx snap   rapid assay test kits that provide quick accurate and convenient pointofcare diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions 

the idexx vetlab suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products all of which are described below additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

blood and urine chemistry  we have three blood and urine chemistry analyzers that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions we currently sell two of these chemistry analyzers the catalyst one chemistry analyzer and the vettest chemistry analyzer we previously sold the other chemistry analyzer which is the catalyst dx   chemistry analyzer and continue to support that product as part of the catalyst platform these three instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” based on ortho’s dry slide technology in addition the catalyst analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by idexx at our roswell georgia facility as well as certain slides that are manufactured at our westbrook maine facility blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin calcium creatinine blood urea nitrogen total protein and many others tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels called clips all three analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the detection of renal disease 

the catalyst analyzers provide significantly improved throughput ease of use and test menu relative to the vettest analyzer our original chemistry analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes phenobarbital fructosamine total thyroxine “t 4 ” creactive protein and sdma as part of one run key easeofuse features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system these analyzers also enable automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum and urine in addition the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers run a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood allowing veterinarians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently  our  fructosamine test helps veterinarians to diagnose and manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus helping to assess insulin treatments and adjust insulin dosages we launched our total t 4 test globally for use on the catalyst one and catalyst dx analyzers during 2015 t 4  testing is essential to assessing and managing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets we launched the catalyst sdma test globally in 2018 which allows our customers to use the catalyst one and catalyst dx analyzers to screen for sdma an innovative proprietary test that detects the onset of canine and feline kidney disease months or years earlier than traditional methods the catalyst sdma test is also available in a combo kit with t 4  

the catalyst one analyzer launched in november 2014 is engineered to deliver the same laboratoryquality results and realtime work flow as the catalyst dx analyzer the catalyst one analyzer currently offers all the same tests as the catalyst dx including an expanded menu of 32 tests 

we also have two other chemistry analyzers the vetlyte electrolyte analyzer and the vetstat electrolyte and blood gas analyzer the vetstat analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that are manufactured by idexx at our roswell georgia facility 

sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of idexx vetlab instruments 

hematology  we sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also called a complete blood count these analyzers include the procyte dx   hematology analyzer the first and only inclinic analyzer to combine laserflow cytometry optical fluorescence and laminarflow impedance in its analysis the lasercyte dx hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry technology in their analysis and the idexx vetautoread hematology analyzer our original hematology analyzer in addition the procyte dx   hematology analyzer the lasercyte dx hematology analyzer and the lasercyte hematology analyzer each have the ability 

to analyze the components of certain body fluids we also sell the coag dx analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders 

  

the procyte dx   analyzer our premier hematology analyzer provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the lasercyte lasercyte dx and vetautoread hematology analyzers the procyte dx analyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters including the ability to detect band neutrophils nucleated red blood cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin for a more complete picture of a patient’s health the procyte dx is validated for many animal species canine feline equine bovine ferret rabbit gerbil pig guinea pig mini pig llama alpaca camel sheep goat dolphin and hamster the lasercyte and lasercyte dx analyzers are the only other point of care hematology analyzers in the veterinary market able to report absolute reticulocyte counts 

immunoassay testing instruments  during 2014 we launched the snap pro analyzer which automatically activates a snap test properly times the run and captures an image of the result this device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results with the pet owner on the snap pro analyzer screen or via vetconnect plus in addition the snap pro analyzer improves staff efficiency and ensures that all snap test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing in january 2017 we launched proread for the snap pro analyzer proread is a software upgrade that enables the snap pro analyzer to interpret the test results 

with multiplepatient testing functionality the snapshot dx analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total t 4  cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function respectively the snapshot dx analyzer also reads interprets and records the results of many idexx rapid assay snap tests including our canine snap   4dx plus test   feline snap fivfelv combo test canine snap   cpl test feline snap   fpl test and canine snap   heartworm rt test 

urinalysis  in april 2016 we launched the sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer in north america in the fourth quarter of 2016 we launched the sedivue dx analyzer in the uk and australia during the first half of 2017 we continued our international launch of the sedivue dx analyzer to include other parts of europe and new zealand we continued to further our international deployment of sedivue dx in 2018 the sedivue dx analyzer is designed to provide automated realtime results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis the sedivue dx analyzer brings automation speed and consistency to urinalysis a traditionally laborious and variable process its leadingedge technology allows veterinary staff to perform an urine sediment analysis in approximately 3 minutes the sedivue dx analyzer uses proprietary image processing algorithms similar to facial recognition technology to identify clinically relevant particles found in urine and to capture highcontrast digital images that become part of the permanent patient record the sedivue dx analyzer leverages its algorithmic software and machinelearning a type of artificial intelligence to better identify abnormalities with each result generated which we refer to as neural network 30 the idexx vetlab ua analyzer provides rapid automated capture of semiquantitative chemical urinalysis from idexx ua strips and is validated specifically for veterinary use 

idexx vetlab station  the idexx vetlab station “ivls” connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the idexx vetlab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability ivls securely connects to the internet and in this way enables idexx to perform through its smartservice solutions wireless services remote instrument service and software updates to ivls and certain connected instruments ivls also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to vetconnect plus we sell ivls as an integral component of the catalyst one catalyst dx lasercyte lasercyte dx and procyte dx   analyzers snap pro analyzer snapshot dx analyzer and also as a standalone hardware platform the ivls includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers ivls also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the idexx vetlab suite stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap test results and sends and receives information from practice management systems including the idexx cornerstone system as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems 

the snap rapid assays are singleuse handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation although many kits may also be read and recorded automatically by the snapshot dx analyzer or activated and captured automatically by the snap pro analyzer and interpreted using proread as discussed above the principal snap rapid assay tests are as follows 

singleuse canine tests  



 

sales of canine vectorborne disease tests including snap 4dx plus and snap heartworm rt are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practices in the northern hemisphere 

singleuse feline tests

our principal products are the colilert colilert18 and colisure tests which detect the presence of total coliforms and e coli  in water these organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water our products utilize nutrientindicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards including us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water wastewater and water from private wells 

our enterolert products detect the presence of enterococci  in drinking waste and recreational waters enterococci bacteria normally found in human and animal waste are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water our pseudalert products detect the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa  in pool spa and bottled water pseudomonas aeruginosa  is a pathogen that can cause “hottub rash” “swimmer’s ear” and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems our filtamax and filtamax   xpress  products are used in the detection of cryptosporidium  and giardia  in water cryptosporidium  and giardia  are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested we also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by thermo fisher scientific inc that complement our cryptosporidium  and giardia  testing products 

in july 2016 we launched legiolert a simple culture method test for the detection of legionella pneumophila the most common legionella  species in water and the primary cause of legionnaires’ disease the legiolert test is designed to be used on potable or nonpotable water sources with results in seven days 

our quantitray products when used in conjunction with our colilert colilert18 colisure enterolert pseudalert heterotrophic plate count hpc or legiolert products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presenceabsence indication in 2015 we launched the quantitray sealer plus a next generation instrument of the previously available quantitray sealer 2x these instruments are used with the quantitray products for the determination of bacterial density in water samples our simplate for hpc product detects the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample 

we also sell consumables parts and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products 

we sell diagnostic tests services and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry to improve dairy efficiency and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food our livestock and poultry diagnostic products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to livestock veterinarians producers and processors our herd health screening services are offered to livestock veterinarians and producers our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for bovine viral diarrhea virus “bvdv” and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome “prrs” bvdv is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system making the animal susceptible to a host of other infections impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result prrs is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine leading to increased piglet mortality reduced growth and vulnerability to secondary infections 

our principal dairy products use our snap test platform and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk our primary product lines are snap betalactam st and snapduo betatetra st which detect certain beta lactam and tetracycline antibiotic residues we also sell snap   tests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk such as aflatoxin m1 

in june 2016 we launched the rapid visual pregnancy test for cattle which is a pointofcare test that can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding this test provides a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples that enables veterinarians to optimize valueadded medical consulting services while on farm visits 

other 

opti medical 

through opti   medical we sell pointofcare analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes blood gases acidbase balance glucose lactate blood urea nitrogen and ionized calcium and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap these opti analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms operating rooms cardiac monitoring areas and other locations where timecritical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer which launched in 2013 contains many new features relative to previous generation blood gas analyzers including customized work flows faster time to result improved communication and a multilevel electronic control similar to our earlier generation opti cca and opti touch electrolyte analyzers the opti ccats2 runs whole blood plasma and serum samples on singleuse disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes 

other activities 

we own certain drug delivery technology intellectual property that we continue to seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties such as pharmaceutical companies that are included in the other segment 

marketing and distribution 

we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing customer service sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in all major regions including africa asia pacific canada europe middle east and latin america 

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the us outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide generally through our direct sales force we market our diagnostic imaging products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada we market our software products primarily through our direct sales force in the us canada europe and australia we market our water and lpd products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through selected independent distributors we sell our opti electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti products primarily through distributors and other resellers 

research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business segments our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and external consulting and development costs were 1179 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  or 53  of our consolidated revenue 1092 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  or 55  of our consolidated revenue and 1011 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  or 57  of our consolidated revenue 

patents and licenses 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the company based on a variety of factors including providing protection for the company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property affording protection from competitors in certain markets enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings strengthening our reputation and standing among customers employees and key suppliers and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters imitators and other copiers of technologies 

  

important patents and licenses include 

 

in addition we have pending us patent applications concerning reagents and methods for detecting sdma if such applications are granted we expect the associated patents would have expirations ranging from 2036 to 2038 

while we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to us a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position these factors include publications including peerreviewed thirdparty studies that demonstrate the accuracy of our products our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force our online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of including establishing automatic reorder schedules for our consumables tests and other products by our customers the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product offerings that often are patentable and that expand the test menu for our inclinic instruments andor reference laboratory business and our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2018 and are expected to expire in 2019 and beyond the expiration of these patents individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations in addition we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties we rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us and our direct suppliers with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers from time to time we seek to qualify alternative suppliers 

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include certain catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine t4 crp and sdma slides vetlyte consumables lasercyte and lasercyte dx consumables vettest vetautoread and procyte dx analyzers and consumables sedivue dx urinalysis instrument and consumables and components of our snap pro mobile device 

vettest and certain catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire in december of 2031 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest   and catalyst chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market excluding the eu other than to idexx 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain diagnostic imaging systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

certain components incorporated into our snap products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing 

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

backlog 

we do not generally maintain a significant backlog of orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we compete with many companies ranging from large human and animal health pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 



competitors include highly focused smaller companies and multibilliondollar companies with small livestock and poultry diagnostics and water testing solution franchises 

 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals registrations manufacturing import export distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests kits for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval including for the purpose of obtaining product registration as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in japan germany canada brazil the netherlands and many other countries we are also required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our lpd manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the fda under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 

in the eu our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the european medical device directive or the in vitro diagnostic directive which are both strictly applicable to human use products however these systems are subject to the requirements of the electromagnetic compatibility directive which applies to all electronic or electrical products capable of causing or being disturbed by electromagnetic interference and requires european conformity marking on our analyzers in addition we anticipate our analyzers will be subject to the requirements of the restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment beginning in july 2019 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  

enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class i andor class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

the european union regulates and restricts the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these requirements include the biocidal products regulation which may require the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union and the restriction of hazardous substance or rohs which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products 

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and we are also subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act import and export laws and regulations including us import and export control and sanctions laws and laws and regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

as of february 6 2019 we had approximately 8377 employees

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company and our business our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form 10k factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price 

because our business lines are highly attractive they are also highly competitive our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability 

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants given our performance and the market’s strong growth and returns our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 



if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components for our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with such suppliers on reasonable terms breach or termination by suppliers of their contractual obligations inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities disruption to suppliers’ business including work stoppages suppliers’ failure to comply with complex and changing regulations and thirdparty financial failure any problems with our suppliers and associated disruptions to our supply chain could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability disruption to our supply chain could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations trade protection measures tariffs duties importexport restrictions quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters climate changerelated events civil unrest war terrorism or other geopolitical developments including the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote and formal notice in march 2017 to leave the european union computer viruses physical or electronic breaches or other information system disruptions or security breaches and disruptions in utility and other services for more information regarding the risks presented by natural and other disasters and system disruptions and security breaches from cyberattacks see “natural and other disasters information technology system failures and network disruptions and cybersecurity breaches and attacks could adversely affect our business” below 

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology and vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer and consumables image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products even where products and materials are available from alternate suppliers if any becomes unavailable to us for any reason we likely would incur additional costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all in certain cases we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely 

we seek to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers when possible by entering into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable or fixed prices however suppliers may decline to enter into longterm contracts for any number of reasons which would require us to purchase products via shortterm contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have longterm contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have longterm contracts will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers or if such sole and single source suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability 

  

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could   negatively   affect our ability to supply the market   

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products either of which could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  approximately 39  of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including but not limited to disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building staffing and managing foreign operations including a geographically dispersed workforce differing protection of intellectual property trade protection measures quotas embargoes importexport restrictions tariffs duties and regulatory and licensing requirements natural and other disasters ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s regulatory economic or political conditions including as a result of the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote and formal notice in march 2017 to leave the european union other unfavorable geopolitical conditions security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

as a global business we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products as well as the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the manufacture import and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include the biocidal products regulation which require approval for the use of certain biocides in our products prior to being manufactured used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union and the restriction of hazardous substances which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable 

regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact 

in addition some foreign governments require us to register our products and these product registration requirements which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations as well as the associated legal and political environments concerning among other things the importation and exportation of products our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption antimoney laundering and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal regulatory and political requirements and environments differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future 

any failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or to adjust to changing legal and political environments could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation any of these could negatively impact our business 

increased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense as new products services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market in the united states and abroad include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories certain large and wellfunded animal health pharmaceutical companies as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as vca inc formerly named vca antech inc which was acquired in 2017 by mars incorporated another operator of corporate hospital chains while we believe that our reference laboratory service offerings are competitively differentiated due to our proprietary products and services such as the idexx sdma test and vetconnect plus there can be no assurance that increased consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers see “consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business” below 

competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of innovative new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new innovative and competitive products and services which could be superior or be perceived by our customers to be superior to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services while an important aspect of our strategy is to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors’ products or services or otherwise achieve market acceptance some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services perceived in the eyes of customers as similar at substantially lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering certain of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also 

have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us as well as greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the veterinary services industry in the us and abroad has been consolidating over time at an accelerating rate in recent years in the united states the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners pet partners and vca inc and national veterinary associates and are joined by dozens of smaller consolidators a similar trend exists in other regions such as canada europe australia new zealand brazil and china furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally attempt to shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products in addition changes and trends in local dairy poultry or other food markets around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products declines in testing for any reason including the reasons described above along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we 

may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

natural and other disasters information technology system failures and network disruptions and cybersecurity breaches and attacks could adversely affect our business 

our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors beyond our control such as natural disasters andor climate changerelated events such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods civil unrest negative geopolitical conditions and developments war terrorism or other manmade disasters and information technology system failures network disruptions and cybersecurity breaches and attacks any of these events could result in among other things damage to or the temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be costly and may require substantial leadtime to repair or replace damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our thirdparty business partners or suppliers on which we rely a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets an interruption in power supply a temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products a temporary disruption in our ability to deliver or delays in the delivery of our products or services and short or longterm damage to our customers’ businesses which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services for more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers’ operations and supply chain see “our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results” above 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk tokyo japan and leipzig germany interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on several information systems throughout our company as well as our thirdparty business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems to provide access to our webbased products and services keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures and engage in information system redundancy planning and processes such measures planning and processes as well as our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems and our business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses and malware through the internet including via devices and applications connected to the internet email attachments and persons with access to these information systems such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business as information systems and the use of software and related applications by us our business partners suppliers and customers become more cloudbased and connected to the “internet of things” there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats including more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of data and information we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” such as our connected devices eg idexx vetlab instruments any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen while we have implemented network security and internal control measures especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption attack or security breach and as such the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains 

if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions or our customers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services it could result in a period of shutdown of information systems during which we or our customers may not be able to operate the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement potential liability for damages to our customers reputational damage and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business results of operations and profitability furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of data or information including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence 

in our products and services damage our ability to develop and protect our rights to our proprietary technologies and adversely affect our business 

while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events we also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with our global privacy policy or evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

when we collect and use personal data in our operations we apply state of the art data management and security practices and we post on our website a comprehensive global privacy policy and cookie statement concerning the collection use and disclosure of personal data we only use the personal data that we collect as described in our global privacy policy and customer agreements our global privacy policy informs our customers potential customers vendors pet owners website visitors and any other current or potential idexx partner that we will not share their personal information with third parties unless required by law or as reasonably necessary with trusted third parties working for or with us to fulfill or administer orders or contracts made with idexx or to manage our relationship and marketing activities with the applicable customer 

we collect and use personal data in a variety of ways we offer products and services that collect and use personal data provided by client practices and individuals including practice management systems for veterinary practices online client communication tools and services vetconnect plus and twoway integration technology some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various websites and collect contact and other personal data from our customers and visitors to our websites the privacy security retention sharing and use of the personal data described above are subject to expanding and increasingly complex laws and regulations in the us and abroad some of which impose significant compliance obligations some of these laws and regulations apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure sharing and security of personal data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time in many cases the federal state and international laws described above apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations for example we are subject to the european unions general data protection regulation or gdpr which became effective in may 2018 the gdpr imposes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements and could subject us to increased liability for violations additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal data can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators in the us and abroad to expand or adopt more stringent regulations and laws 

while we strive to comply with our posted global privacy policy and contractual obligations as well as all applicable privacyrelated laws and regulations including the gdpr any failure or perceived failure by us the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to so comply could result in damage to our reputation or legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others any of which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal data or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could damage our reputation and harm our business 

  

in addition the laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current global privacy policy and data protection practices the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit our ability to use and share personal data 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

we are a global business with 39  of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2018  attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar 

and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies 

for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 22  of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact 

our foreign currency hedging activities see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18  hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 

we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

  

we sell many products through distributors which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

some of our product sales in international markets occur through thirdparty distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels and changes in our distributors’ inventory levels as compared to comparable prior periods could negatively impact our revenue growth rates we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results while we maintain a rigorous distribution compliance program violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

the nature of our international operations subjects us to local state regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation additionally tax rules governing crossborder activities are continually subject to modification as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted in the us on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us federal corporate tax system effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and transitioned from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system the 2017 tax act introduced new provisions including the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign derived intangible income “fdii” base erosion antiabuse tax “beat’ expanded bonus depreciation and changed deductions for executive compensation and interest expense the us department of treasury continues to issue regulations related to the 2017 tax act which may increase or decrease our tax liability in future periods for example in january 2019 the us department of treasury issued final regulations related to the deemed repatriation tax see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13 income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the 2017 tax act 

we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings in the netherlands and switzerland are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger 

competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

restrictions in our   debt agreements   or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates timing of regulatory approvals and licenses litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid 

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as other general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance the following factors in addition to other factors described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this form 10k may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 



 

in addition broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly furthermore the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that in some cases has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10‑k  

we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form 10k in the  glossary of terms and selected abbreviations” 

description of business segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” with our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 16  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018  included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within unallocated amounts 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by doing so we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

cag diagnostics we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro analyzer are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once revenues from the associated proprietary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro analyzer are recurring in nature in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

diagnostic capital revenue  revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become 

relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as volume commitments such as our idexx 360 program or reagent rentals in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a multiyear customer commitment to purchase recurring products and services 

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2018  our catalyst and vettest chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 50800 units globally as compared to approximately 47000 units in 2017  and approximately 43000 units in 2016 as of december 31 2018 our premium catalyst chemistry analyzers provided for an active installed base of approximately 37000 units globally as compared to approximately 30000 units in 2017 and approximately 24500 units in 2016 approximately 54 of 2018  and 2017 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account has the highest economic value as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers which leads to additional testing by the customer 

as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

the procyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer in addition we sell the lasercyte   dx and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2018  these hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 35900 units as compared to 33400 units in 2017  and 31000 units in 2016  as of december 31 2018 our premium procyte dx and lasercyte dx hematology analyzers provided for an active installed base of approximately 29000 units globally as compared to approximately 26000 units in 2017 and approximately 23500 units in 2016 approximately 67 of 2018  and 59 of 2017 procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte dx and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in the associated recurring revenue stream 

our sedivue dx instrument was launched in north america early in 2016 and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of 2016 during 2017 we continued to launch sedivue dx internationally as of december 31 2018 our premium sedivue dx analyzers provided for an active installed base of nearly 6600 units globally as compared to approximately 4000 units in 2017 and approximately 1500 units in 2016 this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides a highly accurate way to automate the process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables 

we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests including by providing the snap pro analyzer which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record beginning in january of 2017 with our proread software the snap pro analyzer interprets results these features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro analyzer results can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings acquiring new customers maintaining high customer loyalty and retention our ability to realize modest annual price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest 

generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of diagnostics software integration with the ivls and vetconnect plus client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

recurring diagnostic revenue  revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2018  recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounted for approximately 75 of our consolidated revenue 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as demonstrated by peer reviewed thirdparty research as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once including the ability to utilize our snap pro analyzer we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

we believe approximately half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in certain markets outside the us inclinic testing may be less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin 

recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers net of customer losses we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs and our volume commitment programs our upfront customer loyalty programs are associated with customer acquisitions and retention and provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear contractual agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services including reference laboratory services our volume commitment programs such as idexx 360 provide customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services 

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri has allowed us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices including drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

livestock poultry and dairy 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease reproductive and herd health and production management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate 

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business which also leverages the snap platform the dairy snap products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in dairy processors and develop product line enhancements and extensions our rapid visual pregnancy test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding this test provides a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples

opti medical  our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

our facility in roswell georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte needs of the veterinary market we leverage this facility’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review in march 2016 we discontinued certain development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market that were devoted to a new platform and focused our efforts on supporting our current generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer

critical accounting estimates and assumptions 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates part ii item 8 note 2   summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption 

under the new revenue standard revenue is recognized when or as performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to a customer we exclude sales use valueadded and other taxes we collect on behalf of third parties from revenue revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer to meet the requirements of the new revenue standard and accurately present the consideration received in exchange for promised products or services we applied the prescribed fivestep model outlined below 

 

see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3  revenue recognition  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations the timing of revenue recognition billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable contract assets as a result of revenue recognized in advance of billings included within other assets and contract liabilities or deferred revenue as a result of receiving consideration in advance of revenue recognition within our consolidated balance sheet 

contracts with multiple performance obligations  we enter into contracts where customers purchase a combination of idexx products and services determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment we determine the transaction price for a contract based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized we evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts 

we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when transfer of the related goods or services has occurred for each obligation we utilize the observable standalone selling price when available which represents the price charged for the performance obligation when sold separately when standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including but not limited to the cost plus a margin approach 

the following customer programs represent our most significant customer contracts which contain multiple performance obligations 

customer commitment programs  we offer customer incentives upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services 

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide customers with incentives in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement they are required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both upfront incentives to customers in the form of cash or idexx points are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as customer acquisition costs within other assets which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases less upfront incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 5 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced other assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 06 million at december 31 2018 

volume commitment programs  our volume commitment programs such as our idexx 360 program provide customers with a free or discounted instrument or system upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services we allocate total consideration including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments based on relative standalone selling prices to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost in advance of billing the customer at the time of installation and customer acceptance which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and longterm assets the contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for future products and services over the term of the contract we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 5 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 08 million at december 31 2018 

instrument rebate programs  our instrument rebate programs previously referred to as idexx instrument marketing programs require an instrument purchase and provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the program we account for the customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional we allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations including customer’s right to earn rebates on future purchases which is deferred and recognized upon the purchase of future products and services offsetting future rebates as they are earned we estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related these multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition and a 5 change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative revenue related to these programs by approximately 14 million at december 31 2018 

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments upon entering into multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables these types of agreements include an embedded operating lease for the right to use our instrument and no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we determine the amount of lease revenue allocated to the instrument based on relative standalone selling prices and determine the pattern of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum purchase commitment the cost of the instrument is removed from inventory and 

capitalized within property and equipment and is charged to cost of product revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 

other customer incentive programs  certain agreements with customers include discounts or rebates on the sale of products and services applied retrospectively such as volume rebates achieved by purchasing a specified purchase threshold of goods and services we account for these discounts as variable consideration and estimate the likelihood of a customer meeting the threshold in order to determine the transaction price using the most predictive approach we typically use the mostlikelyamount method for incentives that are offered to individual customers and the expectedvalue method for programs that are offered to a broad group of customers refund obligations related to customer incentive programs are recorded in accrued liabilities for the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future 

  

idexx points  idexx points may be applied to trade receivables due to us converted to cash or applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services we consider idexx points equivalent to cash and idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are included in accrued liabilities until utilized or expired breakage is not material because customers can apply idexx points to trade receivables at any time 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases customer rebates and other incentive payments and price adjustments related to multiyear agreements differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition as described above 

inventory valuation 

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with intellectual property that has been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the 

consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

in the fourth quarters of 2018  and 2017  we elected to bypass the qualitative approach that allows the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and instead proceeded directly to assessing the fair value of all of our reporting units and comparing the fair value of to the carrying value to determine if any impairment is necessary 

we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit to validate the reasonableness of our reporting units estimated fair values we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our total market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical intellectual property outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 43 million and 66 of the reporting unit’s carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units with a minimum of 173 and an average of approximately 820 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate 

we had no impairments of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 during the first half of 2016 management reviewed our opti medical product offering which resulted in the discontinuance of our instrument development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and a decision to focus our commercial and 

development efforts to support our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical business resulting from this change in strategy we revised our forecasts downward causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the opti medical asset group noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recognized during the six months ended june 30 2016 the intangibles associated with our opti medical human pointofcare medical diagnostics market are fully written off 

our business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly related to the retention or growth of the customer base during the postcombination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 4  acquisitions and investments  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration arising from business acquisitions 

sharebased compensation 

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all our options granted during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 



 

changes in these subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2018  was 176 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2018  would have increased or decreased by approximately 05 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2018  for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million 

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year 

the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2018  would have increased or decreased by approximately 17 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2018  for options awarded during 2018  would have increased or decreased by approximately 03 million 

for a significant majority of our awards sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a gradevesting methodology for performancebased restricted stock units sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2018  was 252 million  which is net of a reduction of approximately 41 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2018  2017  or 2016  

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued totaled 340 million for the year ended december 31 2018  314 million for the year ended december 31 2017  and 270 million for the year ended december 31 2016  the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2018  was 512 million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 17  years 

income taxes 

the 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us corporate tax system effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and transitioned from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and eliminated or reduced certain domestic deductions among other changes the 2017 tax act introduced new provisions including the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign derived intangible income “fdii” base erosion antiabuse tax “beat expanded bonus depreciation and changed deductions for executive compensation and interest expense see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the 2017 tax act 

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2018  would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the 

expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 260 million as of december 31 2018  and 218 million as of december 31 2017  which includes estimated interest expense and penalties see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13  income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information

results of operations and trends 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

in certain countries we sell our products through thirdparty distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates see “part i item 1 business marketing and distribution” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding distribution channels 

currency impact  for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 22  of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see “part i item 1a risk factors” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts 

effects of economic conditions  pet owners generally pay cash out of pocket for health care services for their pets from veterinary practices demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment 

including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services 

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

effects of patent expiration  although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2018 and several that are expected to expire in 2019 and beyond the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in part i item 1 business patents and licenses” 

nongaap financial measures  the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth” organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates business acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

we exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period 

we also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends effective january 1 2018 we exclude only acquisitions that are considered to be a business from organic revenue growth we consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs processes and outputs are present consistent with asu 201701 “ business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business ” in a business combination if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets we do not consider these assets to be a business and effective january 1 2018 we include these acquisitions in organic revenue growth a typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business such as employees or infrastructure we believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth this change did not have a material impact on organic revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2018 prior to january 1 2018 we excluded all acquisitions from organic revenue growth and we have not restated previously reported organic revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 as this change would not have been material 

we also use adjusted ebitda gross debt net debt gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio all of which are nongaap financial measures that should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for financial measures presented according to us gaap management believes that reporting these nongaap 

financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility 

comparisons to prior periods  our fiscal years end on december 31 unless otherwise stated the analysis and discussion of our financial condition results of operations and liquidity including references to growth and organic growth and increases and decreases are being compared to the equivalent prior year period

total company 

the following table presents revenue by operating segment by us markets and nonus or international markets 



 

total company revenue  the increase in both us and international organic revenues was driven by strong volume gains in cag diagnostics recurring revenue supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies and expanded commercial organization that are driving increased volumes from new and existing customers in our reference laboratory business and the continued expansion of our cag diagnostics instrument installed base our water business also contributed to our international growth primarily from higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories total company revenue included approximately 583 million in 2018 that was attributed to the new revenue standard 

  

the following table presents our total company results of operations 



  

gross profit  total company gross profit increase  was due to higher sales volumes and a 40 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage the increase  in the gross profit percentage was supported by the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio the favorable impact of lower product costs and productivity gains these impacts were partially offset by higher information technology costs including costs that were previously captured within operating expenses increased investments in reference laboratory capacity and employee benefits as well as unfavorable impacts related to instrument program mix under the new revenue standard the impact from foreign currency movements including the impact of hedge gains in the prior period compared to hedge losses in the current period did not have a material impact gross profit included approximately 229 million in 2018 attributed to the new revenue standard 

operating expenses  the increase  in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs as we continue to invest in and grow our global commercial infrastructure the increase  in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions compared to gains in the prior period and information technology investments including ongoing depreciation and maintenance associated with prior year projects these increases were partially offset by certain information technology costs that are now captured within cost of revenue research and development expense increased  primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses of approximately 1 including foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions recorded within unallocated amounts 

companion animal group   

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag ໿ 



 

cag diagnostics recurring revenue  the increase  in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was primarily due to increased volumes in idexx vetlab consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic services supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies expanded commercial organization and to a lesser extent higher realized prices cag diagnostics recurring revenue included approximately 186 million in 2018 that was attributed to the new revenue standard 

idexx vetlab   consumables revenue growth was primarily due to higher sales volumes across all regions for our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables and sedivue dx analyzer payperrun sales supported by growth in testing by new and existing customers and our expanded menu of available tests as well as benefits from higher average unit sales prices idexx vetlab consumables revenue included approximately 125 million in 2018 that was attributed to the new revenue standard 

the increase  in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher sales volumes and average unit prices of canine snap ®   4dx plus tests and higher sales volumes of single analyte snap products rapid assay revenue included approximately 08 million in 2018 that was attributed to the new revenue standard 

the increase  in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from new and existing customers supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies such as idexx sdma ™ and fecal antigen testing and to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenue included approximately 56 million in 2018 that was attributed to the new revenue standard 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue in 2018 

cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue  the increase  in cag diagnostics capital instrument revenue reflects increased placements of catalyst sedivue dx and to a lesser extent procyte dx analyzers supported by the introduction of idexx 360 in the first quarter of 2018 the success of our idexx 360 program caused a shift away from our 

instrument rebate program which resulted in increased upfront instrument revenue recognition attributed to the new revenue standard cag diagnostics capital instrument revenue included approximately 331 million in 2018 that was attributed to the new revenue standard 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue  the increase  in revenue was primarily due to increased diagnostic imaging system placements and higher veterinary subscription service revenue partially offset by lower relative diagnostic imaging system prices veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenue included approximately 64 million in 2018 attributed to the new revenue standard our acquisition of a software company in the second half of 2018 and two software companies in the second quarter of 2017 also contributed 13 to reported revenue growth 

the following table presents the cag segment results of operations 



gross profit  gross profit for cag increased  primarily due to higher sales volumes along with a 10  basis point increase  in the gross profit percentage the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio and the favorable impact of productivity gains were offset by higher information technology costs including costs that were previously captured within operating expenses as well as increased investments in reference laboratory capacity and employee benefits as well as unfavorable impacts related to instrument program mix under the new revenue standard the impact from foreign currency movements had an immaterial impact on the gross profit margin gross profit included approximately 227 million in 2018 attributed to the new revenue standard 

operating expenses  the increase  in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs as we continue to invest in our global commercial infrastructure offset by approximately 21 million related to net deferred costs to obtain contracts under the new revenue standard the increase  in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs incremental information technology investments and costs related to the impairment of construction in progress production equipment in connection with the discontinuation of our inclinic snap fecal product these increases were partially offset by certain information technology costs that are now captured within cost of revenue the increase  in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses of less than 1 

water 

the following table presents the water segment results of operations 



revenue  the increase  in revenue was attributable to higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli  testing in north america europe and latin america and to a lesser extent the benefit of price increases revenue growth in latin america includes the impact of our godirect initiative in brazil which contributed approximately 1 to revenue growth including the impact of reductions in distributor inventories in the first quarter of the prior year the favorable impact of currency movements increased revenue by approximately 20 basis points the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on water revenue in 2018 

gross profit  gross profit for water increased  due to higher sales volumes as well as a 100 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to the net benefit of price increases and to a lesser extent decreases in manufacturing costs the impact from foreign currency movements decreased gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points including the impact of hedge losses in the current year compared to hedge gains in the prior year 

operating expenses  the increase  in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs related to increased head count the increase  in general and administrative expense was primarily due to employee related costs research and development expense was relatively unchanged the overall change in currency exchange rates was immaterial to operating expenses 

livestock poultry and dairy 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 



  

revenue  the increase  in lpd revenue was primarily due to higher herd health screening in the asiapacific region and an increase in recurring poultry testing in asia these increases were partially offset by the impact of an african swine fever outbreak in china continued pressure on our dairy business including impacts from lower milk prices and comparisons to high 2017 yearend government program and distributor orders the favorable impact of currency movements increased revenue by approximately 1 the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on lpd revenue in 2018 

gross profit  the increase  in lpd gross profit was due to higher sales volume and a 130  basis point increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage reflected lower product costs as well as favorable product mix driven by higher herd health screening the impact from foreign currency movements increased gross profit margin by approximately 30 basis points including the impact of hedge gains in the current year compared to hedge losses in the prior year 

operating expenses  the overall decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to cost control initiatives offset by increased consulting costs within general and administrative expenses the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in an increase in operating expenses of less than 1 

other 

the following table presents the other results of operations 



໿ 

revenue  the decrease  in other revenue was due to lower volumes of our opti medical analyzers and related consumables in the middle east and asia partially offset by higher royalties associated with intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line as well as higher realized prices of our opti medical products and services the favorable impact of currency movements increased revenue by approximately 30 basis points 

gross profit  gross profit for other decreased  due to a 340  basis point decrease  in the gross profit percentage primarily due to higher opti medical product costs and to a lesser extent service and distribution costs partially offset by higher opti medical realized price and increased royalties the overall change in currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on the gross profit percentage 

operating expenses    the decreases in sales and marketing and research and development expenses were primarily due to lower personnel costs the increase in general and administrative costs were primarily due to higher facility costs 

  

unallocated amounts 

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

the following table presents the unallocated amounts results of operations 



unallocated amounts  the net change in cost of revenue and operating expenses was primarily due to lower unallocated employee incentive and benefits costs as well as corporate function costs both as a result of increased allocations to our segments these impacts were partially offset by foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions compared to gains in the prior period and an increased investment in research and development 

nonoperating items 

interest income  interest income was 12 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 53 million  for the same period in the prior year the decrease  in interest income was primarily due to the liquidation of our portfolio of marketable securities during the first quarter of 2018 the adoption of the new revenue standard decreased interest income by approximately 10 million in 2018 

interest   expense  interest expense was 347 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 372 million  for the prior year the decrease  in interest expense was due to a lower average balance on our credit facility partially offset by higher variable interest rates   see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 12  debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes and credit facility 

provisions for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 176  for the year ended december 31 2018  and 309  for the year ended december 31 2017  our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was lower primarily related to the reduction in the 2018 us statutory tax rate to 21 from 35 as well as the comparison to a nonrecurring charge resulting from the 2017 tax act for the year ended december 31 2017 these favorable impacts were offset by lower tax benefits related to sharebased compensation and the prior year utilization of foreign tax credits 

our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was reduced by approximately 5 from the tax benefits related to sharebased payments we anticipate the tax benefit related to sharebased payments to reduce our 2019 effective income tax rate by approximately 2 based on recent settlement trends and stock price levels these impacts may vary significantly based on the timing of actual settlement activity

total company 

the following table presents revenue by operating segment by us markets and nonus or international markets 



 

total company revenue  us and international organic revenue growth both reflect strong volume gains in cag diagnostics recurring revenue supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies that are driving increased volumes from new and existing customers in our reference laboratory business and continued strong growth in cag diagnostics instrument installed base including growth in our sedivue dx analyzer installed base international organic growth was strong in europe and asia pacific reflecting the aforementioned cag diagnostics recurring volumedriven growth our water business also contributed to our international growth primarily from higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories in europe the asiapacific region and increases from our godirect initiative in brazil 

  

the following table presents the total company results of operations 



gross profit  total company gross profit increase was due to higher sales volumes and an 80 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage was supported by the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio the favorable impact of lower product and manufacturing costs and favorable mix benefits from high growth cag diagnostic recurring revenues these favorable impacts were slightly offset by a reduction of approximately 20 basis points from currency movements including the combined impact of comparisons to hedge gains in 2016 and hedge losses in 2017 

operating expenses  the increase in total company sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increases in personnelrelated costs as we continued to invest in and grow our global commercial infrastructure the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from information technology investments including ongoing depreciation and maintenance associated with 2016 projects and higher personnelrelated costs offset by a 2016 noncash intangible asset impairment within our opti medical business research and development expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated and consultant costs 

companion animal group 

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 



 

cag diagnostics recurring revenue  the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to increased volumes in reference laboratory diagnostic services and idexx vetlab consumables and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

idexx vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes in the us europe and the asiapacific region from our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables and sedivue dx analyzer payperrun sales resulting from growth in testing by existing and new customers and an expanded menu of available tests as well as higher average unit sales prices 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher sales volumes and average unit price of canine snap 4dx plus tests and higher sales volumes of single analyte snap products 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from existing customers supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies such as idexx sdma and fecal antigen testing additionally the increase in revenue was the result of higher average unit sales prices 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue  the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue reflects our shift to focus sales incentives on the longterm economic value of instrument placements during 2017 partially offset by our sales of sedivue dx analyzer introduced in the second quarter of 2016 our focus on longterm economic value continues to drive new and competitive catalyst placements which are the highest economic value placements due to the incremental cag diagnostic recurring revenue as part of this focus we continue to see declines in the lower relative longterm economic value second catalyst placements as well as growth of our customer commitment programs including upfront customer loyalty programs in the us and reagent rental programs internationally these customer commitment programs 

result in lower upfront instrument revenue recognized at the time of placement and instead the recognition of revenue for these programs occurs over the term of the customer agreement 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue  the increase in customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was primarily due to increasing veterinary subscription service revenue growth in diagnostic imaging placements and higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base these favorable factors were partially offset by lower relative diagnostic imaging system prices 

the following table presents the cag segment results of operations 



gross profit  gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales volumes along with a 110 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage the unfavorable impact of currency reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately 20 basis points resulting primarily from lower hedging gains in 2017 excluding currency impacts the increase in gross margins was supported by the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostic recurring portfolio the favorable impact of lower product and manufacturing costs and favorable mix benefits from high growth in idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay revenues offset by incremental investments in reference laboratory capacity and relatively lower idexx vetlab instrument prices reflecting strong international growth 

operating expenses  the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased personnelrelated costs as we continue to invest in and grow our global commercial infrastructure the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from information technology investments including ongoing depreciation and maintenance associated with 2016 projects and higher personnelrelated costs the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs 

water 

the following table presents the water segment results of operations ໿ 



revenue  the increase in water revenue was attributable to higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli testing in the asiapacific region and north america and the benefits of price increases in latin america revenue growth in latin america was driven by our godirect initiative in brazil which contributed approximately 4 to revenue growth including the impact of reductions in distributor inventories in 2016 and the benefits of price increases in 2017 the favorable impact of currency increased revenue by approximately 30 basis points 

gross profit  gross profit for water increased due to higher sale volumes the gross profit percentage was flat year over year primarily due to the net benefit of price increases which were largely driven by our godirect initiative in brazil offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs and the overall change in currency exchange rates which decreased the gross profit percentage by approximately 70 basis points the change in exchange rates was primarily due to lower relative hedge gains in 2017 

operating expenses  the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs related to increased head count the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from investments in brazil and higher personnelrelated costs research and development expense was lower primarily due to allocation of project costs and certain higher project costs that were incurred in 2016 partially offset by increases in personnelrelated costs due to increased headcount 

livestock poultry and dairy 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 



revenue  the increase in lpd revenue resulted from an increase in swine testing primarily in china expanded pregnancy testing primarily in europe and north america and moderate growth in european bovine program revenues these increases were partially offset by lower dairy producer demand for diagnostic testing particularly in china and brazil and lower herd health screening primarily driven by lower global milk prices the favorable impact of currency increased revenue 110 basis points 

gross profit  the decrease in lpd gross profit was due to higher sales volume offset by a 220 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage reflecting higher product costs the overall change in currency exchange rates had no impact on the gross profit percentage primarily due to increased hedge losses in 2017 compared to 2016 

operating expenses  overall lpd operating expenses increased by less than 2 sales and marketing expenses were higher due to increases in commercial infrastructure investments in emerging markets general and administrative expenses were lower due to a lower lpd allocation of overall overhead costs reflecting the higher relative growth in our cag business as compared to lpd research and development expenses were relatively consistent 

other 

the following table presents the other results of operations 



  

revenue  the increase in other was primarily due to higher realized prices on our opti medical products and services partially offset by lower sales volumes of our opti medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables as a result of temporary product availability constraints during the first half of 2017 

gross profit  gross profit for other decreased due to a 110 basis point decrease in the gross profit percentage as a result of higher manufacturing costs partially offset by higher realized pricing on overall opti medical products and services the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in the gross profit percentage of less than 10 basis points 

operating expenses    the decrease in operating   expense was due primarily to an intangible asset impairment within our opti medical business during the first half of 2016 and lower personnel cost in research and development as a result of discontinuing certain product development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed our opti medical product offering which resulted in the discontinuance of our instrument development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and a decision to focus our commercial and development efforts to support our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical business resulting from this change in strategy we revised our forecasts downward causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the opti medical asset group noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recognized during the six months ended june 30 2016 

unallocated amounts 

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

the following table presents the unallocated amounts results of operations 



  

gross profit  costs of revenues that were not allocated to segments were relatively consistent 

operating expenses  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher than budgeted corporate function spending in research and development information technology facilities management human resources and higher than budgeted employee incentive costs the overall increase in operating expenses was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange gains on monetary assets as compared to losses in 2016 as well as increased benefits from customer interest payments on overdue accounts 

nonoperating items   

interest income  interest income was 53 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 37 million for the same period in 2016 the increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2017 and to a lesser extent higher interest rates as compared to 2016 

interest   expense  interest expense was 372 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 320 million for 2016 the increase in interest expense was due to higher outstanding balances and higher floating interest rates on our credit facility see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 12  debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes and credit facility 

provisions for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 309 for the year ended december 31 2017 and 310 for the year ended december 31 2016 our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 was lower as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 related to sharebased compensation which decreased our effective tax rate by approximately 7 and the utilization of foreign tax credits which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 1 these decreases were offset by the following nonrecurring items a deemed repatriation tax net of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the 2017 tax act and a tax benefit related to state tax credit carryforwards which combined increased our tax rate by approximately 8

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility we generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our diagnostic products and services consulting services and other various systems and services provided to the animal veterinary livestock poultry dairy and water testing markets our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees inventory and supplies taxes research and development capital expenditures rents occupancyrelated charges interest expense and acquisitions at december 31 2018  we had 1238 million  of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 4719 million  on december 31 2017  and 3918 million on december 31 2016  including our portfolio of marketable securities in the prior years working capital including our credit facility totaled negative 1163 million  at december 31 2018  as compared to negative 326 million  at december 31 2017  and negative 890 million at december 31 2016  additionally at december 31 2018  we had remaining borrowing availability of 4498 million  under our 850 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

the 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us corporate tax system the 2017 tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 effective as of january 1 2018 and transitioned the us federal tax system from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system in converting to the new territorial tax system a deemed repatriation tax on previously taxdeferred earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries was required to be recognized as of december 31 2017 and will be payable over eight years as a result of the 2017 tax act we are no longer asserting indefinite reversal under asc 7403025 for undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries as of december 31 2018 and have accrued for any related tax liabilities associated with these earnings 

the following table presents cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries 



as a result of the passage of the 2017 tax act during the fourth quarter of 2017 we liquidated our marketable securities held outside the us during the first quarter of 2018 and recognized a loss of approximately 03 million we repatriated these funds and reduced our revolving debt balance during the first quarter of 2018 

  

the following table presents marketable securities at fair value for the year ended december 31 2017 



 of the 1238 million  of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2018  greater than 99 was held as bank deposits of the 1877 million  of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2017  approximately 82 was held as bank deposits approximately 18 was invested in money market funds restricted to us government and agency securities and the remainder consisted of commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of less than ninety days 

should we require more capital than is generated by our operations for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could raise capital through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in increased interest expense and dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital 



 

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents cash provided used 



operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 268 million  during 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily due to an increase in net income offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities of 343 million  during 2017  as compared to 2016  was primarily due to an increase in net income including the impact of adopting the new accounting guidance for sharebased compensation 

  

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



the cash used by accounts receivable during 2018  as compared to 2017 decreased 65 million due to improved collections at yearend 2018 the cash used by accounts receivable during 2017  as compared to 2016  was relatively consistent with revenue growth 

cash used by inventories for 2018  as compared to 2017  was due to growth in our reagent rental instrument placements in international markets and relatively higher inventory levels to support greater demand the net incremental cash used by inventories during 2017 as compared to cash provided by inventories in 2016 was primarily due to our operational initiatives to optimize inventory levels that were implemented in the first half of 2016 which followed a period of inventory growth to support new products and increasing demand 

cash used by deferred revenue during 2018  was 77  million as compared to cash provided of 36  million in 2017  and cash used by other assets and liabilities during 2018 was 397  million as compared to cash provided of 474  million in 2017 these changes are due in part to the impact of increased instrument placements under our volume commitment program referred to as idexx 360 and fewer instrument placements under our rebate programs customers are not required to pay at the time of instrument placement under our volume commitment programs which contrasts to our rebate programs where customers pay at the time of instrument placement this results in higher cash used due to increases in other assets for our volume commitment programs and decreases in deferred revenue for our rebate programs our transition to the new revenue standard also impacted the classification of cash flow impacts see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 3 revenue recognition  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our volume commitment programs and the impact of the new revenue standard additionally the changes in cash from other assets and liabilities in 2018 as compared to 2017 reflects the prior year deemed repatriation tax on foreign profits from the enactment of the 2017 tax act which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and is payable over eight years 

the decrease in cash provided by deferred revenue during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to customer program mix the increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities during 2017 as compared to cash provided by other assets and liabilities during 2016 was primarily due to the deemed repatriation tax on foreign profits from the enactment of the 2017 tax act which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and is payable over eight years as well as higher relative employee incentive compensation payments 

we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

investing activities    cash provided by investing activities was 1386 million  during 2018  as compared to 1387 million  used during 2017  and 908 million  used during 2016  the increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily due to the sale of marketable securities as a result of our repatriation of cash and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries partially offset by increased capital spending as we expand our westbrook maine headquarters and relocate our core lab in germany during 2018 in connection with the passage of the 2017 tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017 we liquidated our marketable securities and used the cash to partially pay down our credit facility the 

increase in cash used by investing activities during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in net purchases of marketable securities as well as increases in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets and capital spending 

our total capital expenditure plan for 2019  is estimated to be approximately 160 million to 175 million which includes the expansion of our headquarters the relocation and expansion of our german core reference laboratory other capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

financing activities  cash used by financing activities was 5978 million  during 2018  as compared to 2080 million  used during 2017  and 2222 million  used during 2016  the increase in cash used by financing activities during 2018  as compared to 2017  was due to a partial repayment on our revolving credit facility from repatriated foreign cash and an increase in repurchases of our common stock the decrease in cash used by financing activities during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to fewer repurchases of our common stock 

cash used to repurchase shares of our common s tock increased by 868 million   during the year ended   december 31 2018  as compared to 2017  cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by 215 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016  from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2018  we have repurchased 648 million shares for 38 billion during the year ended december 31 2018  we purchased 177 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3687 million as compared to purchases of 175 million shares for an aggregate cost of 2703 million during 2017  and purchases of 307 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3131 million during 2016  we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19  repurchases of common stock  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

as noted above we refinanced our existing 700 million credit facility during december 2015 increasing the principal amount thereunder to 850 million the credit facility matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 2020 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 1250 to 1375 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate based on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0375 based on our leverage ratio 

net repayment and borrowing activity under the credit facility resulted in more cash used of 3000 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 2017  at december 31 2018  we had 3989 million  outstanding under the credit facility net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in more cash provided of 60 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  at december 31 2017  we had 6550 million  outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 13 million for a letter that was issued in connection with claims under our workers compensation policy at december 31 2018 and 10 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy at december 31 2017 the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness crossacceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default 

since december 2013 we have issued and sold through private placements senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of approximately 600 million pursuant to certain note purchase agreements collectively the “senior note agreements” the senior note agreements contain affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of our subsidiaries priority indebtedness 

fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 12  debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes 

should we elect to prepay the senior notes such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable makewhole amounts as defined within the applicable senior note agreements additionally in the event of a change in control of the company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the company the proceeds of which are not reinvested as defined in the senior note agreements we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes the obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable senior note agreement each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness and crossacceleration to specified indebtedness 

effect of currency translation on cash  the net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries these changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change a currency’s value depends on many factors including interest rates the country’s debt levels and strength of economy 

offbalance sheet arrangements  we have no offbalance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and thirdparty guarantees as reflected in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 12   debt  and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 15  commitments contingencies and guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018  included in this annual report on form 10k respectively 

  

financial covenant  the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation as defined in the senior note agreements not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreements the following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation as of december 31 2018   in   thousands  



other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for us employees we retained claims liability risk per incident up to  1  million per year in 2018  1  million per year in 2017  and 045  million per year in 2016  we recognized us employee healthcare claim expense of 527  million during the year ended december 31 2018  472  million during the year ended december 31 2017  and 404  million during the year ended december 31 2016  which represents actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid were 48  million as of december 31 2018  42  million as of december 31 2017  and 40 million as of december 31 2016  

under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for us employees we have retained the first 03 million for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of 25 million 25 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively workers’ compensation expense recognized during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  and our respective liability for such claims as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was not material claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2018  therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respective claim years for the years ended on or prior to december 31 2016 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 13 million  to the insurance companies as security for the claims in connection with these policies 

  

we have total acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liabilities outstanding primarily related to the achievement of certain revenue milestones of 35  million at december 31 2018  as compared to 30  million at december 31 2017  and 09 million at december 31 2016  these contractual obligations are not reflected in the table below 

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below 



 

these commitments do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 242 million and  17  million of deferred compensation liabilities as of december 31 2018  as the timing of recognition is uncertain see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 13  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2018 our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the tax act is 266 million which is expected to be paid in installments through 2025 

not reflected in the contractual obligation table above are agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at december 31 2018  and 2017  and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 22  of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for three of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands singapore and dubai the functional currency is the us dollar 

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2019  excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 8 million and operating income by approximately 4 million additionally our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of december 31 2018  would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 2 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a stronger us dollar will have an unfavorable effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2019  by approximately 37 million 4 million and 003 per share respectively this unfavorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to increase total company operating profit by approximately 11 million and diluted earnings per share by 010 in the year ending december 31 2019  the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at  113  the british pound at  128  the canadian dollar at  075  and the australian dollar at  070  and the japanese yen at ¥ 112  the chinese renminbi at rmb 700  and the brazilian real at r 379  to the us dollar for the full year of 2019  

the following table presents the foreign currency exchange impacts on our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the years december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  as compared to the respective prior periods 



the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of 

tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 18  hedging instruments  to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2018  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and in 2017 and prior the swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 1909 million  at december 31 2018  and 1765 million  at december 31 2017  at december 31 2018  we had 76 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of related tax 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 4 2020 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2018  were 3989 million  at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 363  based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2018  an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 40 million on an annualized basis

description of business by segment 

﻿ 

﻿ 

we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food and improve bovine reproductive efficiency which we refer to as livestock  poultry and dairy “lpd”  our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcar e medical diag nostics market “opti medical” with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments   

﻿ 

the performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally for the year ended december 31 2017 sales of products and services to customers outside the us accounted for approximately 39 percent of our overall revenue see “part i  item 1a risk factors”  “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 201 7 included in this annual report on f orm 10k for more information about our segments and revenue from customers outside of the us

﻿ 

the idexx vetlab suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products all of which are described below additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

﻿ 

blood and urine chemistry  we sell three chemistry analyzers the catalyst one chemistry analyzer the catalyst dx   chemistry analyzer and the vettest chemistry analyzer that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions these three instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” based on ortho’s dry slide technology in addition the catalyst analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by opti medical systems inc “opti medical” one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and other slides also manufactured by idexx blood tests commonly run on these analyzers in clude glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin calcium creatinine blood urea nitrogen total protein  and many others  tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels all three analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the detection of renal disease   

﻿ 

the catalyst analyzers provide significantly improved throughput ease of use and test menu relative to the vettest analyzer our original chemistry analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes phenobarbital fructosamine and total thyroxine “ t 4 ” key easeofuse features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system these analyzers also enable automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the catalyst dx and catalyst one run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum  a nd urine in addition the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers run a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood allowing veterin arians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently  our fructosamine test helps veterinarians to diagnose and manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus helping to assess insulin treatments  and adjust insulin dosages we launched our total t 4 test globally for use on the catalyst one analyzer during the first quarter of 2015 and for use on the catalyst dx analyzer early in the third quarter of 2015 t 4 testing is essential to assessing and managing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets 

﻿ 

the catalyst one analyzer launched in november 2014 is engineered to deliver the same laboratoryquality results and realtime work f low as the catalyst dx analyzer  the catalyst one analyzer currently offers all the same tests as the catalyst dx plus an expanded menu of 30 tests including tests for thyroid disease kidney disease diabetes  and therapeutic drug monitoring

patents and licenses 

﻿ 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the company based on a variety of factors including providing protection for the company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property affording protection from competitors in certain markets enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our product s and offerings strengthening our reputation and standing among customers employees and key suppliers and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters imitators and other copiers of technologies 

﻿ 

important patents and licenses include 



















﻿ 

in addition we have pending us patent applications concerning reagents and methods for detecting sdma if such applications are granted we expect the associated patents would have expirations ranging from 2036 to 2038 

﻿ 

while we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to us  a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position these factors include our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force our online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of including establishing automatic reorder schedules for our consumables tests and other products by our customers the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product offerings that often are patentable and that expand the test menu for our inhouse instruments andor reference laboratory business   our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2017 and are expected to expire in 2018 and beyond the expiration of these patents  individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations in addition  we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights  

﻿ 

to the extent some of our products may now  or in the future  embody technologies protected by patents copyrights  or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors”

production and supply 

﻿ 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties    w e rely on third parties in our supply chain to supply us  and our direct suppliers with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases  these third parties are sole or single source suppliers from time to time we seek to qualify alternative suppliers 

﻿ 

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include catalyst dx and catalyst one   consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine t 4  crp and sdma slides  vetlyte consumables lasercyte and lasercyte dx co nsumables vettest vetautoread and procyte dx analyzers and consumables  sedivue dx urinalysis instrument and consumables and components of our snap pro mobile device 

﻿ 

vettest and catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest   and catalyst chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry sl ides in the veterinary market excluding the eu o ther than to idexx   

﻿ 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

﻿ 

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials  and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain diagnostic   imaging systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock  and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

﻿ 

certain components incorporated into our snap products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing   

﻿ 

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

﻿ 

backlog 

﻿ 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

﻿ 

 

competition 

﻿ 

we compete with many companies ranging from large human and animal health pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies  and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures se veral of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

﻿ 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

﻿ 









﻿ 

 

government regulation 

﻿ 

many of ou r products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals registrations manufacturing import export distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage  and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

﻿ 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis   approval  including for the purpose of obtaining product registration as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with importing and marketing diagnostic products in japan germany canada brazil the netherlands  and many other countries we are also required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our lpd manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 

﻿ 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the fda   under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated mislabeled  or misbranded under the fdc act 

﻿ 

in the eu our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the european medical device directive or the in vitro diagnostic directive which are both strictly applicable to human use products however these systems are subject to the requirements of the electromagnetic compatibility directive which applies to all electronic or electrical products capable of causing or being disturbed by electromagnetic interference and requires european conformity marking on our analyzers in addition we anticipate our analyzers will be subject to the requirements of the restriction of hazardous substances directive or rohs which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment beginning in july 2019

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class i andor class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

﻿ 

the european union regulates and restricts the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these requirements include the biocidal products regulation which may require the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union  and the restriction of hazardous substance or rohs which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign o r reformulation of our products 

﻿ 

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and we are also subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act import and export laws and regulations including us import and export control and sanctions laws and laws and regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data a ny acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of governmen t regulation these may involve  medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

  

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other   information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating our company and our business our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form 10k factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere herein any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price   

﻿ 

because our business lines are highly attractive they are also highly competitive our failure to successfully execute certain strategies within this competitive environment could have a material negative impact on our future growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants given our performance and the market’s strong growth and returns our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

  



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



  

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

﻿ 

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

  

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms breach or termination by suppliers of their contractual obligations inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities disruption to suppliers’ business including work stoppages suppliers’ failure to comply with complex and changing regulations and third party financial failure any problems with our suppliers and associated disruptions to our supply chain could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability disruption to our supply chain could occur as a result of any number of events including but not limited to increases in wages that drive up prices the imposition of regulations quotas or embargoes on key components labor stoppages transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods the unavailability of raw materials severe weather conditions natural disasters civil unrest geopolitical developments war or terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic breaches or other information system disruptions or security breaches and disruptions in utility and other services for more information regarding the risks presented by natural and other disasters and system disruptions and security breaches from cyberattacks see “ natural and other disasters information technology system failures and network disruptions and cybersecurity breaches and attacks could adversely affect our business ” below 

﻿ 

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology and vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer and consumables image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap   rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte   and lasercyte dx hematology analyzer s livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products even where products and materials are available from alternate suppliers if any becomes unavailable to us for any reason we likely would incur added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all in certain cases we may be required to obtain regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely 

﻿ 

 

we seek to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers when possible by entering into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are thus required to purchase products via shortterm contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have longterm contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under those contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers or if such sole and single source suppliers are unable to obtain the components or other materials required to manufacture the products we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and any longerterm disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of customers which could reduce our recurring revenues and longterm profitability 

﻿ 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

  

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria and regulatory requirements   further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products either of which could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

﻿ 

for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 approximately 39 percent of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including but not limited to disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building staffing and managing foreign operations including a geographically dispersed workforce differing protection of intellectual property trade protection measures quotas embargoes importexport restrictions tariffs duties and regulatory and licensing requirements natural and other disasters ongoing instability or changes in a country’s or region’s regulatory economic or political conditions including as a result of the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote and formal notice in march 2017 to leave the european union other unfavorable geopolitical conditions security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

﻿ 

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

 

various us and foreign government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

as a global business we sell products and services in more than 175 countries and operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products as well as the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

﻿ 

the manufacture import and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include the biocidal products regulation which may require approval for the use of certain biocides in our products prior to being used or sold in the european union the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union and the restriction of hazardous substances which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact 

﻿ 

in addition some foreign governments require us to register our products and these product registration requirements which vary among the applicable jurisdictions and change from time to time are often complex and require us to engage in lengthy and costly processes there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any product registration required by one or more foreign governments any inability to obtain or maintain a required product registration in a jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to market and sell the applicable product in that jurisdiction which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations as well as the associated legal and political environments concerning among other things the importation and exportation of products our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption antimoney laundering and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal regulatory and political requirements and environments differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements and adjusting to changing legal and political environments are significant and likely to increase in the future 

﻿ 

any failure by us to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or to adjust to changing legal and political environments could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation any of these could negatively impact our business 

﻿ 

 

increased competition from and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

﻿ 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense as new products services and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market in the united states and abroad include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories certain large and wellfunded animal health pharmaceutical companies as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as the vertically integrated corporate hospital chain formed when mars incorporated acquired vca inc formerly named vca antech inc in 2017 which resulted in the combination of two large us veterinary hospital chains while we believe that our reference laboratory service offerings are competitively differentiated due to our proprietary products and services such as the idexx sdma test there can be no assurance that increased consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete successfully for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers see “consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business” below 

﻿ 

competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of innovative new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new innovative and competitive products and services which could be superior or be perceived by our customers to be superior to our products and services or lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products or services while an important aspect of our strategy is to continue on a costeffective and timely basis to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new and innovative products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop such products and services or that those products or services will be superior to our competitors’ products or service or otherwise achieve market acceptance some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering certain of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial and managerial resources than us as well as greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

﻿ 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

  

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the veterinary services industry in the us and abroad has been consolidating in recent years in the united states the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners pet partners and vca inc and national veterinary associates a similar trend exists in other regions such as europe and is developing in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no 

 

assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

﻿ 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

  

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products in addition changes and trends in local dairy poultry or other food markets around the world could negatively affect the related production markets resulting in a decline in demand for our testing products declines in testing for any reason including the reasons described above along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

  

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

  

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

natural and other disasters information technology system failures and network disruptions and cybersecurity breaches and attacks could adversely affect our business 

  

our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by certain factors beyond our control such as natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes fires and floods civil unrest   negative geopolitical conditions and developments war terrorism or other manmade disasters and information technology system failures network disruptions and cybersecurity breaches and attacks any of these events could result in among other things damage to or the temporary closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities or reference laboratories damage to one of our facilities or the manufacturing equipment we use could be costly and may require substantial leadtime to repair or replace damage to or closure of one or more facilities of our thirdparty business partners or suppliers on which we rely a temporary lack of an adequate work force in one or more markets an interruption in power supply a temporary or longterm disruption in our supply chain including a disruption to our ability to obtain critical components for the manufacture of our products a temporary disruption 

 

in our ability to deliver or delays in the delivery of our products or services and short or longterm damage to our customers’ businesses which would adversely impact customer demand for our products and services for more information regarding the risks presented by disruption to our suppliers’ operations and supply chain see “our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results” above 

﻿ 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities due to the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

we rely on several information systems throughout our company as well as our thirdparty business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems to provide access to our webbased products and services keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures and engage in information system redundancy planning and processes such measures planning and processes as well as our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems and our business partners’ and suppliers’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses and malware through the internet including via devices and applications connected to the internet email attachments and persons with access to these information systems such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business as information systems and the use of software and related applications by us our business partners suppliers and customers become more cloudbased and connected to the “internet of things” there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats including more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of data and information we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks and also offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” such as our connected devices eg idexx vetlab instruments any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen while we have implemented network security and internal control measures especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption attack or security breach and as such the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains 

﻿ 

if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions or our customers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services it could result in a period of shutdown of information systems during which we or our customers may not be able to operate the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement potential liability for damages to our customers reputational damage and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business results of operations and profitability furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of data or information including any of our confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services damage our ability to develop and protect our rights to our proprietary technologies and adversely affect our business   

  

 

while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events   we also maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

﻿ 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

t he privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored maintained received  or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad we offer products and services that collect and use personal data provided by client practices and individuals  including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone and idexx neo  online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from our inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various websites and collect contact and other personally identifiable information from our customers and visitors to our websites 

  numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personally identifiable information including personal data that we receive from our employees customers vendors and visitors to our websites and personal data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services we are also subject to laws and regulations in nonus countries covering data privacy and the protection of personal information eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted  or are considering adopting data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure  sharing and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time in many cases the federal state and international laws described above apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations 

for example in april 2016 the eu parliament adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which among other things imposes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements the gdpr is expected to take effect in 2018 

﻿ 

the laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current data protection and privacy policies and practices further the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit our ability to use and share personal data any failure or perceived failure by us the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to protect employee applicant vendor website visitor or customer personal data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business in addition c oncerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user personal data

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

  

we are a global business with 39 percent of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2017 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 percent and 20 percent for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact 

﻿ 

our foreign currency hedging activities see note 17 — hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 

﻿ 

we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since our hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

﻿ 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by 

 

government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

﻿ 

we sell many products through distributors which presents risks that could negatively affect our operating results

some of our product sales in international markets occur through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products or to maintain certain inventory levels and changes in our distributors’ inventory levels as compared to comparable prior periods could negatively impact our revenue growth rates we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and reputation and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failure to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

﻿ 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

﻿ 

the nature of our international operations subjects us to local state regional and federal tax laws in jurisdictions around the world our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation additionally tax rules governing crossborder activities are continually subject to modification as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques 

﻿ 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted in the us on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us corporate tax system effective january 1 2018 the tax act reduce d the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percen t to 21 percent and transitioned from a worldwide tax system to a territorial ta x system the tax act introduced new provisions including the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign derived intangible income “fdii” base erosion antiabuse tax “beat’ expanded bonus depreciation and change d deductions for executive compensation and interest expense we continue to assess the impact of the new provisions which become effective beginning in 2018 see note 12 – income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the tax act   

﻿ 

we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings in the netherlands and switzerland are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results 

﻿ 

 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

﻿ 

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

﻿ 

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

﻿ 

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

﻿ 

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

  

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability 

﻿ 

we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

﻿ 

we invest our surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities including corporate bonds commercial paper and a shortterm money market fund which invests in securities issued or sponsored by the us government the value and liquidity of these marketable securities may fluctuate substantially and could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio instability in the global financial markets declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio geopolitical events or other factors any adverse changes in the financial markets and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

﻿ 

 

fluctuations in our quarterly or annual results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates timing of regulatory approvals and licenses litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

﻿ 

the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as other general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance the following factors in addition to other factors described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this form 10k may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 

﻿ 

























﻿ 

in addition broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance and factors beyond our control may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly furthermore the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that in some cases has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10 ‑k  

﻿ 

we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form 10k in the  glossary of terms and selected abbreviations”   

﻿ 

description of business segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

﻿ 

certain costs are not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within unallocated amounts 

﻿ 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

﻿ 

companion animal group 

﻿ 

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information manag e ment solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by d oing so  we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

﻿ 

cag diagnostics   we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services v eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight 

  

the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution   to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and idexx vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 

﻿ 

 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once r evenues from the associated propri etary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid a ssay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature  in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services   our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits  have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

﻿ 

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a multiyear customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 

﻿ 

prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received 

﻿ 

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumabl e sales as of december 31 2017 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 47000 units globally as compared to 43000 units globally in 2016 approximately 54 percent of 2017 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers w ho had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally  placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility  and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers  which leads to additional testing by the customer 

﻿ 

as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

﻿ 

the procyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer  in addition we sell the   lasercyte   dx and vetautoread an alyzers as of december 31 201 7 these hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 3 3  4 00 units as compared to 31000 units in 2016 and 29000 units in 2015 a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte dx analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in 201 7  approximately 60 percent of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a subs tantial number of lasercyte dx instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte dx and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in   the associated   recurring revenue stream  

﻿ 

 

our sedivue dx instrument was launched in north america early in 2016 and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of 2016 during 2017 we continued to launch sedivue dx internationally sedivue dx is the first veterinary inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides a highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables 

﻿ 

we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests  by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures  and saves images of the results and    in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record   beginning in january of 2017 with our proread software the snap pro mobile device interprets results th ese features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on th e snap pro screen or  in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the   snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and  in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

﻿ 

our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues   our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results  broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

﻿ 

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus  client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

﻿ 

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2017 recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profita ble accounted for approximately 74 pe rcent of our consolidated revenue 

﻿ 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions  our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

﻿ 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument  our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes  as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians  additionally we 

 

have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers 

﻿ 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once  including the ability to utilize our snap pro mobile device    we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

﻿ 

the expiration of a third party’s us lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo  and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of 2015 we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay s “elisa” technology  test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice 

﻿ 

we believe approximately half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

﻿ 

profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies  when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint   new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the implementation of our alldirect sales strategy in the us   and the subsequent growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years re curring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront customer loyalty programs associated with customer acquisitions and retention provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of pr oducts or services including reference laboratory services   

﻿ 

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri has allowed us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market

water 

﻿ 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices including drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly v alue strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols  as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

﻿ 

﻿ 

livestock poultry and dairy 

﻿ 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease  reproductive  and herd health and production management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate 

﻿ 

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages   the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business which also leverages the snap platform the dairy snap products incorpor ate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penet ration in dairy processor s   and develop product line enhancements and extensions    our rapid visual pregnancy test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding this test provides a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples

opti medical  our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals w e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

  

our facility in roswell georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte needs of the veterinary market  we leverage t his facility’s knowhow intellectual property  and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

﻿ 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review in march 2016 we discontinued certain development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market that were devoted to a new platform and focused our efforts on supporting our current generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer

critical accounting policies and estimates 

﻿ 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates o n an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

﻿ 

revenue recognition 

﻿ 

we recognize revenue when four criteria are m et i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2j  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

﻿ 

multiple element arrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers diagnostic imaging systems or practice management software  combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 

﻿ 

we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element  

﻿ 

 

when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

﻿ 

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

﻿ 

customer programs  we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented in the tables below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 

﻿ 

customer loyalty programs  our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future 

﻿ 

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services we predominately offer upfront loyalty incentives in response to competitive offerings if a customer breaches its agreement they are required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized within other current assets and other longterm assets and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 

﻿ 

 

idexx instrument marketing programs  our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program requiring us to apply judgment to estimate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 at december 31 2017 a 5 percent change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 04 million 

﻿ 

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment or deferred within other assets and is charged to the cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement 

﻿ 

idexx points are considered the same as cash and may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

﻿ 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice  differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition

new revenue standard    we will adopt asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 the “new revenue standard” in the first quarter of 2018 on a modifiedretrospective basis asu 201409 will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance within us gaap see note 2x to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about asu 201409  while asu 201409 will not impact the overall economics of our products and services sold under customer marketing and incentive programs we expect the new revenue standard will require us to accelerate revenue recognition related to certain of our customer programs and to delay revenue recognition for certain other customer programs we expect to accelerate revenue recognition on instruments and systems placed through programs where customers are committed to purchase future goods and services including our upfront customer loyalty and volume commitment programs this change is the result of the new revenue standard no longer limiting revenue recognition to the amount of customer consideration received upon placement conversely we expect to defer an increased portion of revenue related to instrument placements under programs that provide rebate incentives on future purchases including certain of our idexx instrument marketing programs under the new revenue standard future purchases that are optional and not subject to a customer commitment are not considered part of the customer arrangement resulting in the instrument absorbing a higher relative allocation of rebate incentives we expect this change to result in lower instrument revenue upon placement and higher recurring revenues over the term of the rebate incentive program we believe these will be the most significant impacts related to our adoption of the new revenue standard and we estimate a net increase in revenue of approximately 10 million for the year ending december 31 2018 in connection with such adoption the estimated net increase in revenue is the result of anticipated earlier recognition on 2018 activity which is expected to be partially offset by the net impact of the modifiedretrospective cumulative adjustments on 2018 these impacts are expected to increase cag diagnostics recurring revenues related to the modifiedretrospective cumulative adjustments which is expected to be partially offset by a net decrease in both cag diagnostics capital instrument revenue and veterinary software services and imaging systems revenue this assessment is based on the anticipated volume mix and 

 

design of our customer marketing and incentive programs which may change in response to future customer and competitive demands furthermore the new revenue standard requires the deferral of incremental costs to obtain a customer contract over the term of the customer arrangement such as sales commissions based on the current design of our sales commission plans the impact of implementing this element of the new revenue standard is not expected to be material to our results for the year ending december 31 2018

inventory valuation 

﻿ 

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

﻿ 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

﻿ 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized 

﻿ 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with intellectual property that has been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

﻿ 

in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goo dwill impairment test the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

﻿ 

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating   performance 

 

﻿ 

in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units   

﻿ 

as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit to validate the reasonableness of our reporting units estimated fair values we reconcile the aggregate   fair   values of our reporting units to our total market capitalization  valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

﻿ 

we maintain   approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical intellectual property  outlicensing arrangements  and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property  there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately  31 million and 47 percent of the reporting unit’s carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units with a minimum of 150 percent and an average of approximately 550 percent    

﻿ 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing  or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 or 2015 

﻿ 

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to adjust the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate 

﻿ 

 

we had no impairments of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2017 during the first half of 2016 management reviewed our opti medical product offering which resulted in the discontinuance of our instrument development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and a decision to focus our commercial and development efforts to support our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical business resulting from this change in strategy we revised our forecasts downward causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the opti medical asset group noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recognized during the six months ended june 30 2016 the intangibles associated with our opti medical human pointofcare medical diagnostics market are fully written off intangible assets impairments during the year s ended december 31 2015 were not material   

﻿ 

our business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly related to the retention or growth of the customer base during the postcombination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration arising from business acquisitions 

  

sharebased compensation 

﻿ 

effective january 1 2017 we adopted the fasb accounting standard update “asu” 201609 compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including income tax consequences recognition of stock compensation award forfeitures classification of awards as either equity or liabilities the calculation of diluted shares outstanding and classification on the statement of cash flows the tax benefits related to sharebased payments reduced income tax expense by approximately 28 million for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily through a reduction in our effective income tax rate we do not estimate that the level of sharebased payment activity in 2017 will continue in future periods we believe that the historical range of 11 million to 14 million of annual tax benefits reflects a reasonable estimate for 2018 based on current settlement trends and stock price levels these impacts may vary significantly based on the timing of actual settlement activity for more information regarding the adoption of the new sharebased compensation guidance asu 201609 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

﻿ 

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

﻿ 

 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore  we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all our options granted during t he years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

﻿ 





﻿ 

changes in the se subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 201 7 was 157   million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 percent  the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 201 7 would have increased or decreased by approximately  05 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 201 7 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than  01 million 

﻿ 

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 201 7 would have increased or decreased by approximately  15 million  and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 201 7 for options awarded during 201 7 would have incre ased or decreased by approximately 03 million  

﻿ 

for a significant majority of our awards s harebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period  which ranges from one to five years  depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a gradevesting methodology for performancebased restricted stock units sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 201 7 was  235 million which is net of a reduction of   approximately  2 2 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

﻿ 

modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation  there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2017 2016 or 2015 

﻿ 

 

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued totaled 314 million for the year ended december 31 2017  2 70 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and  256 million for the year ended december 31 2015  the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 201 7 was 452 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years   

﻿ 

income taxes 

﻿ 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us corporate tax system effective january 1 2018 the tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and transitioned from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and eliminated or reduced certain domestic deductions among other changes the tax act introduced new provisions including the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” foreign derived intangible income “fdii” base erosion antiabuse tax “beat’ expanded bonus depreciation and changed deductions for executive compensation and interest expense we continue to assess the impact of the new provisions which become effective beginning in 2018 see note 12 – income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the impact of the tax act 

﻿ 

we estimate our future effective tax rate will be reduced as a result of the corporate tax rate reduction and the new provisions provided in the tax act the outlook for our 2018 effective tax rate is 20  21 percent which includes the estimated impact of the tax act 

﻿ 

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

﻿ 

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 percent of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2017 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 

﻿ 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made   

﻿ 

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made to illustrate the impact the reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent from the passage of the tax act resulted in a reduction to our net deferred tax liability of approximately 17 million this decrease in the deferred tax liability increased our net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 

﻿ 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

﻿ 

 

as a result of the tax act we are no longer asserting indefinite reversal under asc 7403025 for undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries earned prior to december 31 2017 we have recorded a provisional amount of 488 million for the deemed repatriation tax liability related to these earnings for operating earnings generated after december 31 2017 we are still analyzing the effects of the change in position as allowed under us gaap 

﻿ 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 218 million as of december 31 2017 and 188 million as of december 31 2016 which includes estimated interest expense and penalties see note 12 – income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements   for more information

recent accounting pronouncements 

﻿

results of operations and trends 

﻿ 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

﻿ 

distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users therefore we believe it is important to track sales to end users in the relevant periods by our significant distributors in order to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on our reported revenue in those periods in addition where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period

in the us effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services while changes in prior year us distributors’ inventory levels impacted 2015 reported growth results distributor inventory levels had an immaterial impact on our reported us sales and growth results in later years in certain other countries we continue to sell our products through thirdparty distributors although we are unable to obtain data for sales to end users from certain less significant nonus third party distributors we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates in the relevant periods 

﻿ 

currency impact  for the year ended december 31 201 7  approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 2 1 percent   for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2 0 percent f or the year ended december 31 201 5  strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see “part i item 1a risk factors ” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts   

﻿ 

effects of economic conditions  demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 

﻿ 

 

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services 

  

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

﻿ 

effects of patent expiration  although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2017 and several that are expected to expire in 2018 and beyond the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in item 1 “ business  patents and licenses”   

﻿ 

nongaap financial measures  the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth and references in this analysis and discussion to “revenue” “revenues” or “revenue growth” are references to “organic revenue growth” organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year  as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates business acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

﻿ 

we exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period 

﻿ 

we also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends  

﻿ 

we also use adjusted ebitda gross debt net debt gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio all of which are nongaap financial measures that should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for financial measures presented according to us gaap management believes that reporting these nongaap financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility

us and international organic revenue growth both reflect strong volume gains in cag diagnostics recurring revenue supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies that are driving increased volumes from new and existing customers in our reference laboratory business  and continued strong growth in cag diagnostics instrument installed base including growth in our sedivue analyzer installed base  international organic growth was strong in europe and asia pacific reflecting the aforementioned c ag diagnostics recurring volume driven growth our water business also contributed to our international growth primarily from higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories in europe the asiapacific region and increases from our godirect initiative in brazil 

﻿ 

 

the following table presents our total company results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

total company gross profit increase was due to higher sales volumes and an 80 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage was supported by the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio the favorable impact of lower product and manufacturing costs and favorable mix benefits from high growth cag diagnostic recurring revenues these favorable impacts were slightly offset by a reduction of approximately 20 basis points from currency movements including the combined impact of comparisons to hedge gains in the prior year and hedge losses in the current year 

﻿ 

the increase in total company sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increases in personnelrelated costs as we continued to invest in and grow our global commercial infrastructure the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from information technology investments including ongoing depreciation and maintenance associated with prior year projects   and higher personnelrelated costs offset by a prior year noncash intangible asset impairment within our opti medical business research and development expense increased primarily due to higher personnelrelated and consultant costs

﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

cag diagnostics recurring revenue the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to increased volumes in reference laboratory diagnostic services and idexx vetlab consumables and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

﻿ 

idexx vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes in the us europe  and the asiapacific region from our catalyst consumables and  to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables and sedivue dx analyzer payperrun sales resulting from growth in testing by existing and new customers and an expanded menu of available tests as well as higher average unit sales prices 

﻿ 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher sales volumes and average unit price of canine snap 4dx plus tests and higher sales volumes of single analyte snap products 

﻿ 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from existing customers supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies such as idexx sdma and fecal antigen testing additionally the increase in revenue was the result of higher average unit sales prices 

﻿ 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

﻿ 

 

cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue    the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue reflects our shift to focus sales incentives on the longterm economic value of instrument placements during 2017 partially offset by our sales of sedivue dx introduced in the second quarter of 2016 our focus on longterm economic value continues to drive new and competitive catalyst placements which are the highest economic value placements due to the incremental cag diagnostic recurring revenue as part of this focus we continue to see declines in the lower relative longterm economic value second catalyst placements as well as growth of our customer commitment programs including upfront customer loyalty programs in the us and reagent rental programs internationally these customer commitment programs result in lower upfront instrument revenue recognized at the time of placement and instead the recognition of revenue for these programs occurs over the term of the customer agreement 

﻿ 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue the increase in customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was primarily due to increasing veterina ry subscription service revenue growth in diagnostic imaging placements and higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base these favorable factors were partially offset by lower relative diagnostic imaging system prices

cag gross profit   gross profit for   cag   increased due to higher sales volumes along with a 110 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage  the unfavorable impact of currency reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately 20 basis points resulting primarily from lower hedging gains in 2017  excluding currency impacts the increase in gross margins was supported by the net benefit of price increases in our cag diagnostic recurring portfolio the favorable impact of lower product and manufacturing costs and favorable mix benefits from high growth in idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay revenues offset by incremental investments in reference laboratory capacity and relatively lower idexx vetlab instrument prices reflecting strong international growth 

﻿ 

cag operating expenses the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased personnelrelated costs as we continue to invest in and grow our global commercial infrastructure the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from information technology investments including ongoing depreciation and maintenance associated with prior year projects and higher personnelrelated costs the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnelrelated costs

water 

﻿ 

the following table presents the water segment results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

revenue   the increase in water revenue was attributable to higher sales volumes of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and e coli testing in the asiapacific region and north america and the benefits of price increases in latin america revenue growth in latin america was driven by our godirect initiative in brazil which contributed approximately 4 percent to revenue growth including the impact of reductions in distributor inventories in 2016 and the benefits of price increases in 2017 the favorable impact of currency increased revenue by approximately 30 basis points 

﻿ 

gross profit   gross profit for water increased due to higher sale volumes the gross profit percentage was flat year over year primarily due to the net benefit of price increases which were largely driven by our godirect initiative in brazil offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs and the overall change in currency exchange rates which decreased the gross profit percentage by approximately 70 basis points  the change in exchange rates was primarily due to lower relative hedge gains in 2017  

﻿ 

operating expenses the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs related to increased head count the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from investments in brazil and higher personnelrelated costs research and development expense was lower primarily due to allocation of project costs and certain higher project costs that were incurred in 2016 partially offset by increases in personnelrelated costs due to increased headcount

﻿ 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

revenue   the increase in lpd revenue resulted from an increase in swine testing primarily in china expanded pregnancy testing primarily in europe and north america and moderate growth in european bovine program revenues these increases were partially offset by lower dairy producer demand for diagnostic testing particularly in china and brazil and lower herd health screening primarily driven by lower global milk prices the favorable impact of currency increased revenue 110 basis points 

﻿ 

gross profit   the decrease in lpd gross profit was due to higher sales volume offset by a 220 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage reflecting higher product costs the overall change in currency exchange rates had no impact on the gross profit percentage primarily due to increased hedge losses in the current year compared to the prior year 

﻿ 

operating expenses overall  lpd operating expenses increased by less than 2 percent sales and marketing expenses were higher due to increases in commercial infrastructure investments in emerging markets general and administrative expenses were lower due to a lower lpd allocation of overall overhead costs reflecting the higher relative growth in our cag business as compared to lpd research and development expenses were relatively consistent 

 

other 

﻿ 

the following table presents the other results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

revenue   the increase in other was primarily due to higher realized prices on our opti medical products and services partially offset by lower sales volumes of our opti medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables as a result of temporary product availability constraints during the first half of 2017 

﻿ 

gross profit gross profit for other decreased due to a 110 basis point decrease in the gross profit percentage as a result of higher manufacturing costs partially offset by higher realized pricing on overall opti medical products and services the overall change in currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease in the gross profit percentage of less than 10 basis points 

﻿ 

operating expenses   the decrease in operating expense was due primarily to an intangible asset impairment within our opti medical business during the first half of 2016 and lower personnel cost in research and development as a result of discontinuing certain product development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market 

﻿ 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed our opti medical product offering which resulted in the discontinuance of our instrument development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and a decision to focus our commercial and development efforts to support our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical business resulting from this change in strategy we revised our forecasts downward causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the opti medical asset group noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recognized during the six months ended june 30 2016

the following table presents the unallocated amounts results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

  gross profit costs of revenues that were not allocated to segments were re latively consistent  

﻿ 

operating expenses   the increase in operating expenses was primar ily due to higher than budgeted corporate function spending in research and development information technology  facilities management human resources and higher than budgeted employee incentive costs the overall increase in operating expenses was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange gains on monetary assets as compared to losses in the prior year as well as increased benefits from customer interest payments on overdue accounts 

﻿ 

nonoperating items 

﻿ 

interest income interest income was 53 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 37 million for   the same period in the prior year the increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2017 and to a lesser extent higher interest rates as compared to the prior year 

  

interest expense interest expense   was 372 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 320 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense was due to higher outstanding balances and higher floating interest rates on our credit facility see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes and credit facility

cag diagnostics recurring revenue   the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our idexx vetlab consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services resulting from increased volumes and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

﻿ 

idexx vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sa les volumes in the us europe and the asiapacific region from our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables resulting from growth in testing by existing customers the acquisition of new customers and an expanded menu of available tests these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our vettest   chemistry instrument due to customer upgrades from our previous generation vettest to our catalyst analyzers idexx vetlab consumables revenue also benefited from higher average unit sales prices 

﻿ 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher   average unit price and sales volumes of   snap 4dx and   higher sales volumes of   single analyte snap   products these favorable factors were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of lower average unit sales prices in the us for certain earlier generation rapid assay products 

﻿ 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from existing customers   and   the net acquisition of new customers   supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies   such as   the idexx sdma test  also revenue increased to a lesser extent from   higher average unit sales prices due to price   increases testing volumes benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016  

﻿ 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

﻿ 

  cag diagnostics capital – instruments revenue   the increase in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue   resulted from the launch of our sedivue dx analyzer in the second quarter of 2016  which   contributed approximately 23   percent to reported and organic   instrument revenue growth and higher procyte dx revenues partly offset by lower catalyst revenues resulting from a shift in placements from our catalyst dx 

 

analyzer to our lower priced catalyst one analyzer and the prior year benefit of recognizing previously deferred revenues associated with preorders of our catalyst one analyzer in the us in 2014 

﻿ 

veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue the increase in veterinary   software services and diagnostic imaging   systems revenue was due primarily to increasing diagnostic imaging systems revenue higher veterinary   subscription   service revenue  including increases in our pet health network pro subscriber base and higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base   of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems   revenues from diagnostic imaging systems were higher due to the timing of revenue recognized from fewer deferred revenue placements under upf ront customer loyalty programs  and the recognition of previously deferred   revenues these favorable factors were partially offset by fewer licensedbased cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscriptionbased model for new practice management customer acquisitions as well as lower average unit sale prices on diagnostic imaging system placements

the following table presents the water segment results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

revenue   the increase in water revenue   was attributable to all regions in which we operate most notably from strong performance in north america europe  and the asiapacific region higher revenues   resulted primarily from increased   sales volumes and price increases of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and   e coli testing placements of our quantitray sealer plus instrument which we launched in june   2015 several large project orders during the first half of 2016 and to a   lesser extent from higher sales volumes of our products designed to detect   cryptosporidium related to an outbreak in the united kingdom   beginning in mid2015 through the first half of   2016 testing volumes   also   benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016 

﻿ 

gross profit   gross profit for water increased due to higher sales volumes offset by a 180 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage the unfavorable impact of currency reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately 210 basis points resulting from lower hedging gains and changes in foreign currency exchange rates excluding currency impacts the gross profit percentage increased slightly due to the net benefit of price increases on our colilert testing products and related accessories

﻿ 

the following table presents the lpd segment results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

revenue   the overall change in exchange rates reduced revenue growth by approximately 160 basis points the increase in lpd organic revenue resulted from strong performance in emerging markets most notably resulting from higher sales volumes of swine poultry and bovine pregnancy products and services in various regions this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of bovine testing products within western europe in large part due to the success of certain disease eradication programs in the region as well as pressure on our dairy testing business due to a decline in worldwide milk prices 

﻿ 

gross profit   gross profit for lpd decreased due to a reduction in the gross profit percentage of 460 basis points the decrease in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable currency impact primarily due to lower relative hedging gains additionally higher overall manufacturing costs which were partially offset by the expiration of royalties on certain of our swine testing products resulted in an overall lower gross profit 

﻿ 

operating expenses   the increase in sales and marketing expense   for the   year ended   december   31 2016 was due to higher commercial   infrastructure investments within emerging markets   the increase in general and administrative expense   resulted primarily from higher investments in emerging markets including brazil the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher external product development and material costs all the increases above were partially   offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

other 

﻿ 

the following table presents the other results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

revenue   the increase in other revenue was due primarily to royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line partially offset by   lower sales volumes of our opti medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables   

﻿ 

gross profit   gross profit for other increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage of 340 basis points the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from higher relative royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line partly offset by an increase in overall opti medical product costs 

﻿ 

operating expenses   operating expenses for other which totaled 107 million for the year ended   december 31 2016 increased 03   million due primarily to   intangible impairments within our opti medical business partly offset by   lower amortization expense on the aforementioned intangible assets and a reduction in personnelrelated costs 

﻿ 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review we discontinued our product development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market during march 2016 and focused our commercial efforts in this market on supporting our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer  management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical line of business resulting from this change in strategy we revised our forecasts downward causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value   of the opti medical asset group noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recorded during the year ended december 31 2016

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

﻿ 

the following table presents the unallocated amounts results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

gross profit   gross profit for unallocated amounts decreased due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs as compared to budget  the increase in personnelrelated costs was due primarily to higher selfinsured healthcare costs and higher than budgeted employee incentives reported within unallocated amounts during the year ended december 31 2016 

﻿ 

operating expenses   operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 76 million to 145 million for the year ended december 31 2016 due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs as compared to budget reflecting increased employee incentives and higher selfinsured health claim expenses as well as certain foreign exchange losses on monetary assets due to strengthening of the us dollar this compares to prior period cost control initiatives that resulted in lower than budgeted costs partially offsetting these increases was the aforementioned   82 million impairment charge recorded in 2015 related to   internallydeveloped software not yet placed into service as a result of a strategic shift to refocus our development efforts within our veterinary software and services business 

﻿ 

 

nonoperating items   

﻿ 

interest income   interest income was 37 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 25 million for   the prior year the increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2016 and to a lesser extent higher interest rates  

  

interest expense   interest expense   was 320 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 292 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense resulted from higher relative interest incurred in 2016 as a result of approximately 250 million in senior notes that we issued and sold through private placements during the first half of 2015 for which fixed interest rates range from 1785 percent to 372 percent additionally the increase in interest expense was due to higher relative interest rates on our credit facility see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes and credit facility 

﻿ 

provision for income taxes   our effective income tax rate was 310 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 297 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily related to a change in earnings mix in 2016 with relatively higher earnings subject to domestic tax rates as opposed to lower international tax rates including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates

liquidity and capital resources 

﻿ 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility in addition we issued 150 million of senior notes in february 2015 and € 889 million of eurodenominated senior notes in june 2015 during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we purchased marketable debt securities using a portion of our cash balances we generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our diagnostic products and services consumables consulting services and other various systems and services provided to the animal veterinary livestock  poultry dairy and water testing markets our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees inventory and supplies taxes research and development capital expenditures rents occupancyrelated charges interest expense and acquisitions   at de cember 31 2017 we had 4719 million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as compared to 3918 million on december 31 2016 and 3 4 2 6 million on december 31 2015  working capital including our credit facility totaled negative  32  6 million at december 31 2017 as compared to negative  89  0 million at december 31 2016 and negative 35  1 million at december 31 2015 additionally at december 31 2017 we had remaining borrowing availability of  1940 million under our 850 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents our portfolio of shortduration marketable securities funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our business as currently conducted

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and includes significant changes to the us corporate tax system the tax act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective as of january 1 2018 and transitioned the us federal tax system from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system in converting to the new territorial tax system a deemed repatriation tax on previously taxdeferred earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries was required to be recognized as of december 31 2017 and will be payable over eight years 

﻿ 

as a result of the tax act we are no longer asserting indefinite investment for undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries earned prior to december 31 2017 we have recorded a provisional amount of 488 million for the deemed repatriation tax liability related to these earnings which will be paid over eight years

of the 1877 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2017 approximately 82 percent was held as bank deposits approximately 18 percent was invested in money market funds   restricted to us government and agency securities and the remainder consisted of commercial paper   and other securities   with original maturities of less than ninety days of the 1549 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2016 76 percent was held as bank deposits 22 percent was invested in money market funds   restricted to us government and agency securities and the remainder consisted of commercial paper   and other securities   with original maturities of less than ninety days 

﻿ 

should we require more capital than is generated by our operations for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could raise capital through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in increased interest expense and dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates

sources and uses of cash 

﻿ 

the following table presents cash provided used   

﻿ 



﻿ 

operating activities the increase in cash provided by o perating activities of  343 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in net income  including the impact of adopting the new accounting guidance for sharebased compensation the in crease in cash provided by operating activities of  1171 million during 2016 as compared to 2015 was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities as well as an increase in net income including increases in noncash charges  

﻿ 

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015   

﻿ 



﻿ 

the cash used by accounts receivable during 2017 as compared to 2016   was relatively consistent with revenue growth    the reduction in cash used by accounts receivable during 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the absence of the impacts related to our change in us commercial strategy impacting the first quarter of 2015 the incremental cash used by accounts receivable for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to our transition to an alldirect strategy in the us including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our us endusers that previously purchased from our us distribution partners which take a longer elapsed time to collect additionally accounts receivable was impacted by revenue growth for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 relative to the respective prior periods including the margin capture associated with the aforementioned alldirect strategy 

﻿ 

the net incremental cash used by inventories during 2017 as compared to cash provided by inventories in 2016 was primarily due to our operational initiatives to optimize inventory levels that were implemented in the first 

 

half of 2016 which followed a period of inventory growth to support new products and increasing demand cash used by inventories for 2015 was primarily due to growth in our volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher inventory levels to support new instrument and diagnostic test launches 

﻿ 

the decrease in cash provided by deferred revenue during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to customer program mix the increase in cash provided by deferred revenue during 2016 as compared to cash used by deferred revenue for 2015 was primarily due to the recognition in 2015 of deferred revenues related to our 2014 catalyst one   introductory offer where we presold the instrument and provided customers with temporary use of a catalyst dx instrument 

﻿ 

the increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities during 2017 as compared to cash provided by assets and liabilities during 2016 was primarily due to the deemed repatriation tax on foreign profits from the enactment of the tax act which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and is payable over eight years as well as higher relative employee incentive compensation payments the decrease in cash provided by other assets and liabilities during 2016 as compared to 2015 was the result of higher taxable income in 2015 income tax payments were lower during 2015 resulting from onetime impacts of implementing our us alldirect strategy and the benefit from the tax increase prevention act enactment late in the fourth quarter of 2014 the net incremental cash provided by other assets and liabilities for 2015 was also due to the recognition of previously deferred catalyst instrument costs under the catalyst one introductory offer during 2015 

﻿ 

  we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

﻿ 

investing activities  cash used by investing activities was 1387 million during 2017 as compared to 908 million used during 2016 and 3084 million used during 2015 the increase in cash used by investing activities during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in net purchases of marketable securities as well as increases in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets and capital spending the decrease in cash used by investing activities during 2016 as compared to 2015 was due primarily to the initial purchase of marketable securities that began in 2015 during 2018 in connection with the passage of the tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017 we intend to liquidate our marketable securities and use the cash to partially pay down our credit facility 

  

our total capital expenditure plan for 201 8 is estimated to be approximately  140 million which includes the expansion of our headquarters the relocation and expansion of our german core reference laboratory other capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure  and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

﻿ 

financing activities cash used by financing activities was 2080 million during 2017 as compared to 2222 million used during 2016 and  1010 million used during 2015 the decrease in cash used by financing activities during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to fewer repurchases of our common stock  the increase in cash used by financing activities during 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the issuance of senior notes in 2015 as well as a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock 

﻿ 

in june 2015 we entered into an amended and restated multicurrency note purchase and private shelf agreement the “2015 amended agreement” among the company prudential investment management inc “prudential” and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein which amends and restates the note purchase and private shelf agreement dated july 21 2014 pursuant to the 2015 amended agreement we issued and sold through a private placement a principal amount of €889 million of 1785 series c senior notes due june 18 2025 the “2025 series c notes” we used the net proceeds from this issuance and sale of the 2025 series c notes for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under our credit facility 

﻿ 

in december 2014 we entered into a multicurrency note purchase and private shelf agreement the “metlife agreement” with accredited institutional purchasers named therein pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 75 million of 325 series a senior notes having a sevenyear term the “2022 notes” and 75 million 

 

of 372 series b senior notes having a twelveyear term the “2027 notes” in february 2015 we issued and sold the 2022 notes and the 2027 notes pursuant to the metlife agreement we used the net proceeds from these issuance and sales for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under our credit facility 

﻿ 

cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by  215 million during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016  cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by  97  9 million during the year ended december 31 201 6 as compared to 2015  from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2017  we have repurchased 630 million shares during the year ended december 31 2017 we purchased 1  75 million shares for an aggregate cost of  2703 million as compared to purchases of 3  1 million shares for an aggregate cost of  313  1 million during 2016 and purchases of 5  7 million shares for an aggregate cost of  406  4 million during 201 5  we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share   repurchases 

﻿ 

as noted above we refinanced our existing 700 million credit facility during december 2015 increasing the principal amount thereunder to 850 million the credit facility matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 2020 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 1250 to 1375 percentage points above the london interban k offered rate or the canadian d ollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate based on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0375 percent based on our leverage ratio 

﻿ 

net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in more   cash provided of  60 million during the year ended december 31 201 7 as compared to 2016  at december 31 201 7  we had  6550 million outstanding under the credit facility net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in more cash provided of 1 40 million during the year ended december 31 201 6  compared to 2015  at december 31 201 6  we had  611 0 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy the credit facility contains affirmative negative  and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates  and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations  the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization  and sharebased compensation not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2017 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility   the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness crossacceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default

﻿ 

effect of currency translation on cash   the n et effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries these changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change a currency’s value depends on many factors including interest rates the country’s debt levels and strength of economy 

﻿ 

off balance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and third party guarantees as reflected in note 11 and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 included in this annual report on form 10k respectively

other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

﻿ 

under our w orkers’ compensation insurance policies for us employees we have retained the first  03   million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of 25 million 26 million  and 35 million for the year s ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively workers’ compensation expense recognized during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 and our respective liability for such claims as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 was not material claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2017 therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respective claim years for the years ended on or prior to december 31 2015 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 10 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies  

﻿ 

under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for us employees we retained claims liability risk per incident up to 1 million per year in 2017 045 million per year in 2016 and 043 million per year in 2015 we recognized employee healthcare claim expense of 47  2 million during the year ended december 31 2017 404 million during the year ended december 31 2016 and 346 million during the year ended december 31 2015 which represents actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid were 42 million as of december 31 2017 40 million as of december 31 2016 and 48 million as of december 31 2015 

﻿ 

we have total acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liabilities outstanding primarily related to the achievement of certain revenue milestones of   30 million at december 31 201 7  as compared to  0 9 million at december 31 201 6  and  5  9 million at december 31 201 5  these contractual obligations are not reflected in the table below 

﻿ 

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below 







﻿ 

these commitments do not reflect u nrecognized tax benefits of  214 million and  22 million of deferred compensation liabilities as of december 31 201 7 as the timing of recognitio n is uncertain see note 12   to th e consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 

﻿ 

not reflected in the contractual obligation table above are agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement in many cases we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal accordingly we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at december 31 201 7 and 201 6 and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

﻿ 

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 21 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 and 20 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for three of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands singapore and dubai the functional currency is the us dollar   

﻿ 

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2018 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 percent strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 8 million and operating income by approximately 4 million additionally our foreign currency hedge contracts in place as of december 31 2017 would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 2 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

﻿ 

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a weaker us dollar will have a favorable effect on our operating results by increasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2018 by approximately 46 million 14 million and 012 per share respectively this favorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to decrease total company operating profit by approximately 7 million and diluted earnings per share by 006 in the year ending december 31 2018 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 122 the british pound at 140 the canadian dollar at 079 and the australian dollar at 078 and the japanese yen at ¥111 the chinese renminbi at rmb 645 and the brazilian real at r321 to the us dollar for the full year of 2018 

﻿ 

the following table presents the foreign currency exchange impacts on our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the years december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 as compared to the respective prior periods 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies 

 

for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

﻿ 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

﻿ 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2017 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

﻿ 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 percent of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales totaled 1765 million at december 31 2017 and 1759 million at december 31 2016  at december 31 2017 we had 52 million of net unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of related tax expense 

﻿ 

we have a credit facility with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 4 2020 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2017 were 655 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 281 percent based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2017 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 percent would increase interest expense by approximately 66 million on an annualized basis 

﻿ 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we purchased marketable debt securities which are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report on form 10k the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2017 we estimate that a 1 percent increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately 15 million

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity marking for their products 

﻿ 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

﻿ 

 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class i andor class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

﻿ 

the european union regulates and restricts the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these requirements include the biocidal products regulation which may require the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being used or sold in the european union and the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign o r reformulation of our products 

﻿ 

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and we are also subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act import and export laws and regulations including us import and export control and sanctions laws and laws and regulations governing the collection use retention sharing and security of data a ny acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of governmen t regulation these may involve  medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report 

  

our business lines are highly competitive and our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a material negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

  



  



  



  





﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 



  

 

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

﻿ 

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

  

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 

﻿ 

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap   rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte   and lasercyte dx hematology analyzer s livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

﻿ 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

  

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

 

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

﻿ 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense our competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market include companies that develop manufacture and sell veterinary diagnostic tests and commercial veterinary reference laboratories as well as corporate hospital chains that operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals such as vca inc formerly named vca antech inc in january 2017 mars incorporated and vca announced that mars incorporated agreed to acquire vca with the acquisition expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 if this acquisition closes it could result in the combination of two large us veterinary hospital chains into a vertically integrated corporate hospital chain providing reference laboratory services to its hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals while we believe that our reference laboratory service offerings are competitively differentiated due to our proprietary products and services such as the idexx sdma test there can be no assurance that increased consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers would not have a negative impact on our ability to compete for more information regarding the risks presented by consolidation and reference laboratory vertical integration among our customers see “consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business” below 

﻿ 

competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products our former us distribution partners currently promote and sell competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products which may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

﻿ 

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

in the us the manufacture and sale of certain of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our diagnostic tests for animal health applications that involve the detection of infectious diseases including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

﻿ 

the manufacture and sale of our products as well as our research and development processes are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries for example the european union regulates the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes these regulations include the biocidal products regulation which may require approval for the use of certain biocides in our products prior to being used or sold in the european union and the european regulation for registration evaluation authorization 

 

and restriction of chemical substances or reach which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the european union compliance with these regulations and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products and may reduce or eliminate the availability of certain parts and components used in our products and services in the event our suppliers are unable to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely and costeffective manner any redesign or reformulation or restricted supply of parts and components may negatively affect the availability or performance of our products and services add testing leadtimes for products and reformulated products reduce our margins result in additional costs or have other similar effects in addition the costs to comply with these regulations may be significant any of these could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations these legal and regulatory requirements are complex and subject to change and we continue to evaluate their impact 

﻿ 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws and immigration and travel restrictions these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future 

﻿ 

any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions product recalls suspensions or discontinuations of or limitations or restrictions on our ability to design manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation 

﻿ 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

  

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the us veterinary industry has been consolidating in recent years the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars incorporated owner of banfield pet hospitals blue pearl veterinary partners and pet partners national veterinary associates and vca inc formerly named vca antech inc in january 2017 mars incorporated and vca announced that mars incorporated agreed to acquire vca with the acquisition expected to close in the third quarter of 2017 a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and the nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies and there can be no assurance that hospitals that otherwise become affiliated with these companies would not shift all or a portion of their testing to such reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

﻿ 

our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

 

  

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

  

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

  

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european union’s standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

﻿ 

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

we offer products and services that collect and use data provided by client practices and individuals  including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone and neo  online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various idexx websites and collect contact and other personally identifiable information from our customers and visitors to our websites 

  federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personally identifiable information including data that we receive from our employees customers vendors and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions including requiring local storage and processing of data these laws and regulations continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be inconsistent with our current data protection and privacy policies and practices 

  

 

for example on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union decided that the euus safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which allowed transfers of personal data to the us in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws was invalid   on february 2 2016 us and european commission officials announced they had agreed upon a framework for a new data sharing agreement called the euus privacy shield to replace the euus safe harbor framework the european commission and the us department of commerce issued the final text for the privacy shield framework in july 2016 and it became operational when the us department of commerce began accepting applications for privacy shield ce rtification on august 1 2016 we submitted our selfcertification under the privacy shield in september 2016 and adopted this framework to transfer personal data to the us in compliance with eu data protection laws effective as of january 10 2017 the us department of commerce completed its review of our selfcertification and we joined the privacy shield list of participating organizations 

additionally in april 2016 the eu parliament adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which among other things imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance and is expected to take effect in 2018 the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 

﻿ 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

  

we are a global business with 39 percent of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2016 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 20 percent and 22 percent for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact 

﻿ 

our foreign currency hedging activities see note 17 — hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place in addition our hedging activities involve costs and risks such as transactions costs and the risk that our hedging counterparties will default on their obligations 

﻿ 

we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus 

 

currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

﻿ 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

﻿ 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

﻿ 

for the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 39 percent of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 39 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 and 43 percent for the year ended december 31 2014 although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products fluctuations in oil prices increased border protection and restriction on travel the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport restrictions duties and licensing requirements natural disasters unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

﻿ 

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

﻿ 

 

our business sells many products through distributors which present risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

﻿ 

we sell many of our products outside of the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

﻿ 

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

﻿ 

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters system disruptions and security breaches and disruptions attacks or breaches of information systems could adversely affect our business 

  

the operation of all of our facilities as well as those of our third party business partners on which we rely may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

  

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

we rely on several information systems throughout our company as well as our business partners’ information systems to keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems and our business partners’ information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses through the internet including via devices and applications connected to the internet email attachments and persons with 

 

access to these information systems we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen while we have implemented network security and internal control measures and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption attack or security breach in addition we offer products and services that connect to and are part of the “internet of things” such as our connected devices eg idexx vetlab instruments while we have implemented security measures to protect our connected products and services from cyberattacks the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains 

﻿ 

if we or our business partners were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions or our customers were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach via any of our connected products and services it could result in a period of shutdown of information systems during which we or our customers may not be able to operate the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement potential liability for damages to our customers reputational damage and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of information including any of our confidential or proprietary information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services damage our ability to develop and protect our rights to our proprietary technologies and adversely affect our business 

  

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

﻿ 

risks associated with fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

﻿ 

we invest our surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities including corporate bonds commercial paper and a shortterm money market fund which invests in securities issued or sponsored by the us government the value and liquidity of these marketable securities may fluctuate substantially and could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio instability in the global financial markets declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio geopolitical events or other factors any adverse changes in the financial markets and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 

  

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates timing of regulatory approvals and licenses litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

﻿ 

 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to local state regional and federal tax laws in the us and many other international jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation also we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings in the netherlands and switzerland are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

﻿ 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

﻿ 

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

﻿ 

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants  our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

﻿ 

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

  

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

﻿ 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10 ‑k  

﻿ 

we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form 10k in the  glossary of terms and selected abbreviations”   

﻿ 

description of business segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock  poultry and dairy “lpd”  our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diag nostics market “opti medical” with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic   areas 

﻿ 

during the second quarter of 2016 we renamed our customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems line of business in the cag segment to veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems financial results were not adjusted as a result of this name change 

﻿ 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we modified our management reporting to rename idexx vetlab service and accessories to cag diagnostics service and accessories and reclassified the location of snap pro service plans previously located in cag diagnostics capital  instruments to cag diagnostics service and accessories the amo unt of revenue reclassified was 05 million during the year ended december 31 2015 and 14 million during the year ended december 31 2016 the amount reclassified was less than 01 million during the year ended december 31 2014 

﻿ 

certain costs not allocated to our operating segments and are instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” these costs include costs that do not align with one of our existing operating segments or are cost prohibitive to allocate which primarily consist of our rd function regional or country expenses certain foreign currency revaluation gains and losses on monetary balances in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currency and unusual items corporate support function costs such as information technology facilities human resources finance and legal health benefits and incentive compensation are charged to our business segments at predetermined budgeted amounts or rates differences from these predetermined budgeted amounts or rates are captured within unallocated amounts 

﻿ 

effective january 1 2016 we modified our management reporting to the chief operating decision maker to provide a more comprehensive view of the performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization and subsequent recognition of variances between standard and actual manufacturing costs which adjusts the timing of cost recognition from when the variance is created to the period in which the related inventory is sold prior to january 1 2016 the capitalization and subsequent recognition of these variances were not allocated to our operating segments and were instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

﻿ 

 

the segment gross profit and income loss from operations within this annual report on form 10k for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 has been retrospectively revised to reflect the changes to our segment performance metrics described above the following is a summary of revised segment gross profit from operations for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 



﻿ 

﻿ 

the following is a summary of revised segment operating income loss from operations for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 

﻿ 

﻿ 



 

﻿ 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

﻿ 

companion animal group 

﻿ 

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by d oing so  we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

﻿ 

cag diagnostics   we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services v eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight 

  

the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution   to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and idexx vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 

﻿ 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once r evenues from the associated propri etary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid a ssay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature  in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services   our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits  have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

﻿ 

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 

﻿ 

prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received 

﻿ 

 

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumabl e sales as of december 31 2016 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 43000 units globally as compared to 40000 units globally in 2015  approximately 50 percent of 201 6   catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers  which leads to additional testing by the customer 

﻿ 

as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

﻿ 

the lasercyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 201 3  in addition we sell the procyte dx   lasercyte   and vetautoread an alyzers as of december 31 201 6  these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 31 000 units  as compared to 29000 units in 2015 and 27000 units in 2014 a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in 201 6  approximately 50 percent of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and a decrease in   the associated   recurring revenue stream  

﻿ 

our sedivue dx instrument which we launched in north america early in 2016 and in the uk and australia in the fourth quarter of 2016 is the first and only inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we provide customers with sedivue dx consumables that are charged upon utilization which we refer to as payperrun as compared to other instruments where we charge upon shipment of consumables we reported total revenues of 242 million from sedivue dx instrument and payperrun sale s during the year ended december 31   2016 

﻿ 

we seek to enhance the attractiveness and customer loyalty of our snap rapid assay tests  by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures  and saves images of the results and    in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record   beginning in january of 2017 with our proread software the snap pro mobile device will interpret results th ese features promote practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on th e snap pro screen or  in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the   snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and  in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

﻿ 

prior to 2014 the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution for screening thyroid disease cortisol bile acids and interpreting snap rapid assay tests upon the launch of the total thyroxine “t 4 ”   slide for use with our catalyst analyzers during 2015 we experienced a decline in snapshot dx placements we reported revenues of 11 million from snapshot dx placements during the year ended december 31 2016 which reflects approximately a 04 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we reported revenues of 15 million from snapshot dx during the year ended december 31 2015 which reflects approximately a 1 million decrease in revenue relative to the prior year we will continue to service the existing snapshot dx install   base  

 

our longterm success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic product and services is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues   our ability to realize price increases based on our differentiated products and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results  broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

﻿ 

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus  client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

﻿ 

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary idexx vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature for the year ended december 31 2016 recurring diagnostic revenue which is both highly durable and profitable accounts for approximately 72 percent of our consolidated revenue 

﻿ 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions  our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

﻿ 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument  our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes  as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians  additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers 

﻿ 

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once  including the ability to utilize our snap pro mobile device    we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

﻿ 

 

the expiration of a third party’s us lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of 2015 we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay s “elisa” technology  test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice 

﻿ 

we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of a unique and proprietary test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

﻿ 

profitability in our lab business is supported in part by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies  when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint   new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the implementation of our alldirect sales strategy in the us   and the subsequent growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years re curring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs our upfront customer loyalty programs associated with customer acquisitions provides incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of pr oducts or services including reference laboratory services   

﻿ 

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri has allowed us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market 

﻿

﻿ 

 

animana and neo are subscriptionbased saas practice management offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable recurring revenue stream while utilizing cloud technology instead of a client server platform while we continue to develop sell and support our licensedbased cornerstone and dvmax software we are growing our installed base of subscriptionbased practice management offerings for new customers of idexx practice management systems in time we expect that demand for neo our subscriptionbased saas practice management offering in north america will moderate customer growth of licensebased cornerstone placements we also believe that once established this subscriptionbased model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical licensebased placements our cornerstone and dvmax customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through enhanced diagnostic integrations and high value addon subscription services such as pet health network pro petly plans and credit card processing and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of all of our licensebased software offerings 

﻿ 

we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic idexx vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits

﻿ 

water 

﻿ 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices including drinking water supplies with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly v alue strong relationships and customer support we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers’ testing protocols  as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

﻿ 

 

livestock poultry and dairy 

﻿ 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate 

﻿ 

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages   the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business which also leverages the snap platform the dairy snap products incorpor ate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penet ration in dairy processor s   and develop product line enhancements and extensions

opti medical  our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals w e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

  

our facility in roswell georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte needs of the veterinary market  we leverage t his facility’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

﻿ 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review in march 2016 we discontinued certain development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market that were devoted to a new platform and focused our efforts on supporting our current generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer

critical accounting policies and estimates 

﻿ 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates o n an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

﻿ 

revenue recognition 

﻿ 

we recognize revenue when four criteria are m et i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2j  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

﻿ 

multiple element arrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers diagnostic imaging systems or practice management software  combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables rapid assay kits and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 

﻿ 

we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element  

﻿ 

 

when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

﻿ 

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

﻿ 

customer programs  we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 

﻿ 

customer loyalty programs  our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future 

﻿ 

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services our transition to an alldirect sales model in the us and the subsequent increase in competitive activity resulted in an increase in the rate of new upfront customer loyalty incentives predominantly in response to competitive offerings during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in 2015 we saw a slowing in the rate of increase for new upfront customer loyalty incentives beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continuing through 2016 

﻿ 

if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized within other current assets and other longterm assets and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 

﻿ 

 

idexx instrument marketing programs  our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program requiring us to apply judgment to estimate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 at december 31 201 6  a 5 percent change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 04 million 

﻿ 

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment or deferred within other assets and is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement 

﻿ 

idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 

﻿ 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice  differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

﻿ 

following is a summary of revenue reductions net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended december 31 201 6  201 5 and 201 4  in thousands

accrued customer programs are included within accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities depending on the anticipated settlement date in the consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form 10k following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and the ending accrued customer programs balance for t he years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  in thousands

﻿ 

inventory valuation 

﻿ 

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

﻿ 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

﻿ 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized 

﻿ 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

﻿ 

 

in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goo dwill impairment test the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

﻿ 

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment the regulatory environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating   performance 

﻿ 

in the fourth quarters of 201 6 and 201 5  we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units 

﻿ 

as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of our fourth quarter assessment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the company’s market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

﻿ 

we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical product line outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property under licensing agreements that expire in 2025 there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 76 million and 117 percent of the reporting unit’s carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately  8 00 million to 20 billion and 260 percent to 1220 percent of the reporting unit’s carrying value   

﻿ 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 201 6  201 5 or 201 4  

﻿ 

 

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate 

﻿ 

during 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review we discontinued our product development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market during and focused our commercial efforts in this market on supporting our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical line of business resulting from this change in strategy noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recorded within our condensed consolidated statement of operations within general and administration expenses during 2016 the intangibles associated with our opti medical human pointofcare medical diagnostics market are fully written off i ntangible assets impairments during th e years ended december 31 2015 and 2014    were not material 

﻿ 

our business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly surrounding the retention of customers during the postcombination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration arising from business acquisitions 

  

sharebased compensation 

﻿ 

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

  

 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during t he years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

﻿ 





﻿ 

changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 201 6 was 133 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 percent  the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 201 6 would have increased or decreased by approximately 04 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 201 6 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01   million 

﻿ 

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 201 6 would have increased or decreased by approximately  12 million  and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 201 6 for options awarded during 201 6 would have incre ased or decreased by approximately 02 million  

﻿ 

sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 201 6 was  199 million which is net of a reduction of  30 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

﻿ 

modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 201 6  201 5 or 201 4  

﻿ 

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued totaled 270 million for the year ended december 31 2016  2 56 million for the year ended december 31 2015 and  240 million for the year ended december 31 2014  the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 201 6 was 380 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years   

 

income taxes 

﻿ 

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

﻿ 

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 percent of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2016 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 

﻿ 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made      

﻿ 

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 0 3 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

﻿ 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us at december 31 2016 t he cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were  5467 million  of which approximately  3870 million was held in cash and cash equivalents no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate   the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 

﻿ 

 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 188 million as of december 31 2016 and 74 million as of december 31 2015 which includes estimated interest expense and penalties the increase in net liability is primarily related to two uncertain tax positions taken during the year the first relates to our claiming certain tax deductions under a recent court case but one that the irs has vowed to appeal the second relates to certain changes we made in our transfer pricing policies to better align statutory accounting with business operations see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

﻿ 

future changes in tax law could impact our provision for income taxes the amount of taxes payable and our us deferred tax liability balances any enacted legislation to reduce the us corporate tax rate would reduce our income tax expense and payments in subsequent periods but could also have a onetime impact in the period of enactment potential onetime impacts could include adjustments to our net us deferred tax liability and increased tax expense resulting from the taxation of operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries that have been indefinitely invested outside the us and for which we have not recorded a us tax liability 

﻿ 

results of operations and trends 

﻿ 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

﻿ 

distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the end users therefore we believe it is important to track sales to end users in the relevant periods by our significant distributors in order to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on our reported revenue in those periods effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us however changes in prior year us distributors’ inventory levels impacted 2015 reported growth results in certain countries internationally we continue to sell our products through third party distributors although we are unable to obtain data for sales to end users from certain less significant nonus third party distributors we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates in the relevant periods following our transition to an all direct us distribution approach we anticipate that changes in distributor inventory levels will have an immaterial impact on our growth in future years 

﻿ 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

  

effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services 

﻿ 

 

we incurred transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy in the us including approximately 5 million in incremental expense during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from the ramp up of sales and operating resources we also incurred 95 million in nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 associated with project management and other onetime costs required to implement this new strategy further we incurred onetime transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of 25 million and 21 million respectively in such period 

﻿ 

during the three months ended december 31 2014 we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and vetlab consumables upon delivery to end users in the us instead of at distribution we also began to capture additional revenue that was previously earned by our distribution partners net of other changes related to this alldirect strategy such as free nextday shipping and a new returns policy for expired product we refer to this net additional revenue as distributor margin capture this net incremental revenue allowed us to expand our sales marketing and customer support resources which we expect will drive future revenue growth and to build out our distribution capability we expect investments in these areas will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates and provide accretive benefits to operating profit also as a result of the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us we incurred additional working capital demands including inventory costs previously borne by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a longer elapsed time to collect our receivables 

﻿ 

currency impact  for the year ended december 31 201 6  approximately 21 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 2 0 percent   for the year ended december 31 2015 and 2 2 percent f or the year ended december 31 201 4  strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in us dollars and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see “part i item 1a risk factors” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts   

﻿ 

the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by   accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” otherwise referred to herein as a   nongaap financial measure as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we   believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’   ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods w e calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange   rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the   comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period 

﻿ 

effects of economic conditions  demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services 

  

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

﻿ 

effects of patent expiration  although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2016 and are expected to expire during 2017 the expiration of these patents or licenses  individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in item 1 “patents and licenses”

the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends 

  

the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations – currency impact ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period

companion animal group   

﻿ 

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag   

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our idexx vetlab consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services resulting from increased volumes and to a lesser extent higher realized prices 

﻿ 

idexx vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes in the us europe and the asiapacific region from our catalyst consumables and to a lesser extent procyte dx consumables resulting from growth in testing by existing customers   the acquisition of new customers and an expanded menu of available tests these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our vettest   chemistry instrument due to customer upgrades from our previous generation vettest to our catalyst analyzers idexx vetlab consumables revenue also benefited from higher average unit sales prices 

﻿ 

the increase in rapid assay revenue resulted from higher   average unit price and sales volumes of   snap 4dx and   higher sales volumes of   single analyte snap   products these favorable factors were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of lower average unit sales prices in the us for certain earlier generation rapid assay products 

﻿ 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from existing customers   and   the net acquisition of new customers   supported by our differentiated diagnostic technologies   such as   idexx sdma also revenue increased to a lesser extent from   higher average unit sales prices due to price   increases testing volumes benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year  

﻿ 

cag diagnostic services and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

﻿ 

  the increase in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue resulted from our newly launched sedivue dx analyzer which   contributed approximately 23   percent to reported and organic   instrument revenue growth and higher procyte dx revenues partly offset by lower catalyst revenues resulting from a shift in placements from our catalyst dx analyzer to our lower priced catalyst one analyzer and the prior year benefit of recognizing previously deferred revenues associated with preorders of our catalyst one analyzer in the us in 2014 

﻿ 

the increase in veterinary   software services and diagnostic imaging   systems revenue was due primarily to increasing diagnostic imaging systems revenue higher veterinary   subscription   service revenue including increases in our pet health network pro subscriber base and higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base   of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems   revenues from diagnostic imaging systems were higher due to the timing of revenue recognized from fewer deferred revenue placements under upfront customer loyalty programs as compared to the same period in the prior year and the recognition of previously deferred   revenues these favorable factors were partially offset by fewer licensedbased cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscriptionbased model for new practice management customer acquisitions as well as lower average unit sale prices on diagnostic imaging system placements 

﻿ 

water   the increase in water revenue as compared to the same period in the prior year was attributable to all regions in which we operate most notably from strong performance in north america europe and the asiapacific region higher revenues   resulted primarily from increased   sales volumes and price increases of our colilert test products and related accessories used in coliform and   e coli testing placements of our quantitray sealer plus instrument which we launched in june   2015 several large project orders during the first half of 2016 and to a   lesser extent from higher sales volumes of our products designed to detect   cryptosporidium related to an outbreak in the united kingdom   beginning in mid2015 through the first half of   2016 testing volumes   also   benefited slightly from favorable weather trends experienced during the first quarter of 2016   as compared to the same period of the prior year 

﻿ 

livestock poultry and dairy   the increase in lpd organic revenue resulted from strong performance in emerging markets most notably resulting from higher sales volumes of swine poultry and bovine pregnancy products and services in various regions this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of bovine testing products within western europe in large part due to the success of certain disease eradication programs in the region as well as pressure on our dairy testing business due to a decline in worldwide milk prices  

  

 

other   the increase in other revenue was due primarily to royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line partially offset by   lower sales volumes of our opti medical blood gas analyzers and related consumables     

  

gross profit 

﻿ 

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

﻿ 



﻿ 

gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes   partly offset   by a 70 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year excluding currency impacts of approximately 118 basis points gross margins increased moderately supported by improvements in our cag business 

﻿ 

companion animal group     gross profit for   cag   increased due to higher sales volumes along with a 10 basis point increase in the gross profit percentage during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year the unfavorable impact of currency during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately 90 basis points resulting primarily from lower hedging gains excluding currency impacts gross margins increased moderately supported by the net benefit of price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic services and idexx vetlab consumables and profitability improvements from higher relative revenue of our expanded subscription service offerings and within our worldwide network of reference laboratories 

﻿ 

water     gross profit for water increased due to higher sales volumes offset by a 180 basis point reduction in the gross profit percentage the unfavorable impact of currency during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately 210 basis points resulting from lower hedging gains and changes in foreign currency exchange rates excluding currency impacts the gross profit percentage increased slightly due to the net benefit of price increases on our colilert testing products and related accessories 

﻿ 

livestock poultry and dairy     gross profit for lpd decreased due to a reduction in the gross profit percentage of 460 basis points for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period of the prior year the decrease in the gross profit percentage resulted primarily from approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable currency impact primarily due to lower relative hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2016   as compared to the same period of the prior year additionally higher overall manufacturing costs which were partially offset by the expiration of royalties   on certain of our swine testing products  resulted in an overall lower gross profit as compared to the same period in the prior year 

﻿ 

other   gross profit for other   increased due to   higher sales   and an increase   in the   gross profit percentage of 340 basis points for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year the increase in the gross profit percentage   resulted primarily from   higher relative royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property related to our former pharmaceutical product line partly offset by an increase in   overall opti medical   product costs 

﻿   

 

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts decreased due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” the increase in personnelrelated costs was due primarily to higher selfinsured healthcare costs and higher than budgeted employee incentives reported within unallocated amounts during the year ended december 31 2016   as compared to the same period of the prior year

﻿ 

the increase in sales and marketing expense for the   year ended   december   31 2016 was due to higher commercial   infrastructure investments within emerging markets   the increase in general and administrative expense   resulted primarily from higher investments in emerging markets including brazil the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher external product development and material costs   all the increases above were partially   offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

﻿ 

other     operating expenses for other which totaled 107 million for the year ended   december 31 2016 increased 03   million   as compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to   intangible impairments within our opti medical business partly offset by   lower amortization expense on the aforementioned intangible assets and a reduction in personnelrelated costs 

﻿ 

during the first half of 2016 management reviewed the opti medical product offerings as a result of this review we discontinued our product development activities in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market during march 2016 and focused our commercial efforts in this market on supporting our latest generation opti ccats2 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer management identified unfavorable trends in our opti medical line of business resulting from this change in strategy we revised our forecasts downward causing us to assess the realizability of the related tangible and intangible assets and determined the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value   of the opti medical asset group noncash intangible asset impairments of 22 million were recorded during the year ended december 31 2016 

  

unallocated amounts   operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 76 million to 145 million for the year ended december 31 2016 due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs as compared to budget reflecting increased employee incentives and higher selfinsured health claim expenses as well as certain foreign exchange losses on monetary assets due to strengthening of the us dollar this compares to prior 

 

period cost control initiatives that resulted in lower than budgeted costs we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” partially offsetting these increases was the aforementioned   82 million impairment charge recorded in 2015 related to   internallydeveloped software not yet placed into service as a result of a strategic shift to refocus our development efforts within our veterinary software and services business 

﻿ 

interest income and interest expense 

﻿ 

interest income was 37 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 25 million for   the same period in the prior year the increase in interest income was due primarily to a larger relative portfolio of marketable securities during the year ended december 31 2016 and to a lesser extent higher interest rates as compared to the same period of the prior year 

  

interest expense   was 320 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 292 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense resulted from higher relative interest incurred in 2016 as a result of approximately 250 million in senior notes that we issued and sold through private placements during the first half of 2015 for which fixed interest rates range from 1785 percent to 372 percent additionally the increase in interest expense was due to higher relative interest rates on our credit facility see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes and credit facility 

﻿ 

provision for income taxes 

﻿ 

our effective income tax rate was 310 percent for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 297 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily related to a change in earnings mix in 2016 with relatively higher earnings subject to domestic tax rates as opposed to lower international tax rates including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates

the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our vetlab consumables and our reference laboratory diagnostic services resulting from both increased volumes as well as higher realized prices from distributor margin capture relating to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us the impact of the 2014 drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels increased reported cag diagnostics recurring revenue growth by 3 percent 

﻿ 

idexx vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes resulting from growth in testing from existing customers and an expanded menu of available tests including our new t 4 test additionally we benefitted from higher average unit sales prices due primarily to distributor margin capture relating to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us the impact of the 2014 drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels increased reported consumables revenue growth by 5 percent 

﻿ 

the increase in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to impacts related to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us including higher average unit sales prices resulting from distributor margin capture and the impact of the drawdown of inventory held by distributors during the fourth quarter of 2014 which increased 2015 reported revenue growth by 8 percent to a lesser extent we also benefitted from higher canine snap 4dx plus sales volumes these favorable factors were partly offset by the impact of competitive losses on certain earlier generation rapid assay products in the us in the first half of 2015 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from existing customers and the net acquisition of new customers additionally the increase in revenue was the result of higher average unit sales prices due to price increases

﻿ 

the increase in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was due primarily to higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems and higher revenues from other customer information management services and an increasing pet health network pro subscriber base these favorable factors were partly offset by fewer cornerstone placements and the unfavorable impact of increased diagnostic imaging system placements under upfront customer loyalty programs for which the consideration and related revenue is deferred and recognized over future periods which resulted in an overall decrease in diagnostic imaging system sales during the third quarter of 2015 we launched idexx neo practice management software a saas practice management system in north america under this delivery model we provide hosted software in the cloud on a subscription basis 

﻿ 

  water the increase in water revenue was distributed across all major regions and resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of our colilert and related accessories used in our coliform and e coli testing placements of our quantitray sealer plus instrument which we launched in june 2015 and increased sales of our products designed to detect cryptosporidium 

﻿ 

livestock poultry and dairy the increase in lpd organic revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of certain bovine tests poultry and swine tests most prominently in the asiapacific region and europe and to a lesser degree in the us and latin america these favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in herd health screening in the asiapacific region

on december 18 2015 the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was passed 2015 path act the 2015 path act provided a retroactive and permanent extension of the us research and development “rd” tax credit as a result we recorded the entire 2015 tax benefit during the three months ended december 31 2015 as the rd tax credit was available for both the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 it did not have a significant impact on changes in our fullyear effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources 

﻿ 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available on our 850 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility under an amended and restated credit agreement that we executed in december 2015 the “credit facility” in addition we issued 150 million of senior notes in february 2015 and € 889 million of eurodenominated senior notes in june 2015 during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we purchased marketable debt securities using a portion of our cash balances at de cember 31 2016 we had 3918 million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as compared to 3426 million on december 31 2015 and 3225 million on december 31 2014  working capital including our credit facility totaled negative 890 million at december 31 2016 as compared to negative 351 million at december 31 2015 and negative 615 million at december 31 2014 additionally at december 31 201 6  we had remainin g borrowing availability of 238 million under our 850 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents our portfolio of shortduration marketable securities funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our business as currently conducted 

﻿ 

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash and marketable securities are generall y available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

﻿ 

the following table presents cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries 

﻿

﻿ 

these foreign held amounts are subject to material repatriation tax effects we held marketable securities with effective maturities of two years or less that had an average a a credi t rating as of december 31 2016    

 

the following table presents marketable securities at fair value for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015

﻿ 

we did not have any marketable securities in 2014 

﻿ 

of the 1549 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2016 76 percent was held as bank deposits 22 percent was invested in money market funds   restricted to us government and agency securities and the remainder consisted of commercial paper   and other securities   with original maturities of less than ninety days of the 1290 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2015 85 percent was held as bank deposits 6 percent was invested in money market funds   restricted to us government and agency securities 6 percent was invested in money market funds   invested in highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities and   the remainder   consisted of commercial paper   and agency bonds   with original maturities of less than ninety days 

﻿ 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates

sources and uses of cash 

﻿ 

the following table presents cash provided used   

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities of  1182 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year period  was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities as well as an increase in net income including increases in noncash charges  primarily related to deferred taxes and depreciation and amortization  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of  195 million for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the prior year period  was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by an increase in net income including increases in n oncash charges  primarily related to depreciation and amortization and an impairment charge in 2015  

﻿ 

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014    

﻿ 



﻿ 

the reduction in cash used by accounts receivable for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily due to the absence of the impacts related to our change in us commercial strategy impacting the first quarter of 2015 the incremental cash used by accounts receivable for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to our transition to an alldirect strategy in the us including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our us endusers that previously purchased from our us distribution partners which take a longer elapsed time to collect additionally accounts receivable is impacted by increasing revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 relative to the prior periods including the margin capture associated with the aforementioned alldirect strategy in contrast we received the benefit of collecting the final accounts receivable from our us distribution partners during december 2014 

﻿ 

the net incremental cash provided by inventories for 2016 was primarily due to operational initiatives to optimize inventory levels following a period of inventory growth to support new products and increasing demand   cash used by inventories for 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to growth in our volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher inventory levels to support new instrument and diagnostic test launches 

﻿ 

the cash provided by deferred revenue for the year ended december 31 20 16 as compared to cash used for the same period in 2015  was primarily due to sales under our catalyst one   introductory offer  that was introduced in 2014 and increased cash provided by deferred revenue during 2014 the amount of deferred revenue for 2015 and 2016 returned to typical operating levels prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received 

﻿ 

the decrease in cash provided by other assets and liabilities for the   year ended december 31 2016 was the result of higher taxable income in 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year income tax payments were lower during 2015 resulting from onetime impacts of implementing our us alldirect strategy and the benefit from the tax increase prevention act enactment late in the fourth quarter of 2014 the net incremental cash provided by other assets and liabilities for 2015 was also due to the recognition of previously deferred catalyst instrument costs under the catalyst one introductory offer during 2015 these factors were partly offset by the incremental cash used for personnelrelated accruals including higher relative payments related to employee incentive programs and higher payments for other accruals due to increases in expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 2014 

﻿ 

 

tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements is the result of taxes from the vesting of restricted stock units and exercises of stockoptions this amount will fluctuate based on stock price as compared to the strike prices of stock options as well as employees timing of exercises 

﻿ 

  we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

﻿ 

investing activities  cash used by investing activities was  908 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to  3084 million used for the year ended december 31 2015 and 804 million used for the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease in cash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 as well as the increase in cash used for the year ended december 31 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities in 2015  

﻿ 

our total capital expenditure plan for 201 7 is estimated to be approximately  9 0 million which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

﻿ 

financing activities cash used by financing activities was 2178 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to  956 million used for the year ended december 31 2015    and 10 34 million used for the year ended december 31 2014  the in crease in cash used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was due to the issuance of senior notes in 2015 as well as a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock the   decrease in cash used by financing activities for year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 was due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock the aggregate issuance of approximately 250 million of senior notes during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 200 million of senior notes issued during the same period in 2014 as well as lower relative net borrowings under the credit facility during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014 

﻿ 

in june 2015 we entered into an amended and restated multicurrency note purchase and private shelf agreement the “2015 amended agreement” among the company prudential investment management inc “prudential” and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein which amends and restates the note purchase and private shelf agreement dated july 21 2014 pursuant to the 2015 amended agreement we issued and sold through a private placement a principal amount of €889 million of 1785 series c senior notes due june 18 2025 the “2025 series c notes” we used the net proceeds from this issuance and sale of the 2025 series c notes for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under our credit facility 

﻿

cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by  979 million during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015  cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by 2162 million during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2016  we have repurchased 613 million shares during the year ended december 31 2016 we purchased 31 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3131 million as compared to purchases of 57 million shares for an aggregate cost of 4064 million during 2015 and purchases of 98 million shares for an aggregate cost of 6182 million during 2014 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share   repurchases 

﻿ 

as noted above we refinanced our existing 700 million credit facility during december 2015 increasing the principal amount there under to 850 million the credit facility matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 2020 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 1250 to 1375 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate based on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0375 percent based on our leverage ratio

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

﻿ 

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manuf acturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us or in us dollars  but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended dece mber 31 201 6  approximately 2 1 percent of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 20 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 and 22 percent for the year ended december 31 2014   the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for three of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands  singapore and dubai  the functional currency is the us dollar   

﻿ 

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and exp enses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is di fferent from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projecte d revenues and expenses for 2017  excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 1 percent strengthening of the us dollar would reduce revenue by approximately 7 million and oper ating income by approximately  3 million  additionally our foreign currency hedge contract s in place as of december 31 2016 would provide incremental offsetting gains of approximately 1 million  the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded a s they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

﻿ 

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a stronger us dollar will have a n adverse effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year ending december 31 2017  by approximately 2 6 million 8 million and 006 per share respectively this unfavorable impact includes foreign currency hedging activity which is expected to increase total company operating profit by approximately  3 million and diluted earnings per share by 00 3 in the year ending december 31 2017 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 106 the british pound at 123 the canadian dollar at 075 the australian dollar at 075 and the japanese yen at ¥117 to the us dollar for the full year of 2017 

﻿ 

the following table is the foreign currency exchange impacts on our revenues operating profit and diluted earning s per share for the years dec ember 31 2016 2015 and 2014 as compared to the respective prior periods 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge 

 

are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

﻿ 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year    from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

﻿ 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2016  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended decem ber 31 2016 2015 and 2014  our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

﻿ 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 percent of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase s and sales t otaled  1759 million at december 31 2016 and  1761   million at dec ember 31 2015  at december 31 2016 we had  54 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of related tax expense   

﻿ 

we have a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of  850 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4  20 20    “credit facility” and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date alt hough the credit facility does not mature until december   4  20 20  all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 201 6 were  611 0 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 195 percent  based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 201 6  an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 percent would increase interest expense by approximately  61 million on an annualized basis   

﻿ 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we purchased marketable debt securities which are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report on form 10k the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2016 we estimate that a 1 percent increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately 09 million

 item 1 business 

  

we are a delaware corporation incorporated in 1983 we develop manufacture and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary  livestock and poultry dairy and water testing m arkets we also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market our primary products and services are 

  















  

 

description of business by segment 

  

we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock  poultry and dairy “lpd”  our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diag nostics market “opti medical” with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments   

  

the performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally for the year ended december 31 2015 sales of products and services to customers outside the us accounted for approximately 39 of our overall revenue these foreign sales accounted for approximately 33 50 and 89 of revenue in our cag water and lpd segments respectively see “part 1 item 1a risk factors” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report on f orm 10k for more information about our segments and revenue from customers outside of the us 

  

companion animal group 

  

cag provides to veterinarians diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions that enhance the health and wellbeing of pets  the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services comprise a unique competitive advantage that we refer to as the idexx diagnostic advantage providing veterinarians with the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care the idexx diagnostic advantage improves staff efficiencies and also enables the veterinarian to communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner which ultimately leads to growing practice revenues 

  

cag diagnostics 

  

we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services regardless of modality utilized veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies the result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner 

  

 

integrated diagnostic information management 

  

vetconnect plus is a cloudbased technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ data from all of idexx’s diagnostic modalities these integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patientspecific testing results allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results enabling greater medical insight and enhanced decision making  in addition vetconnect plus provides instant mobile or browserbased access to results which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians in this way vetconnect plus can aid veterinarian s and practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient’s care which can support greater compliance with medical recommendations or preventive care protocols vetconnect plus is currently available in north america australia new zealand japan israel and i n numerous countrie s throughout europe 

  

inclinic diagnostic solutions 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our idexx vetlab suite of inclinic chemistry hematology immunoassay urinalysis and coagulation analyzers associated proprietary consumable products that provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results and a broad range of singleuse handheld idexx snap   rapid assay test kits that provide quick accurate and convenient pointofcare diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions 

  

the idexx vetlab suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products all of which are described below additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

  

blood and urine chemistry  we sell three chemistry analyzers the catalyst dx   chemistry analyzer the catalyst one chemistry analyzer and the vettest chemistry analyzer that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions these three instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” based on ortho’s dry slide technology in addition the catalyst dx and the catalyst one analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by opti medical systems inc “opti medical systems” one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and other slides also manufactured by idexx blood tests commonly run on these analyzers in clude glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin calcium creatinine blood urea nitrogen total protein and many others  tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels all three analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the detection of renal disease   

  

the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers provide significantly improved throughput ease of use and test menu relative to the vettest analyzer our original chemistry analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes phenobarbital fructosamine and total thyroxine “ t 4 ” key easeofuse features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system these analyzers also enable automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the catalyst dx and catalyst one run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum a nd urine in addition the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers run a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood allowing veterin arians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently  our fructosamine test helps veterinarians to diagnose and manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus helping to assess insulin treatments and adjust insulin dosages we launched our total t 4 test globally for use on the catalyst one analyzer during the first quarter of 2015 and for use on the catalyst dx analyzer early in the third quarter of 2015 t 4 testing is essential to assessing and managing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets 

  

 

the catalyst one analyzer launched in november 2014 is engineered to deliver the same laboratoryquality results and realtime work flow as the catalyst dx analyzer offering an attractive inhouse chemistry option when a single sample drawer is sufficient for a clinic’s workflow requirements the catalyst one analyzer currently offers an expanding menu of 30 tests including tests for thyroid disease kidney disease diabetes and therapeutic drug monitoring 

  

we also have two other chemistry analyzers the vetlyte electrolyte analyzer and the vetstat electrolyte and blood gas analyzer the vetstat analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that are manufactured by our opti medical systems business  

  

sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of idexx vetlab equipment 

  

hematology  we sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also called a complete blood count these analyzers include the procyte dx   hematology analyzer the first and only inhouse analyzer to combine laserflow cytometry optical fluorescence and laminarflow impedance in its analysis the original lasercyte hematology analyzer and next generation lasercyte dx hematology analyzer launched in 2013 which both use laserflow cytometry technology in their analysis and the idexx vetautoread hematology analyzer our original hematology analyzer in addition the procyte dx   hematology analyzer the lasercyte dx he matology analyzer and the lasercyte hematology analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids we also sell the coag dx analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders  

  

the procyte dx   analyzer our premier hematology analyzer provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the lasercyte lasercyte dx and vetautoread hematology analyzers the procyte dx an alyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells for a more complete picture of a patient’s health the procyte dx is validated for ten companion animal species canine feline equine bovine ferret rabbit gerbil pig guinea pig and mini pig with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species 

  

immunoassay testing instruments  during the first quarter of 2014 we launched the snap pro mobile d evice  whic h automatically activates a snap test properly times the run and captures an image of the result this device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results on the snap pro mobile screen or via vetconnect plus  in addition the snap pro mobile d evice improves staff efficiency and ensures that all snap test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing 

  

with multiplepatient testing functionality the snapshot dx analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total t 4  cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function respectively the snapshot dx a nalyzer also reads interprets and records the results of many idexx rapid assay snap tests including our canine snap   4dx plus test   feline snap fivfelv combo test canine snap   cpl test feline snap   fpl test snap feline triple test and canine snap   heartworm rt test 

  

urinalysis  early in 2016 we plan to launch sedivue dx in north america sedivue dx is the first and only inclinic urine sediment analyzer designed to provide automated realtime results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis sedivue dx brings automation speed and consistency to urinalysis a traditionally laborious and variable process its leadingedge technology allows veterinary staff to perform a complete urinalysis in approximately 3 minutes sedivue dx uses proprietary image processing algorithms similar to facial recognition technology to identify clinically relevant particles found in urine and to capture highcontrast digital images that become part of the permanent patient record the i dexx vetlab ua analyzer provides rapid automated capture of semiquantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use 

  

 

idexx vetlab station  the idexx vetlab station “ivls” connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the idexx vetlab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capabili ty ivls securely connects to the i nternet and in this way enables idexx to perform through its smartservice solutions wireless services  remote instrument service and software updates to ivls and certain connected instruments ivls also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to vetconnect plus  we sell ivls as an integral component of the catalyst dx catalyst one l asercyte dx and procyte dx   analyzers  snap pro mobile device and also as a standalone hardware platform the ivls includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers ivls also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the idexx vetlab suite stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap test results and sends and receives information from practice management systems including the idexx cornerstone system as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems   

  

the snap rapid a ssays are singleuse handheld test kits that can work without the use of instru mentation although many kits may also be read and recorded au tomatically by the snapshot dx a nalyzer or activated and captured automa tically by the snap pro mobile d evice as discu ssed above the principal snap rapid a ssay tests are as follows   

  

singleuse canine tests  













sales of canine vectorborne disease tests including snap 4dx plus   and snap heartworm rt are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice 

  

singleuse feline tests

marketing and distribution 

  

we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing customer service sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in all major regions including africa asia pacific canada europe and latin america 

  

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical s ervice requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors effective january 1 2015 we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the us prior to januar y 1 2015    w e   market ed our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary   distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by distributors outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide generally through our direct sales force we market our diagnostic imaging products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada we market our software products primarily through our direct sales force in the us canada europe and australia we market our water and lpd products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force we sell our opti electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti products primarily through distributors and other resellers 

  

research and development 

  

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and external consulting and development costs were 997 million 983 million and 880 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively or 62 66 and 64 of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

patents and licenses 

  

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the company based on a variety of factors including providing protection for the company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property affording protection from competitors in certain markets enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our product s and offerings strengthening the company’s reputation and standing among customers employees and key suppliers and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters imitators and other copiers of technologies 

  

 

important patents and licenses include 



















  

while we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to the company  a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position these factors include our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments although the company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2015 and are expected to expire during 2016 and 2017 the expiration of these patents  individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations in addition  we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights  

  

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

production and supply 

  

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers 

  

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include catalyst dx and catalyst one   consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine and t 4 slides vetlyte consumables lasercyte   and lasercyte dx co nsumables vettest vetautoread and procyte dx analyzers and consumables  sedivue dx urinalysis instrument and components of our snap pro mobile device 

  

vettest and catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest   and catalyst chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to idexx 

  

 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain diagnostic   imaging systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

  

certain components incorporated into our snap products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing 

  

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

backlog 

  

we do not generally maintain significant backlog orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

  

competition 

  

we compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures se veral of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

  





 





  

government regulation 

  

many of ou r products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

  

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 

  

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “ fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 

  

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity marking for their products 

  

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

 

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

  

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

  

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and we are also subject to antibribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and import and export laws and regulations including us import and export control and sanctions laws a ny acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food safety medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report 

  

our business lines are highly competitive and our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a material negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

  



  



  



  





  



  



  



  



  



  



  

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

  

 

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

  

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 

  

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables vetlyte electrolyte consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories sedivue dx urine sediment analyzer image capture plates used in our diagnostic imaging systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap   rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device catalyst one lasercyte   and lasercyte dx hematology analyzer s livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and water testing products to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

  

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

  

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets through the development of new technology the acquisition of rights to use existing technologies or the use of existing technologies when patents protecting such existing technologies expire new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products we historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former us distribution partners and two of our previously exclusive us distribution partners joined a third former us distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014 the promotion and sale of our competitors’ products by our former us distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

  

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture market import export or sell our products and damage to our reputation 

  

 

consolidation in our customer base including through increased corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

  

veterinarians are our primary customers for our cag products and services and the us veterinary industry has been consolidating in recent years the number of owners of veterinary hospitals has been declining and an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include mars petcare owner of banfield pet hospitals and blue pearl veterinary partners national veterinary associates and vca antech inc a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies or those that establish other affiliations with these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

  

our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

  

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

  

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

  

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european union’s standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection 

we offer products and services that collect and use data provided by client practices and individuals  including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone and neo  online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various idexx websites and collect contact and other personally identifiable information from our customers and visitors to our websites 

  federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personally identifiable information including data that we receive from our employees customers vendors and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions including requiring local storage and processing of data these laws and regulations continue to develop are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 

  for example on october 6 2015 the court of justice of the european union decided that the euus safe harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 which allowed transfers of personal data to the us in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws was invalid   on february 2 2016 us and european commission officials announced they had agreed upon a framework for a new data sharing agreement called the euus privacy shield to replace the euus safe harbor framework we are evaluating the potential impact of these changes to our business and practices and determining which of the multiple legal mechanisms available we will utilize to lawfully transfer personal data to the us in compliance with eu data protection laws   

the costs associated with compliance with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future and as a result may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

  

we are a global business with 39 of our revenue during the year ended december 31 2015 attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside of the us any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against foreign currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen australian dollar and brazilian real adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales and profits that are made in those currencies the strengthening of the us dollar has a greater adverse effect on the profits from products manufactured or sourced in us dollars that are exported to international markets and a lesser effect on profits from foreign sourced products and services due to a natural hedge from international expenses denominated in the correspo nding foreign currencies for the year ended dece mber 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the year s ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively   a strengthening u s dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars as well as affect our overall competitiveness in international markets the accumulated impacts from any continued longerterm growth in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our foreign currency hedging activities see note 17 — hedging instruments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements which are designed to minimize and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently offset the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates on our financial results over the limited time the hedges are in place we primarily hedge intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc other foreign currency exposures related to foreign sourced services and emerging markets may not be practical to hedge in certain cases these exposures are not offset by foreign currency denominated costs as we primarily use foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months and enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions on a quarterly basis for the current and following year the effectiveness of our foreign currency hedging activities to offset longerterm appreciation in the value of the us dollar against nonus currencies may be limited factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales and other forecasts volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only temporarily reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also temporarily reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by a strengthening value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenues by approximately 897 million due primarily to the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against all major foreign currencies in which we conduct business additionally our operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 were reduced by 212 million and 016 per share respectively which are net of offsetting gains of 209 million and 016 per share respectively from our foreign currency hedging activities   

  

at our current foreign exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the effect of a stronger us dollar will have a material adverse effect on our operating results by decreasing our revenues operating profit and diluted earnings per share in the year end ing december 31 2016 by approximately 40 million 31 million and 026 per share respectively   this unfavorable impact is net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains which are expected to increase total company operating profit by 8 million and diluted earnings per share by 006 in the year ending december 31 2016 the actual impact of changes in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact may materially differ from our expectations described above   the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 107 the british pound at 141 the canadian dollar at 068 the australian dollar at 068 and the japanese yen at ¥118 to the us dollar for the full year of 2016 

  

 

a weak worldwide economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales or decrease in sales growth of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

  

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

  

for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 39 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 43 and 42 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market import export sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport restrictions duties and licensing requirements natural disasters unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors or changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

  

 

our business sells many products through distributors which present risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we sell many of our products outside of the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

  

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

  

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters system disruptions and security breaches 

  

the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

  

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  

 

we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records analyze results of operations process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses we process credit card payments electronically over secure networks any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if we were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

  

risks associated with fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio 

  

we invest our surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities including corporate bonds commercial paper and a shortterm money market fund which invests in securities issued or sponsored by the us government the value and liquidity of these marketable securities may fluctuate substantially and could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates downgrades of the bonds and other securities included in our portfolio instability in the global financial markets declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities included in our portfolio geopolitical events or other factors any adverse changes in the financial markets and resulting declines in the value of our portfolio could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

  

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 

  

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates timing of regulatory approvals and licenses litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

  

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to local state regional and federal tax laws in the us and many other international jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation also we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings in the netherlands and switzerland are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results 

  

 

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

  

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants  our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

  

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

  

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations amounts available under our credit facility and senior note financings if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

description of segments  we operate primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food which we refer to as livestock  poultry and dairy “lpd”  our other operating segment combines and presents products for the human pointofcare medical diag nostics market “opti medical” with our pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

  

prior to january 1 2015 our cag segment included certain livestock testing services processed within our cag reference laboratories we have transitioned the responsibility for these diagnostic services from our cag segment to our lpd segment to more effectively align our business with the nature and customers of these livestock services segment revenue and income from operations for years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 have been retrospectively revised in this annual report on form 10k to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments   revenue related to these livestock diagnostic services was 138 million and 99 million for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively for the year ended december 31 2014 this reclassification of revenue between segments increases our lpd organic revenue growth as compared to previously reported numbers by 29 and decreases our cag cag diagnostic recurring and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services organic revenue growth rates as compared to previously reported numbers by 03 04 and 08 respectively see the subsection below titled “results of operations” for a description of the calculation of organic revenue growth 

  

certain costs are not allocated to our oper a ting segments and are instead reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” our business segments generally have limited control over the timing and amount of these expenses the major categories of these costs include 

  

gross profit 

  



  

operating expenses  

  







  

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

 

companion animal group 

  

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by d oing so  we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

  

cag diagnostics we refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the idexx diagnostic advantage we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarian’s diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories v eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight 

  

the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution   to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our current annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 

  

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once r evenues from the associated propri etary idexx vetlab consumables snap rapid a ssay test kits reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments and our snap pro mobile device are recurring in nature  in that they are regularly purchased by our customers typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services   our recurring revenues most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits  have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales therefore the mix of recurring and nonrecurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

  

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 

  

prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which was fully recognized in 2015 upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx was received 

  

 

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumabl e sales as of december 31 2015 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 40000 units globally  almost half of 2015 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a new or competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental recurring revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior test menu capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst analyzers  which leads to additional testing by the customer 

  

as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

  

the procyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte dx   and lasercyte   analyzers and vetautoread an alyzers as of december 31 2015 these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 29000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer in 2015 nearly half of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2015 a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were recertified instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of recurring revenue stream  

  

our sedivue instrument which we plan to launch in north america early in 2016 is the first and only inclinic analyzer to provide urine sediment analysis this instrument and singleuse consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the inhouse process of examining urine under a microscope we anticipate reported revenues of approximately 20 million in 2016 resulting from sedivue instrument placements and the resulting recurring revenue stream  

  

we seek to enhance the attractiveness of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and    in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on th e snap pro screen or  in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the   snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and  in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

  

prior to 2014 the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution which screened for thyroid disease upon the launch of the total thyroxine “t 4 ”   slide for use with our catalyst analyzers during 2015 we experienced a decline in snapshot dx placements we reported revenues of 15 million from snapshot dx during the year ended december 31 2015 which reflects approximately a 1 million decrease in revenue relative to prior year we will continue to service the existing snapshot dx install base  

  

 

our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention of their recurring revenues and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

  

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus  client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

  

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are considered recurring in nature recurring diagnostic revenue accounts for approximately 72  of our consolidated revenue and is both highly durable and profitable 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions  our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

  

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument  our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry hematology and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes  as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians  additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse superior performance sensitivity specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  

 

the expiration of a third party’s us lateral flow patent in early 2015 enabled competitors to launch single use tests that competed with several of our early generation snap rapid assay products including heartworm rt fivfelv combo test feline triple parvo and giardia these companies partnered with several of our former national distributors to gain market share by competing primarily on price in the second half of the year we stabilized our market share on these products in part by communicating the significant superiority in test sensitivity for both our canine and feline lines over competing tests using the lateral flow platform and in part with more effective marketing and promotion programs our higher sensitivity in the detection of infectious diseases is due in part to our snap platform which is unique in using elisa technology test accuracy through specificity and sensitivity is a primary factor that customers value with these inhouse tests given the importance of detecting the presence of serious infectious diseases in the practice 

  

we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

  

profitability in our lab business is supported by our expanding business scale globally profit improvements reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve efficiencies  when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits resulting from our alldirect sales strategy in the us will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years re curring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs under these arrangeme nts we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of pr oducts or services  

  

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market 

  

customer information management and di agnostic imaging systems  our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers within the north american australian and european markets cornerstone dvmax animana and neo practice management systems provide superior integrated information solution backed by exceptional customer support and education these practice management systems allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we market cornerstone dvmax and neo to customers primarily in north america and australia we market animana to customers primarily throughout europe 

  

 

animana and neo are subscriptionbased saas practice management offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable recurring revenue stream while we continue to sell and support cornerstone and dvmax software we anticipate that demand for neo our subscriptionbased saas practice management offering will moderate future revenue growth from new licensedbased cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscriptionbased model for new customer acquisitions of idexx practice management systems we believe that once established this subscriptionbased model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical licensebased placements our cornerstone and dvmax customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through enhanced diagnostic integrations and high value addon subscription services such as pet health network pro petly plans and credit card processing and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of our licensedbased offerings 

  

we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits 

  

our diagnostic imaging s ystems offer a convenient diagnostic imaging solution that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 

  

water 

  

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly v alue strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products ou tside of the us represented 50  of total wat er product sales in 201 5  and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

  

livestock poultry and dairy 

  

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance of this business can fluctuate 

  

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages   the snap platform as well as the manufacturing equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penet ration in dairy processor s   and develop product line enhancements and extensions  

  

 

we also distribute food safety products including a wide range of cost effective sensitive and reproducible diagnostic assays for the detection of multiple contaminants we believe distributing food safety products complements our livestock and dairy testing products 

  

in 2015 approximately 89 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe china and australia the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally  see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other 

  

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals w e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

  

our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

  

in 2015 approximately 84 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably asia and europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally  see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates o n an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when four criteria are m et i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2j  to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

  

 

multiple e lement a rrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx ve tlab suite of analyzers diagnostic imaging systems or practice management software  combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idex x vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 

  

we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element  

  

when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

  

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

  

customer p rograms  we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credit s or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 

  

 

customer loyalty programs  our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized r evenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future 

  

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services our transition to an alldirect sales model and the subsequent increase in competitive activity resulted in an increase in the rate of new upfront customer loyalty incentives predominantly in response to competitive offerings during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in 2015 we saw a slowing in the rate of increase for new up  front customer loyalty incentives in the fourth quarter of 2015 

  

if a custom er breaches its agreement it is required to refund all or a portion of the upfront cash or idexx points or make other repayments remedial actions or both  these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized within other current assets and other longterm assets and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase i dexx vetlab instruments diagnostic imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 201 5  201 4 and 201 3  impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 

  

idexx instrument   marketing programs  our instrument   marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument   marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program    requiring us to apply judgment to estimate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 201 5  201 4 and 201 3 at december 31 2015  a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximat ely 04 million 

  

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is capitalized within property and equipment and is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement 

  

idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and s ervices or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers  on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for t he years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  

  

 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to predict the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice  differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

  

following is a summary of revenue reductions net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended december 31 201 5  201 4 and 201 3  in thousands  

  



  



  

accrued customer programs are included within accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities depending on the anticipated settlement date in the consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form 10k following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and the ending accrued customer programs balance for t he years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013  in thousands  

  





  

inventory valuation 

  

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

  

 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized 

  

our business combinations regularly include contingent consideration arrangements that require additional consideration to be paid based on the achievement of established objectives most commonly surrounding the retention of customers during the post  combination period we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the post  combination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved with changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of contingent consideration and differences arising upon settlement were not material during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingent consideration arising from recent business acquisitions 

  

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

  

in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goo dwill impairment test the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

  

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

  

 

in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units 

  

as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of september 30  2015 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the company’s market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates 

  

we maintain approximately 65 million of goodwill associated with our remaining pharmaceutical product line outlicensing arrangements and certain retained drug delivery technologies collectively “pharmaceutical activities” that we seek to commercialize through arrangements with third parties currently our primary support for the carrying value of this goodwill is royalty revenue associated with the commercialization of certain intellectual property under licensing agreements that expire in 2025 there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase revenues from our remaining pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test for these pharmaceutical activities indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount of this reporting unit by approximately 15 million and 25 of the reporting unit’s carrying value excluding these pharmaceutical activities the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a rang e of approximately 950 million to 23 billion and 300  to 1560 of the reporting unit’s carrying value   

  

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 or 2013 

  

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate i ntangible assets impairments during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were not material 

  

 

sharebased compensation 

  

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

  

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during t he years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

  





  

changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors higher estimated volatility increases the fair value of a stock option while lower estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2015 was 120 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 04 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2015 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by 01 million 

  

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2015 would have increased or decreased by approximately 11 million and 12 million respectively and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2015 for options awarded during 2015 would have increased or decreased by 02 million and 03 million respectively 

  

sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was 199 million which is net of a reduction of 36 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

  

 

modifications of the terms of outstanding awards may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2015 2014 or 2013 

  

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued during t he years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 totaled 256 million 240 million and 222 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 201 5 was 37 8 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years   

  

income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

  

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2015 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 

  

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made     

  

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 0 1 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

  

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 4933 million at december 31 2015 of which approximately 3412 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2015 no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate   the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 

 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 74 million and 61 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 

  

results of operations and trends 

  

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

  

distributor purchasing and inventories  when selling our products through distributors changes in distributors’ inventory levels can impact our reported sales and these changes may be affected by many factors which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices which are the endusers therefore we believe it is important to track sales to end users in the relevant periods by our significant distributors in order to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on our reported revenue in those periods effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us however changes in prior year us distributors’ inventory levels can still impact 2015 reported growth results in certain countries internationally we continue to sell our products through third party distributors although we are unable to obtain data for sales to end users from certain less significant nonus third party distributors we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors’ inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates in the relevant periods following our transition to an all direct us distribution approach we anticipate that changes in distributor inventory levels will have an immaterial impact on our growth in future years 

  

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

  

effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services 

  

we incurred transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy in the us including approximately 5 million in incremental expense during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from the ramp up of sales and operating resources we also incurred 95 million in nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 associated with project management and other onetime costs required to implement this new strategy further we incurred onetime transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of 25 million and 21 million respectively in such period 

  

 

during the three months ended december 31 2014 we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and instrument consumables upon delivery to end users in the us instead of at distribution we also began to capture additional revenue that was previously earned by our distribution partners net of other changes related to this alldirect strategy such as free nextday shipping and a new returns policy for expired product we refer to this net additional revenue as distributor margin capture this net incremental revenue allowed us to expand our sales marketing and customer support resources which we expect will drive future revenue growth and to build out our distribution capability we expect investments in these areas will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates and provide accretive benefits to operating profit also as a result of the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us we incurred additional working capital demands including inventory costs previously borne by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a longer elapsed time to collect our receivables 

  

currency impact  for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see “part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates see “part i item 1a risk factors” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding tax impacts   

  

the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by   accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” otherwise referred to herein as a   nongaap financial measure as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we   believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’   ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods   

  

effective january 1 2014 we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange   rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the   comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period prior to january 1 2014   we calculated this impact by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year   period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period this   change in methodology which was implemented to achieve operational efficiencies has not had a material impact on organic   revenue growth see the subsection below titled “results of operations” for the definition of and other information regarding   organic revenue growth 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenues by approximately 897 million due primarily to the strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies in which we conduct business additionally our operating profit and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 were reduced by 212 million and 016 per share respectively which are net of offsetting gains of 209 million and 016 per share respectively from our foreign currency hedging activities   

  

at our current currency exchange rate assumptions we anticipate that the strengthening of the us dollar relative to major foreign currencies in which we transact will decrease total company revenue by approximately  40 million in the year ending december 31 2016 additionally these changes in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to reduce total company operating profit by 31 million and diluted earnings per share by 026 this unfavorable impact is net of offsetting foreign currency hedging gains which are expected to increase total company operating profit by 8 million and diluted earnings per share by 006 in the year ending december 31 2016 the above estimate assumes that the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will reflect the euro at 107 the 

 

british pound at 141 the canadian dollar at 068 the australian dollar at 068 and the japanese yen at ¥118 to the us dollar for the full year of 2016 

  

effects of economic conditions  demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments diagnostic imaging and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services in the us we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although this data is a limited sample and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather which may affect the number of patient visits in a given period we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services 

  

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction testing volumes may also be impacted by severe weather conditions such as drought in addition fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and livestock testing programs 

  

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

  

effects of patent expiration  although the company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2015 and are expected to expire during 2016 and 2017 the expiration of these patents or licenses  individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents and   our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings see item 1 “patents and licenses” for more information 

  

twelve months ended december 31 201 5 compared to twelv e months ended december 31 2014 

  

revenue 

  

the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends 

  

the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations – currency impact ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period 

 

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment   

  



  

we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced both reported cag and total company reported revenues by 25 million the impact of prior year changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported cag and total company growth by 3 and 2 respectively 

  

us and international revenue the following table provides further analysis of total company revenue by us markets and nonus or international markets 

  



  

the increase in both us and international organic revenues was driven by cag diagnostics recurring revenue the increase in organic international revenues was driven primarily by volume growth in europe asiapacific markets canada and to a lesser extent latin america us revenue benefitted from distributor margin capture relating to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy the impact of the prior year drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels increased reported us revenue growth by 3 c hanges in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported international revenue growth by less than 1  

  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag   

  



  

 

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our vetlab consumables and our reference laboratory diagnostic services resulting from both increased volumes as well as higher realized prices from distributor margin capture relating to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us the impact of the prior year drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels increased reported cag diagnostics recurring revenue growth by 3 

  

vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes resulting from growth in testing from existing customers and an expanded menu of available tests including our new t 4 test additionally we benefitted from higher average unit sales prices due primarily to distributor margin capture relating to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us the impact of the prior year drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels increased reported consumables revenue growth by 5   

  

vetlab   service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments vetlab service and accessories revenue also benefited from higher average unit sales prices resulting primarily from distributor margin capture relating to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us 

  

the increase in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to impacts related to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us including higher average unit sales prices resulting from distributor margin capture and the impact of the drawdown of inventory held by distributors during the fourth quarter of 2014 which increased 2015 reported revenue growth by 8 to a lesser extent we also benefitted from higher canine snap 4dx plus sales volumes these favorable factors were partly offset by the impact of competitive losses on certain earlier generation rapid assay products in the us in the first half of 2015 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher testing volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories most prominently in the us resulting from increased testing from existing customers and the net acquisition of new customers additionally the increase in revenue was the result of higher average unit sales prices due to price increases 

  

the increase in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was driven by sales of our catalyst one analyzer resulting primarily from instrument placements in europe and the asiapacific region and the recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with 2014 us preorders for our catalyst one analyzer additionally we benefitted from increased procyte dx instrument placements most notably in the us these favorable factors were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices realized on our instrument placements   

  

the increase in customer in formation management and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was due primarily to higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our active installed base of di agnostic   imaging and practice management systems and higher revenues from other customer information management services and an increasing pet health network pro subscriber base these favorable f actors were partly offset by fewer cornerstone placements and the unfavor able impact of increased diagnostic   imaging system placements under upfront customer loyalty programs for which the consideration and related revenue will be deferred and recognized over future periods  which resulted in an overall decrease in diagnostic imaging system sales 

  

during the third quarter of 2015 we launched idexx neo practice management software a saas practice management system in north america under this delivery model we provide hosted software in the cloud on a subscription basis during the next year w e anticipate that demand for neo our subscriptionbased saas practice management offering will moderate future revenue growth from new licensedbased cornerstone placements as we evolve to a subscriptionbased model for new customer acquisitions of idexx practice management systems  we believe that once established this subscriptionbased model will provide higher profitability as compared to the historical licensebased placements   

  

  water the increase in water revenue was distributed across all major regions and resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of our colilert and related accessories used in our coliform and e coli testing placements of our quantitray sealer plus instrument  which we launched in june 2015 and increased sales of our products designed to detect cryptosporidium 

  

 

livestock poultry and dairy the increase in lpd organic revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of certain bovine tests  poultry and swine tests  most prominently in the asi apacific region and europe and to a lesser degree in the us and latin america  these favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in livestock testing services in the asiapacific region 

  

other the decrease in other revenue was due primarily to lower sales volumes of our pharmaceutical product line lower sales volumes of our opti medical blood gas analyzers most prominently in the asia pacific region and lower average unit sales prices on related opti medical consumables 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  

gross profit increased due to higher sales  due in part to the prior year drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 56 from 55   the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from lower production costs that are not allocated to our segments  higher average cag unit sales prices primarily resulting from distributor margin capture net of related freight and distribution expenses relating to our transition within the us to an alldirect sales strategy for our rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables and the positive net effect of currency  lower production costs were due primarily to the recognition of previously capitalized favorable standard cost variances for our lpd vetlab consumables and rapid a ssay test kits inventories which are recorded within unallocated amounts the positive net effect of currency resulted from higher relative hedging gains during 2015 as compared to the prior year which more than offset the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  these overall favorable factors were partly offset by unfavorable product mix resulting primarily from higher relative instrument revenues which yield lower relative margins during 2015 as compared to 2014 

  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales  due in part to the prior year drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels  the gross profit percentage of 54 was unchanged from the prior year as the impact of unfavorable product mix resulting primarily from higher relative instrument revenues which yield lower relative margins  was entirely offset by the benefit of higher average unit sales prices primarily resulting from distributor margin capture net of related freight and distribution expenses relating to our transition within the us to an alldirect sales strategy for our rapid assay t est kits and vetlab consumables and the positive net effect of currency the positive net effect of currency resulted from higher relative hedging gains during 2015 as compared to the prior year which more than offset the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  

  

water gross profit for water increased due primarily to an increase in the gross profit percentage from 66 to 71 and higher sales the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from the expiration of certain royalties on december 31 2014 and the positive net effect of currency the positive net effect of currency resulted from higher relative hedging gains during 2015 as compared to the prior year which more than offset the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  these overall favorable factors were partly offset by a less favorable product mix due primarily to higher relative instrument and accessories sales which yield lower relative margins 

  

 

livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd decreased due to lower sales and a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 63 to 61 the decrease in the gross profit percentage reflects lower volume efficiencies resulting from a decrease in our asiapacific region livestoc k testing services revenue and current year unfavorability from the absence of the onetime decrease in royalty expense which occurred during the first quarter of 2014 resulting from a settlement with a licensor of certain patents 

  

other gross profit for other decreased due to lower sales and a decrease in the gross profit percentage from 53 to 49 the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to our opti medical business including lower average unit sales prices on consumables used by our blood gas analyzers and to a lesser extent higher overall manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates additionally the other gross profit percentage declined due to an unfavorable product mix resulting from lower relative sales of our pharmaceutical product line 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts increased due primarily to a decrease in certain manufacturing costs the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the net favorable impact to gross profit resulting from decreased manufacturing costs was due to the capitalization of favorable manufacturing variances primarily related to lpd vetlab consumables and our rapid assay test kit inventories during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 the majority   of these favorable variances were recognized within unallocated amounts during the year ended december 31 2015  

  

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

  



  

  



  

 

during the year ended december 31 2015 w e recorded an 82 million impairment charge related to internallydeveloped software not yet placed into service within unallocated amounts as a result of a strategic shift to refocus our development efforts within our i nformation management business   during the year ended december 31 2014 t he transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us within our cag segment reduced operating profit by 35 3 million  our alldirect transition impacts consisted of a onetime reduction in operating profit related to the drawdown of inventory held by our us distributors which reduced operating income by 208 million 50 million in incremental expenses related to the ramp up of sales and operating resources and approximately 95 million of nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

for the year ended december 31 2015 adjusted operating income which is total company operating income adjusted for the aforementioned software impairment charge was approximately 3081 million and 192 of revenue which represents an increase in adjusted operating income of 126 million and 43 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 which is adjusted for the aforementioned alldirect sales strategy transition impacts adjusted operating income is a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to operating income reported in accordance with us gaap management believes that reporting adjusted operating income provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our operating income performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

  

see the subsection above titled “effects of certain factors on results of operations – distributor purchasing and inventories” fo r details regarding transitional costs related to moving to an alldirect sales strategy for vetlab consumables and rapid assay products and services within our cag segment in the us 

  

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased personnelrelated costs resulting primarily from our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us as well as increases in global commercial resources and incremental information technology costs to support the alldirect sales strategy these unfavorable factors were partly offset by the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the absence of 95 million in nonrecurring transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and to a lesser extent   incremental credit card fees   associated with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us partly offset by the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by lower external development and materials costs 

  

water the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs and increased spending on promotional activities partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was generally consistent with the prior year as the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was almost entirely offset by increased personnelrelated costs research and development expense was also generally consistent with the prior year 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the decrease in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in general and administrative expense resulted from higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to lower personnelrelated costs and the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

other operating expenses for other which totaled 104 million for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased 13 million as compared to the prior year due primarily to a reduction in opti medical spending for external product development and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partly offset by higher personnelrelated costs 

  

unallocated amounts   operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased by 61 million to 69 million for the year ended december 31 2015 due primarily to a decrease in personnelrelated costs related to cost control initiatives and the absence of certain foreign currency losses on monetary assets partly offset by the impairment of internaluse software recorded during 2015 we estimate certain personnel related costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 25 million and 17 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher yields from our portfolio of marketable securities that we purchased during 2015 

  

interest expense was  292 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 154 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to approximately 450 million in senior notes that we issued and sold through private placements between july 2014 and june 2015 for which fixed interest rates range from 1785 to 376 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes in addition increased interest expense resulted from the impact of higher average borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our eff ective income tax rate was 297  for the year ended december 31 2015 and 262 for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 was related to lower relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a nonrecurring benefit recognized during period ended december 31 2014 related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error which is not material to prior interim or annual periods 

 

on december 18 2015 the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 was passed 2015 path act the 2015 path act provided a retroactive and permanent extension of the us research and development “rd” tax credit as a result we recorded the entire 2015 tax benefit during the three months ended december 31 2015 as the rd tax credit was available for both the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 it did not have a significant impact on changes in our fullyear effective tax rate 

  

twelve months ended december 31 2014 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2013 

  

revenue 

  

the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates acquisitions and divestitures organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends 

  

the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations – currency impact ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period 

  

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

  



  

we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced both reported cag and total company revenue growth by 2 

  

 

us and international revenue the following table provides further analysis of total company revenue by us markets and nonus or international markets 

  



  

the increase in both us and international revenues was primarily driven by cag diagnostics recurring revenue the increase in international revenues was driven by strong volume growth in europe and asiapacific markets we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced reported us revenue growth by 3 the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on reported international revenue growth 

  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

  



  

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagnostic services and our vetlab consumables the drawdown of inventory held by distributors as a result of our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced reported cag diagnostics recurring revenue by 3 

  

vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher unit volumes the increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base of catalyst and procyte dx   instruments as a result of new customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing from existing customers including those who upgraded to these instruments additionally vetlab consumables revenue benefited from higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our vettest chemistry instrument as customers continue to upgrade from our vettest instrument to our catalyst instruments the drawdown of inventory held by distributors resulting from our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced reported consumables revenue growth by 5 

  

vetlab   service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our installed base of instruments 

  

 

the decrease in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to the drawdown of inventory held by distributors as we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 which reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 7 this unfavorable factor was partly offset by higher sales of both our canine and feline testing products resulting from both an increase in us practicelevel sales volumes and higher average unit sales prices 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories resulting from increased testing from existing customers the acquisition of new customers and improved customer retention additionally the increase in revenue was favorably impacted by higher average unit sales prices due to price increases 

  

the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of deferred revenue associated with preorders for our catalyst one analyzer which we launched during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the impact of lower realized prices under our catalyst one introductory offer customers are provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument through the catalyst one delivery date as a result we do not recognize instrument revenue for preorders relating to the catalyst one introductory offer until the catalyst one is delivered these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher placements of our catalyst dx and procyte dx instruments primarily in europe and the asiapacific region and placements of our snap pro mobile device in north america for the year ended december 31 2014 the majority of snap pro mobile device placements were made under a reagent rental program for which instrument revenue will be recognized with the future sale of consumables 

  

the increase in customer information management and diagnostic imaging systems revenue was due primarily to a growing pet health network pro subscriber base higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base of diagnostic imaging and practice management systems and higher revenue from hardware upgrades as a result of microsoft ending support for windows xp  

  

water the increase in water revenue resulted from higher revenue from our colilert products and related accessories due primarily to increased sales volumes worldwide resulting from the acquisition of new customers 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the increase in lpd organic revenue was due primarily to higher sales of certain bovine test products and livestock testing services in the asiapacific region higher volumes in europe of our milkbased bovine pregnancy test and higher sales of poultry tests in europe and latin america  the acquisition of a brazilian distributor of our lpd products in the third quarter of 2013 added 4 to reported revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year 

  

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher milestone revenue from our pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements earned during the year ended december 31 2014 and higher sales volumes associated with our opti medical consumables and pharmaceutical product line these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower sales of our opti medical instruments in latin america 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  

 

gross profit increased due to higher sales the gross profit percentage was consistent with the prior year as the favorable impact s of higher average unit sales prices for our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio and for our lpd test products combined with lower overall vet lab product costs were offset by impacts related to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 including an unfavorable product mix resulting from the inventory drawdown of higher margin rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables from our us distributors and higher freight and distribution costs 

  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and a slight increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall vetlab product costs and price increases across our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio these favorable factors were partly offset by impacts related to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 including an unfavorable product mix resulting from the inventory drawdown of higher margin rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables from our us distributors and higher freight and distribution costs 

  

water gross profit for water increased due primarily to higher sales the slight increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to a more favorable product mix resulting from higher relative sales of our colilert products which yield higher margins lower overall manufacturing costs resulting from a decrease in materials costs and higher average unit sales prices due to price increases these favorable factors were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency due primarily to lower relative hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year 

  

livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd increased due to an improvement in t he gross profit percentage to 63 from 56  and higher sales the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from lower overall manufacturing costs driven by higher production volumes a decrease in royalty expense and higher average unit sales prices the decrease in royalty expense was due primarily to an agreement executed in the first quarter of 2014 with a licensor of patents related to the sale of certain swine tests   

  

other gross profit for other increased due to higher sales and an improvement in the gross profit percentage to 53 from 50 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs in our opti medical business resulting from a reduction in material costs and higher production volumes and an increase in milestone revenue related to our pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements for which there is no associated costs of revenue these favorable factors were partly offset by higher cost of service associated with opti medical instruments and a decrease in average unit sales prices on related consumables 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts decreased due primarily to an increase in certain manufacturing costs and changes in certain currency exchange rates 

  

the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the net unfavorable impact to gross profit as a result of increased manufacturing costs was due to the capitalization of favorable manufacturing variances primarily within our lpd business during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the us dollar strengthened significantly against the japanese yen during the year ended december 31 2013 the strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen during the year ended december 31 2014 was less significant as compared to the prior year resulting in a lower favorable variance within unallocated amounts relating to the cost of products sold in japanese yen

the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us within our cag segment reduced operating profit by 353 million during the year ended december 31 2014 these impacts consisted of a onetime reduction in operating profit related to the drawdown of inventory held by our us distributors which reduced operating income by 208 million 50 million in incremental expenses related to the ramp up of sales and operating resources and approximately 95 million of nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 for the year ended december 31 2014 adjusted operating income which is total company operating income adjusted for the aforementioned transition impacts was approximately 2956 million and 196 of revenue which represents an increase in adjusted operating income of 247 million and 91 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 which is adjusted for the 2013 bankruptcy of a thirdparty service provider of approximately 41 million adjusted operating income is a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to operating income reported in accordance with us gaap management believes that reporting adjusted operating income provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our operating income performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

  

see the subsection above titled “effects of certain factors on results of operations – distributor purchasing and inventories” for details regarding transitional costs related to moving to an alldirect sales strategy for vetlab consumables and rapid assay products and services within our cag segment in the us 

  

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from higher personnelrelated costs across all major regions including our north american sales force transformation started in the second half of 2013 and increased commissions resulting from improved sales performance and nonrecurring consulting costs related to the aforementioned implementation of an alldirect sales strategy in the us the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and to a lesser extent depreciation of internaluse software partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and increased materials costs partly offset by lower external consulting and development costs 

  

water the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs and incremental spending on promotional activities personnelrelated costs included commissions related to improved sales performance and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of our distributor in south africa in the fourth quarter of 2013 the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher materials costs 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from higher personnelrelated costs including incremental costs associated with the acquisition of a brazilian distributor in the third quarter of 2013 and commercial team investments worldwide most significantly in the asiapacific region the increase in general and administrative expense resulted from incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the brazilian distributor primarily personnelrelated costs and higher amortization of the acquired intangible assets the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs 

  

other operating expenses for other increased 15 million to 118 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs and an increase in external development and consulting costs in our opti medical line of business 

  

unallocated amounts   operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased by 09 million to 131 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year due primarily to certain foreign exchange losses and an increase in certain personnelrelated costs these unfavorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a 41 million loss incurred during the year ended december 31 2013 resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider 

  

over the second half of 2014 the us dollar experienced a continued and persistent strengthening relative to all major foreign currencies in which we transact resulting in realized and unrealized losses on monetary assets partly offset by gains on liabilities denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 

  

 

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate these budgeted expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 17 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 19 million for the prior year  the decrease in interest income resulted from our june 2014 disposition of a debt investment and repayment of the related notes receivable partly offset by increased interest income earned on higher a verage cash balances see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the disposition of this strategic investment 

    

interest expense was 154 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 54 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to senior notes that we issued and sold through three private placements between december 2013 and september 2014 in an aggregate principal amount of 350 million fixed interest rates on the senior notes range from 332 to 404 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 262 for the year ended december 31 2014 and 287 for the year ended december 31 2013 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 was related to higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates a nonrecurring benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error which is not material to current or prior interim or annual periods and the resolution of domestic and international tax audits which resulted in a net reduction in our provisio n for uncertain tax positions these favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in the benefit from the rd tax credit during the three months ended march 31 2013 legislation in the us retroactively allowed the rd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rd tax credit through the year ended december 31 2013 as a result in the year end ed december 31 2013 we recorded the benefit of two years of rd tax cre dit as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 in which we have recorded only the benefit related to that year’s activities 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available on our 850 million fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility under an amended and restated credit agreement that we executed in december 2015 the “credit facility” in addition we issued 150 million of senior notes in february 2015 and € 889 million approximately 100 million of eurodenominated senior notes in june 2015 during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we purchased marketable debt securities using a portion of our cash balances at de cember 31 2015 and 2014 we had 3426 million and 3225 million respectively of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital including our credit facility totaled negative 351 million and negative 615 million respectively at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 additionally at december 31 2015 we had remainin g borrowing availability of 276 0 million under our 850 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents our portfolio of shortduration marketable securities funds generated from operations and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will also be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our business as currently conducted 

  

 

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for several reasons including the complexity of laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate the varying tax treatment of potential repatriation scenarios and the timing of any future repatriation we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash and marketable securities are generall y available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

  

of our total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2015 approximately 3412 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects we held marketable securities with original maturities of two years or less that had an average a a credit rating as of december 31 2015 of the 213 6 million in marketable securities held as of december 31 2015 approximately 83  of the fair value of our marketable securities consisted of corporate bonds 6 consisted of agency bonds with the remainder consisting of us and canadian government bonds municipal bonds commercial paper and certificates of deposit of the 1290 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31 2015  85 was held as bank deposits 6 was invested in money market funds restricted to us government and agency securities 6 was invested in money market funds invested in highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities and the remainder consisted of commercial paper and agency bonds with original maturities of less than ninety days as of dec ember 31 2015 approximately 70  of the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in us dollars 

  

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 2164 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 compared to 2358 million for the same period of the prior year  the total of net income and net noncash charges excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements to a financing activity was 2975 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 compared to 2616 million for the same period in 2014 resulting in incremental operating cash flows of 359 million driven primarily by the impact of higher net income net of depreciation and amortization expense and an impairment of internallydeveloped software recorded during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 the total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements decreased cash by 811 million and 258 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively resulting in an incremental decrease in cash of 553 million 

  

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements 

  



  

the incremental cash used by accounts receivable during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 was due primarily to our transition to an alldirect strategy in the us including the establishment of accounts receivable directly with our us endusers that previously purchased from our us distribution partners which take a longer elapsed time to collect additionally accounts receivable was impacted by increased revenues during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 relative to the same period in the prior year including the margin capture associated with the aforementioned alldirect strategy in contrast we received the benefit of collecting the final accounts receivable from our us distribution partners during december 2014 the net incremental cash provided by other assets and accrued liabilities was due primarily to lower income taxes receivable resulting from 2014 tax payments in advance of the tax increase prevention act enactment and related benefits late in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the recognition of previously deferred catalyst instrument costs under the catalyst one introductory offer where we recognized the revenue and cost of catalyst instruments upon delivery of the catalyst one instruments or customer election to keep the catalyst dx instruments during 2015 these factors were partly offset by the incremental cash used for personnelrelated accruals including higher relative payments related to employee incentive programs and higher payments for other accruals due to increases in expenses during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period of the prior year the cash used by deferred revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to cash provided during the same period of the prior year was due primarily to the aforementioned catalyst one introductory offer cash used by inventories continued at a similar level to 2014 due to growth in volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher inventory levels to support new instrument and diagnostic test launches 

  

  we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

  

investing activities  cash used by investing activities was 3084 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015  as compared to 804 million for the same period of the prior year  the increase in cash used by investing activities was due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 to a lesser extent incremental capital investments in our reference laboratory equipment and facilities during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 also contributed to the increase in cash used by investing activities 

 

our total capital expenditure plan for 2016 is estimated to be approximately 90 million which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

  

financing activities cash used by financing activities was  956 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 compared to cash used of 1034 million for the same period in 2014 the decrease in cash used by financing activities was due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock the aggregate issuance of approximately 250 million of senior notes during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to 200 million of senior notes issued during the same period of th e prior year and lower relative net borrowings under the credit facility during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 as compared to the same period of the prior year 

  

in june 2015 we entered into an amended and restated multicurrency note purchase and private shelf agreement the “amended agreement” among the company prudential investment management inc “prudential” and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein which amends and restates the note purchase and private shelf agreement dated july 21 2014 pursuant to the amended agreement we issued and sold through a private placement a principal amount of €889 million approximately 100 million of 1785 series c senior notes due june 18 2025 the “2025 notes” we used the net proceeds from this issuance and sale of the 2025 notes for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under our credit facility 

  

in december 2014 we entered into a multicurrency note purchase and private shelf agreement the “metlife agreement” with accredited institutional purchasers named therein pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell 75 million of 325 series a senior notes having a sevenyear term the “2022 notes” and 75 million of 372 series b senior notes having a twelveyear term the “2027 notes” in february 2015 we issued and sold the 2022 notes and the 2027 notes pursuant to the metlife agreement we used the net proceeds from these issuance and sales for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under our credit facility 

  

cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by 2162 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period of the prior year from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2015 we have repurchased 582 million shares during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we purchased 57 million shares for an aggregate cost of 4064 million  as compared to purchases of 98 million shares for an aggregate cost of 6182 million during 2014 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

  

as noted above we refinanced our existing 700 million credit facility during december 2015 increasing the principal amount there under to 850 million the credit facility matures on december 4 2020 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until december 2020 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 1375 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate based on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0375 based on our leverage ratio 

  

 

net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in less cash provided of 2480 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period of the prior year at december 31 2015 we had 5730 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates  and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations  the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility   the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness crossacceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default 

  

since december 2013 we have issued and sold through private placements senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of approximately 600 million pursuant to certain note purchase agreements collectively the “senior note agreements” the senior note agreements contain affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of our subsidiaries priority indebtedness fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation as defined in the senior note agreements not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreements see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes 

  

should we elect to prepay the senior notes such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable makewhole amounts as defined within the applicable senior note agreements additionally in the event of a change in control of the company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the company the proceeds of which are not reinvested as defined in the senior note agreements we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes the obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable senior note agreement each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness and crossacceleration to specified indebtedness 

  

other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

  

under our workers ’ compensation insurance policies for us employees we have retained the first 300000 300000 and 250000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of 35 million  23 million and 20 million for the years ended december 31 2015 201 4 and 201 3  respectively   workers’ compensation expense recognized during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 and our respective liability for such claims as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was not material claims incurred during the years e nded december 31 2015 and 2014 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 201 5  therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respec tive claim years for the years ended on or pr ior to december 31 2013  based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized  is not material as of december 31 2015 as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 13 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies 

  

 

under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for us employees we retain claims liability risk up to 42 5000  375 000 and 325 000 per incident per year in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we recognized employee healthcare claim expense of 346 million 320 million and 29  2 million during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively which represents actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of december 31 2015 and 2014 was  4 8 million and 41 million respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manuf acturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended dece mber 31 2015 approximately 25 of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies as compared to 28 and 26 for the year s ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively   the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for three of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands  singapore and dubai  the functional currency is the us dollar   

  

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a hedging instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

  

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year    from time to time we may also enter into other foreign currency exchange contracts or foreigndenominated debt issuances to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific balance sheet exposures including net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding eurodenominated notes issued during 2015 that we designated as a hedge of our euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries 

  

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2015  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended decem ber 31 2015 2014 and 2013  our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

  

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with the exception of certain emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge our exposure we hedge approximately 85 of the estimated exposure from intercompany product purchases and sales denominated in the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen australian dollar and swiss franc we have additional unhedged foreign currency exposures related to foreign services and emerging markets where it is not practical to hedge the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase s and sales t otaled  1 761 million and 1 86  7   million at dec ember 31 2015 and december 31 2014  respectively  at december 31 2015 we had 25 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of related tax expense   

  

our foreign currency exchange impacts are comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and exp enses 2 the impact of hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is di fferent from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projecte d revenues and expenses for 2016  excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in 

 

currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce oper ating income by approximately 13 million this level is higher than in previous years due to the addition of estimated unhedged foreign currency exposures  including emerging market currencies that have higher relative revenue growth and volatility the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded a s they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

  

in december 201 5  we refinanced our existing  700 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of  850 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on december 4  20 20 the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit facility” and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date alt hough the credit facility does not mature until december   4  20 20  all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk through june 30 2016 borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2015 were 5730 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 19  based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2015 and assuming we do not enter into additional interest rate swap agreements following th eir expiration on june 30 2016  an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 53 million on an annualized basis 

  

the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges  at december 31 2015 we had 02 million in unrealized losses on interest rate swaps recorded in other comprehensive income net of related tax benefit see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015 we purchased marketable debt securities which are classified as availableforsale and carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report on form 10k the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to changes in market interest rates as of december 31 2015 we estimate that a 1 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately 08 million 

  

additionally our cash equivalents and marketable securities are subject to credit risk the fair value of our investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration financial results and other factors to minimize this risk we invest in high quality investments with original maturities of two years or less we perform periodic evaluations of the credit ratings related to cash equivalents and marketable securities

we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing customer service sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in all major regions including africa asia pacific canada europe and latin america 

  

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical s ervice requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors effective january 1 2015 we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the us prior to januar y 1 2015    w e   market ed our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary   distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by distributors outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide generally through our direct sales force we market our digital radiography products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada we market our software products primarily through our direct sales force in the u  s   canada europe and australia we market our water and lpd products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force we sell our opti electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti products primarily through distributors and other resellers 

  

historically our largest customers have been the us distributors of our products in the cag segment our two largest cag distributors were henry schein animal health supply llc “henry schei n” and mwi veterinary supply inc “mwi” henry schein accounted for 8 of our 2014 revenue and 9 of our 2013 and 2012 revenue and 2  and 7 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2014 and 2013  respectively  mwi accounted for 8 of our 2014 2013 and 2012 revenue and 8  and 11 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively effective january 1 2015 most us distributors are no longer our customers as a result of o ur transition to an alldirect sa les strategy in the us 

  

research and development 

  

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and external consulting and development costs  were 983 million 880 million and 820 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively or 66 64 and 63 of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively   

  

 

patents and licenses 

  

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the company based on a variety of factors including providing protection for the company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property affording protection from competitors in certain markets enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our product s and offerings strengthening the company’s reputation and standing among customers employees and key suppliers and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters imitators and other copiers of technologies 

  

important patents and licenses include 

















  

while we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to the company  a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position these factors include our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments although the company had and will have several patents expire during 2014 and 2015  the expiration of these patents individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations in addition  we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights  

  

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

production and supply 

  

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers 

  

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include vettest   analyzers and consumables catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine and t 4 slides lasercyte   and lasercyte dx consumables vetautoread vetlyte and procyte dx analyzers and consumables and components of our snap pro mobile device 

  

 

vettest and catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest   and catalyst chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to idexx 

  

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

  

certain components incorporated into our snap products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing 

  

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

backlog 

  

we do not generally maintain significant backlog orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

  

competition 

  

we compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures se veral of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

  



 







  

government regulation 

  

many of ou r products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

  

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution 

  

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “ fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 

  

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity marking for their products 

  

 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is regulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax xpress  enterolert and simplate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fdaapproved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

  

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

  

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food safety medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report 

  

our business lines are highly competitive and our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a material negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

  



  



  



  





  



  



  



  



  



  



  

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

  

 

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

  

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves including packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 

  

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx and catalyst one consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vetlyte e lectrolyte vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap   rapid assay kits and snap pro mobile device livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products catalyst one lasercyte   and lasercyte dx hematology analyzer s to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

  

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

  

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

our business sells many products through distributors w hich present risks that could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we sell many of our products outside of the us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the us our distributors often offer products from several different companies and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products we have limited ability if any to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting marketing selling and supporting our products we cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market sell and support our products effectively we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results in addition violations of anticorruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the us may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position which could have a negative effect on our operating results 

  

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering with our transition to an alldirect sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the us effective january 1 2015 we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products we historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former us distribution partners and two of our previously exclusive us distribution partners joined a third former us distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014 the promotion and sale of our competitors’ products by our former us distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies also have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

  

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business 

  

in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws these legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines penalties and sanctions suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture market or sell our products and damage to our reputation 

  

increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

  

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include banfield pet hospital national veterinary associates and vca antech inc a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

  

our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

  

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

  

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

  

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european union’s standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we our products or our services do not comply with regulations and policies regarding privacy and protection of user data 

  

we offer products and services that store and use practice and client information including practice management systems for veterinary practices eg cornerstone online client communication tools and services eg pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and reference laboratories in one place some of these products and services rely on thirdparty providers for cloud storage we also engage in ecommerce through various idexx websites and collect contact and other personal or identifying information from our customers and visitors to our websites 

  

federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of personal information including data that we receive from our employees customers and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data including as a result of a breach by or of a thirdparty provider or to comply with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

  

any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets approximately 28 o f our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars 

  

 

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they continue could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

  

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 approximat ely 43 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 42 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business we may not be able to successfully promote market sell or distribute our products and services outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices prohibited by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

  

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

 

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters system disruptions and security breaches 

  

the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

  

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen if we were to experience a system disruption attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

  

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 

  

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures increase in the number and type of competitors changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in our sales and distribution model changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

  

 

future operating results could be negatively affected by changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to local state regional and federal tax laws in the us and many other international jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation also we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations if we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms the result could negatively impact our future earnings additionally the european commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers while we believe that our rulings are different than those being discussed the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results 

  

our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination is made 

  

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligatio ns or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants  o ur failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

  

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

  

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

description of segments  prior to january 1 2013 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we continue to refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health which we referred to as livestock and poultry diagnostics we also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” financial information about our dairy and opti medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments 

  

in 2013 we combined the management of our livestock and poultry diagnostics and dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies we refer to this segment as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our opti medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the year ended december 31 2012 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

  

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses and variances from standard cost for products sold resulting from changes in certain currency exchange rates in our segment disclosure these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

  

companion animal group 

  

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management by d oing so  we are able to build a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

  

cag diagnostics we refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the idexx diagnostic advantage we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarian’s diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories v eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight 

  

the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution during 2013 we reorganized our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in north america transitioning our specialty sales force that represented either inclinic or outside reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent all cag diagnostic modalities in addition to this reorganization we increased the size of our sales force resulting in smaller geographically sized sales territories these changes allowed for more frequent customer contact by a consistent sales professional we have experienced accelerated revenue growth subsequently to implementing this change 

  

 

to further increase our customer reach effective january 1 2015 we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our current annual contracts with our us distribution partners under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 

  

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro mobile device are nonrecurring in nature while revenues from the associated propri etary vetlab consumables snap rapid a ssay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are recurring in nature instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than those provided by our recurring revenues especially in the case of vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits therefore the mix of nonrecurring and recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

  

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 

  

prior to the catalyst one instrument launch during november 2014 we presold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a catalyst one were initially provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument under this marketing program we deferred 7 million of instrument revenue in 2014 which will not be recognized until delivery of the catalyst one instrument occurs in 2015 

  

we place our catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2014 these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 38000 units approximately half of 2014 catalyst analyzer placements were to customers that are new to idexx including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream we have found that the consumables revenues increase by approximately 25 when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst analyzer due to the superior capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst which leads to additional testing by the customer 

  

as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

  

 

the procyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte dx   and lasercyte   analyzers and vetautoread an alyzers as of december 31 2014  these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 27000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer i n 2014  slightly less than half of procyte placements were made at competitive accounts we als o continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and recertified  as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new a nd competitive accounts in 2014  a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were recertified instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

  

we seek to enhance the attractiveness of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests properly times the run captures and saves images of the results and    in conjunction with ivls records invoice charges in the patient record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition snap pro mobile device results can be shared with pet owners on th e snap pro screen or  in conjunction with ivls via vetconnect plus we also sell the   snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and  in conjunction with ivls records those results in the electronic medical record we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

  

prior to 2014 the snapshot dx was our primary inclinic solution which screened for thyroid disease with the recent launch of the total thyroxine “t 4 ”   slide for use with the catalyst one analyzer  we anticipate a decline in placements of the snapshot dx although we will continue to service the existing install base 

  

our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

  

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus  client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

  

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are considered recurring in nature recurring diagnostic revenue accounts for approximately 71  of our consolidated revenue and is both highly durable and profitable 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions  our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

  

 

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument  our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes  as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians  additionally we have found that veterinarian adoption of vetconnect plus drives utilization by spurring testing across all idexx diagnostic modalities in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse superior performance sensitivity specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  

we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

  

profitability from our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements when possible we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other countries expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the increased number of customer visits resulting from our alldirect sales strategy in the us will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years re curring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs under these arrangeme nts we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future 

  

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market 

  

 

customer information management and digital imaging systems  our cornerstone practice management system provides a superior integrated information solution backed by exceptional customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced function ality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits 

  

our digital imaging systems offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 

  

water 

  

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly v alue strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 52 of total wat er product sales in 201 4  and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

  

livestock poultry and dairy 

  

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products as result the performance of this business can fluctuate 

  

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages   the snap platform as well as the manufacturing equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penet ration in dairy processor s   and develop product line enhancements and extensions  

  

we also distribute food safety products including randox food diagnostics a wide range of cost effective elisas  sensitive and reproducible diagnostic assays for the detection of multiple compounds in one test based on a multianalyte quantitative screening drug residue analyzer called t he evidence investigator our technology for food safety screening reduces the number of samples sent to confirmation laboratories lowering costs on expensive confirmation tests we believe distributing food safety products provides us opportunities at a later stage in the food value chain 

  

 

in 2014 approximatel y 90 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe and china  the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other 

  

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals w e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

  

our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst dx platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

  

in 2014 approximately 83 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably asia and europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates o n an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when four criteria are m et i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

  

 

multiple e lement a rrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers digital imaging systems or practice management software  combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 

  

we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element  

  

when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

  

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

  

customer p rograms  we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credit s or cash and are earned by end users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 

  

 

customer loyalty programs  our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized r evenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future 

  

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points among other things these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 201 4  201 3 and 201 2  impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 

  

idexx instrument   marketing programs  our instrument   marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument   marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 201 4  201 3 and 201 2 at december 31 2014  a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximat ely 04 million 

  

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement 

  

idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of idexx points by customers  on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for t he years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  

  

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice  differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

  

 

following is a summary of revenue reductions net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended december 31 201 4  201 3 and 201 2  in thousands  

  



  



  

accrued customer programs are included within accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities depending on the anticipated settlement date in the consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form 10k following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and the ending accrued customer programs balance for t he years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  in thousands  

  





  

inventory valuation 

  

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

  

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized we assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the 

 

business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period contingent consideration is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings 

  

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

  

in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

  

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2014  we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units 

  

as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of september 30 201 4  the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the company’s market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units b y a range of approximately 120 million to 21 billion and 125 to 1063  of the reporting unit’s carrying value 

  

 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during t he years ended december 31 2014 2013 or 2012  

  

a prolonged economic downturn in the us or internationally resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate no material impairments of intangible assets were identified during t he years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012  

  

sharebased compensation 

  

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

  

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during t he years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

  





  

 

changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2014 was 107 millio n if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2014 would have increased or decreased by approximately 03 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2014 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million 

  

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2014 would have increased or decreased by approximately 10 million and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2014 for options awarded during 2014 would have increased or decreased by 02 million 

  

sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2014 was 181 million which is net of a reduction of 32 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall em ployee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

  

modifications of the terms of outstanding award s may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2014 2013 or 2012 

  

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stoc k units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 totaled 240 million 222 million and 182 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstandin g at december 31 2014 was 359 million whic h will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years   

  

income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for i ncome taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

  

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2014 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 

  

 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made     

  

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates chan ge in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 02 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewis e a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

  

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries we re 4317 million at d ecember 31 201 4  of which approximately 3215 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2014 no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 

  

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if t he statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 61 million and 66 million as of december 31 201 4 and 201 3  respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 

  

results of operations and trends 

  

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

  

distributor purchasing and inventories  the instrument consumables and rapid assa y products in our cag segment wer e sold in the us and continue to be sold in certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue 

  

 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

  

effective january 1 2015 we fully transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key us distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014 under this approach we take orders ship product invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the us aligning with our direct model for instruments reference laboratory services and other cag products and services 

  

we incurred transition costs to implement this alldirect sales strategy in the us   including approximately 5 million in incremental expense during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from the ramp up of sales and operating resources we also incurred 95 million in nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 associated with project management and other onetime costs required to implement this new strategy further w e incurred onetime transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of 25 million and 21 million respectively 

  

during the three months ended december 31 2014 we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and instrument consumables upon delivery to end users in the us instead of at distribution we continue to expect to capture an additional 50 million to 55 million in annual revenue on these direct sales we estimate that annual operating profit associated with this incremental revenue stream will increase approximately 5 million to 8 million in 2015 and will continue to provide accretive benefits that will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates also as a result of the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us we anticipate increased working capital demands of approximately 15 million to 20 million inclu ding inventory costs previously held by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a potentially longer elapsed time to collect our receivables 

  

currency impact  approximately 28 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies   strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure additionally our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks” included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding currency impact 

  

the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by   accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” otherwise referred to herein as a   nongaap financial measure as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we   believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’   ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods   

  

 

effective january 1 2014 we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange   rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the   comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period prior to january 1 2014   we calculated this impact by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year   period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period this   change in methodology which was implemented to achieve operational efficiencies has not had a material impact on organic   revenue growth see the subsection below titled “results of operations” for the definition of and other information regarding   organic revenue growth 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 83 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen partly offset by a weakening of the us dollar against the british pound 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 95 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen and the australian dollar 

  

effects of economic conditions  demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment including slow economic growth high unemployment and credit availability negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments digital radiography and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians additionally economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers although limited and susceptible to shortterm impacts such as weather we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful longterm representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services we believe the overall trends in patient visits and capital investments since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008 have had a slightly negative impact on our cag segment revenue growth rates although the rate of growth has not been steady we have seen an improvement in growth of patient visits since the beginning of 2012   

  

economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers in the past   water testing volumes have been susceptible to declines in discretionary testing and in mandated testing as a result of   decreases in home and commercial construction fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and   livestock testing programs 

  

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially   mitigate the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates 

  

effects of patent expiration  although the company had and will have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expire during 2014 and 2015 the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents and   our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings 

  

 

twelve months ended december 31 2014 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2013 

  

revenue 

  

the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth is a nongaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period for the prior year net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends 

  

the percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are nongaap financial measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations – currency impact ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period 

  

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment   

  



  

w e transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourt h quarter of 2014 resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced both reported cag and total company revenue growth by 2   

  

us and international revenue the following table provides further analysis of total company revenue by us markets and nonus or international markets 

  



  

the increase in both us and international revenues was primarily driven by cag diagnostics recurring revenue the increase in international revenues was driven by stron g growth in europe and asiapacific markets most significantly from the united kingdom germany china australia and france w e transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourt h quarter of 2014 resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced reported us revenue growth by 3 the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on reported international revenue growth   

  

 

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag   

  



  

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagn ostic services and our vetlab consumables t he drawdown of inventory held by distributors  as a result of our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014  reduced reported cag diagnostics recurring revenue by 3 

  

vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher unit volumes the increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of ou r installed base of catalyst and procyte dx   instruments as a result of new customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing from existing customers including those who upgraded to these instruments a dditionally vetlab consumables revenue benefited from higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases  these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our vettest chemistry instrument as customers continue to upgrade from our vettest instrument to our catalyst instrument s the drawdown of inventory held by distributors  resulting from our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 reduced reported consumables revenue growth by 5 

  

vetlab   service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our installed base of instruments 

  

the decrease in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to the drawdown of inventory held by distributors as we transitioned to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 which reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 7 this unfavorable factor was partly offset by higher sales of both our canine and feline testing products resulting from both an increase in us practicelevel sales volumes and higher average unit sales prices 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories resulting from increased testing from existing customers the acquisition of new customers and improved customer retention additionally the increase in revenue was favorably impacted by higher average unit sales prices due to price increases 

  

 

the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of deferred revenue associated with preorders for our catalyst one analyzer which we launched du ring the fourth quarter of 2014 and the impact of lower realized prices u nder our catalyst one introductory offer customers are provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument through the catalyst one delivery date as a result we do not recognize instrument revenue for preorders relating to the catalyst one introductory offer until the catalyst one is delivered  these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher placements of our catalyst dx and procyte dx instruments primarily in europe and the asiapacific region and placements of our snap pro mobile device in north america  for the year ended december 31 2014 the majority of snap pro mobile device placements were made under a reagent rental program for which instrument revenue will be recognized with the future sale of consumables 

  

the increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue was due primarily to a growing pet health network pro subscriber base higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base of digital imaging and practi ce management systems and higher revenue from hardware upgrades as a result of microsoft ending support for windows xp  

  

water the increase in water revenue resulted from higher revenue from our colilert products and related acce ssories due primarily to increased sales volumes worldwide resulting from the acquisition of new customers 

  

live stock poultry and dairy   the increase in lpd organic revenue was due primarily to higher sales of certain bovine test products in the asiapacific region higher volumes in europe of our milkbased bovine pregnancy test and higher sales of poultry tests in europe and latin america lower european bovine volumes are expected to reduce revenue by less than 5 million for t he year ending december 31 2015  the acquisition of a brazilian distributor of our lpd products in the third quarter of 2013 added 4 to reported revenue growth for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year 

  

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher milestone revenue from our pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements earned during the year ended december 31 201 4 and higher sales volumes associated with our opti medical consumables and pharmaceutical product line these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower sales of our opti medical instrument s in latin america 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  



  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and a slight increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall vetlab product costs and price increases across our cag diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio these favorable factors were partly offset by impacts related to our transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us during the fourth quarter of 2014 including an unfavorable product mix resulting from the inventory drawdown of high er margin rapid assay test kits and vetlab consumables from our us distributors and higher freight and distribution costs 

  

 

water gross profit for water increased due primarily to higher sales the slight increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to a more favorable product mix resulting from higher relative sales of our colilert products which yield higher m argins lower overall manufacturing costs resulting from a decrease in materials costs and higher average unit sales prices due to price increases  these favorable factors were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency due primarily to lower relative hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year 

  

livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd increased due to an improvement in the gross profit percentage to 62 from 55 and higher sales the increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from lower overall manufacturing costs  driven by higher production volumes  a decrease in royalty expense and higher average unit sales prices  the decrease in r oyalty expense was due primarily to an agreement executed in the first quarter of 2014 with a licensor of patents related to the sale of certain swine tests 

  

other gross profit for ot her increased due to higher sales and an improvement in the gross profit percentage to 53 from 50 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs in our opti medical business  resulting from a reduction in material costs and higher production volumes  and an increase in milestone revenue related to our pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements for wh ich there is no associated costs of revenue these favorable factors were partly offset by higher cost of service associated with opti medical instruments and a decrease in average unit sales prices on related consumables 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts decreased due primarily to an increase in certain manufacturing costs and changes in certain currency exchange rates 

  

the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the net unfavorable impact to gross profit as a result of increased manufacturing costs was due to the capitalization of favorable manufacturing variances primarily within our lpd business during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the us dollar strengthened significantly against the japanese yen during the year ended december 31 201 3 the strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen during the year ended december 31 2014 was less significant as compared to the prior year resulting in a lower favorable variance within unallocated amounts relating to the cost of products sold in japanese yen 

  

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

  



  

  

  

  

 

 



  

the transition to an alldirect sales strategy in the us within our cag segment reduced operating profit by 353 million during the year ended december 31 2014 these impacts consisted of a onetime reduction in operating profit related to the drawdown of inventory held by our us distributors which reduced operating income by 208 million 50 million in incremental expenses related to the ramp up of sales and operating resources and approximately 95 million of nonrecurring expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 for the year e nded december 31 2014 adjusted operating income which is   t otal company operating income adjusted for the aforementioned transit ion impacts was approximately 2956 million and 196  of revenue which represents an increase in adjust ed operating income of 247 million and 91  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 which is adjusted for the 2013 bankruptcy of a thirdparty service pro vider of approximately 41 million adjusted operating income is a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to operating income reported in accordance with us gaap management believes that reporting adjusted operating income provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our operating income performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers 

  

see the subsection above titled “effects of certain factors on results of operations – distributor purchasing and inventories” for details regarding anticipated transitional costs related to moving to an alldirect sales strategy for vetlab consumables and rapid assay products and services within our cag segment in the us 

  

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from higher personnelrelated costs across all major regions including our north american sales force transformation started in the second half of 2013 and increased commissions resulting from improved sales performance and nonrecurring consulting costs related to the aforementioned implementation of an alldirect sales strategy in the u s the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and to a lesser extent depreciation of internaluse software partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher person nelrelated costs and increased materials costs partly offset by lower external consulting and development costs   

  

 

water the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs and incremental spending on promotional activities personnelrelated costs included commissions related to improved sales performance and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of our distributor in south africa in the fourth qu arter of 2013 the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs th e increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher materials costs 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from higher personnelrelated costs including incremental costs associated with the acquisition of a brazilian distributor in the third quarter of 2013 and com mercial team investments worldwide most significantly in the asiapacific region the increase in general and administrative expense resulted from incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the brazilian distributor prima rily personnelrelated costs and higher amortization of the acquired intangible assets the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs 

  

other operating expenses for other increased 15 million to 118 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the pri or year due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs and an increase in external development and consulting costs in our opti medical line of business 

  

unallocated amounts   operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased by 09 million to 131 millio n for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year due primarily to cer tain foreign exchange losses and an increase in certain personnelrelated costs  these unfavorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a 41 million loss incurred during the year ended december 31 2013 resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider 

  

over the second half of 2014 the us dollar experienced a continued and persistent strengthening relative to all major foreign currencies in which we transact  resulting in realized and unrealized losses on monetary assets partly offset by gains on liabilities denominated in a currency other than the us dollar   

  

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

 

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 17 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 19 million for the prior year  the decrease in interest income resulted from our june 2014 disposition of a debt investment and repayment of the related notes receivable partly offset by increased interest income earned on higher average cash balances see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the disposition of this strategic investment 

    

interest expense was 154 million for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 54 million for the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to senior notes that we issued and sold through three private placements between december 2013 and september 2014 in an aggregate principal amount of 350 million fixed interest rates on the senior notes range from 332 to 404 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our senior notes 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 262 for the year ended december 31 2014 and 287 for the year ended december 31 2013 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 was related to higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates a nonrecurring benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error which is not material to current or prior interim or annual periods and the resolution of domestic and international tax audits which resulted in a net reduction in our provision for uncertain tax positions these favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in the benefit from the us research and development “rd” tax credit during the three months ended march 31 2013 legislation in the us retroactively allowed the rd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rd tax credit through the year ending december 31 2013 as a result in the year ending december 31 2013 we recorded the benefit of two years of rd tax credit as compared to the year ending december 31 2014 in which we have recorded only the benefit related to that year’s activities 

  

in 2015 it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to 04 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2014 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various tax jurisdictions

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

  



  

us and international revenue the following table provides further analysis of total company revenue by us markets and nonus or international markets 

  



  

the increase in both us and international revenues was primarily driven by cag diagnostics recurring revenue the increase in international revenues was driven by strong growth in europe and asiapacific markets most significantly within the nordic countries as a result of our move to a direct sales model in this region during the first quarter of 2013 germany and china the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced us  revenue growth by approximately 1 and did not have a significant impact on reported international revenue growth   

  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

  



  

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue is due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagnostic services and our vetlab consumables 

  

 

vetlab consumables revenue growth was due to higher unit volumes and higher realized prices the increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base for our catalyst dx and procyte dx   instruments as a result of customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing from existing customers who upgraded to these instruments partially offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest chemistry instrument higher realized prices were the result of changes in certain distributor arrangements and list price increases the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported consumables revenue growth by approximately 1 

  

vetlab   service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

  

the increase in rapid assay product revenue was due primarily to both higher unit volumes and higher realized prices resulting from price increases and a change in a distributor arrangement higher sales volumes were driven by an increase in us canine practicelevel sales volumes and increased volumes of our canine pancreatitis products the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on revenue growth 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted from the impact of both increased testing volumes and price increases higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers increased testing volumes from existing customers and improved customer retention 

  

the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the impact of customer programs the impact from customer programs includes a reagent rental program that we launched in north america during the fourth quarter of 2012 under the reagent rental program vetlab instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the minimum purchase agreement instead of at the time we place the instrument 

  

the increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from higher support revenue due to an increase in our active installed base and revenue from pet health network pro which launched commercially in the first quarter of 2013 these favorable factors were partly offset by a decrease in digital radiography system placements 

  

water the increase in water revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of our colilert products and related accessories in europe and north america driven by new account acquisitions and higher average unit sales prices 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the decrease in lpd revenue resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of bse tests resulting from changes in european testing requirements and a reduction in sales volumes of our dairy snap tests used for the detection of the contaminant aflatoxin m1 and antibiotic residues in milk in early 2012 dairy snap sales volumes were favorably impacted by testing as a result of an aflatoxin m1 outbreak in china testing volumes in china subsided over the remainder of 2012 these unfavorable factors were partly offset by higher sales of certain bovine tests resulting from increased testing levels from government programs and higher sales volumes of certain poultry and swine tests 

  

other other revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as lower sales volumes associated with our pharmaceutical product line were almost entirely offset by higher sales volumes of consumables and accessories used with our opti medical instruments 

  

 

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 54 from 52 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services vetlab consumables and to a lesser extent rapid assay products and volumerelated efficiencies realized throughout our reference laboratory operations 

  

water gross profit for water increased due primarily to higher sales the gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as the unfavorable impact of currency was mostly offset by higher average unit sales prices the unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year 

  

livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 55 from 59 partly offset by higher sales the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of currency higher manufacturing costs were due primarily to an increase in materials costs and lower production volumes in certain product lines the unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year 

  

other gross profit for other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50 from 42 due primarily to lower overall opti medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials costs and higher relative sales of consumables used with our opti medical instruments and milestone and royalty revenue earned from our remaining pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements both of which yield higher relative margins 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts increased due primarily to changes in certain currency exchange rates and a decrease in certain manufacturing costs partly offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs 

  

in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” for the year ended december 31 2013 these variances were due primarily to the cost of products sold in japanese yen 

  

the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable capitalized variances 

  

 

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” the increase in personnelrelated costs for unallocated amounts is due primarily to higher selfinsured healthcare costs during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year 

  

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

  



  



  

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased personnelrelated costs from investment in our commercial organizations in all major regions including the completion of our north american sales force expansion and associated marketing and consulting costs related to this transformation the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnelrelated costs and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and an increase in consulting and external development costs 

  

water the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

 

the increase in sales and marketing and general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs research and development expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs  including costs associated with the acquisition of a brazilian distributor and increased spending on promotional activities in the asia  pacific region the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the brazilian distributor a portion of which will not recur partly offset by lower personnelrelated costs and a decrease in intangible asset amortization research and development expense during the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year 

  

other operating expenses for other increased 25 million to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2013 due primarily to a 35 million milestone payment earned during the year ended december 31 2012 related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line partly offset by lower personnelrelated costs in our opti medical line of business the pharmaceutical milestone payment was not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business rather it was reflected as a reduction to general and administrative expenses as earned   

  

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 49 million to 121 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider “freight service company” partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as a result of the resolution of the ftc investigation in february 2013 and proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider in march 2013 the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by us to the freight service company were not subsequently remitted to our freight carriers due to an employee fraud and a breakdown in internal controls both at the freight service company concluding in significant losses and the resulting bankruptcy in response we recorded a 39 million loss related to these unremitted amounts in general and administrative expense during the year ended december 31 2013 we continue to monitor the freight service company’s bankruptcy proceeding but we cannot be certain of any recovery at this time 

  

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 19 million for both the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

  

interest expense was 54 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 38 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes that we issued and sold through a private placement in an aggregate amount of 150 million in december 2013 the senior notes consist of 75 million of 394 series a senior notes due december 11 2023 and 75 million of 404 series b senior notes due december 11 2025 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our senior notes 

  

 

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 287 for the year ended december 31 2013 and 316 for the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 was due primarily to the research and development “rd” tax credit for the year ended december 31 2012 the us legislation authorizing the rd tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period on january 2 2013 us federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an rd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rd tax credit through the year ending december 31 2013 because the related legislation was enacted in 2013 the full benefit of the rd tax credit related to the prior year’s activities was recognized in 2013 in addition higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility which we refinanced in june 2014 by entering into an amended and restated fiveyear unsecu red revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 700 million the amended and restated credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit facility” in addition we issued 150 million 125 million 75 million and 150 million of our senior notes in december 2013 july 2014 september 2014 and february 2015 respectively at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 we had 3225 million and 2791 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents and negative working capi tal of 615 million and working capital of 1744 million respectively additionally at december 31 201 4  we had remaining borrowing availabilit y of 150 million under our 700 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at similar rates to our existing borrowings to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations a nd committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purc hase requirements and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months we believe that t hese resources  coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our business as currently conducted 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund o rdinary business operations outside the us of our total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014 approximately 3215 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects  as of december 31 2014 64  of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was invested in money market funds restricted to us government and agency securities and 36  was held as bank deposits as of december 31 2014 approximately 66 of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in us dollars 

  

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 

  

 

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital 

  

  



  

1 days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter the result of which is then multiplied by 9125 days 

2 inventory turns represent inventoryrelated cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarterend divided by the inventory balance at the end of the quarter 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

the following table presents cash provided used 

  



  

operating activities cash provided b y operating activities was 2358 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2460 million for the same period in 201 3  the total of net income and net noncash charges excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements to a financ ing activity was 2616 million for the year ended dece mber 31 2014 compared to 2632 mil lion for the same period in 2013  resulting in a reduction in operating cash flows of 16 million driven primarily by the de crease in net income partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization the total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arra ngements decreased cash by 258 million during the year ended december 31 201 4  compared to a decrease of 172 million for the year ended december 31 201 3  resulting in an incr emental increase in cash of 86 million 

  

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements 

  



  

 

the incremental cash used by inventory during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year was due primarily to support higher expected demand for our cag diagnostic instruments as well as higher inventory levels for our kits and consumables to support our alldirect strategy in the us the increase in cash used by other assets during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year was due primarily to higher income taxes receivable resulting from the tax increase prevention act that was enacted late in the year and the deferred cost of catalyst instrument placements under our catalyst one introductory offer launched in the first quarter of 2014 the tax increase prevention act retroactively extended the rd tax credit and bonus depreciation and reduced our income taxes due related to the year ended december 31 20 14 the increase in cash provided by accrued liabilities during the year ended december 31 2014 was greater than the prior year due primarily to the timing of income tax payments higher accruals related to employee incenti ve programs co ntingent consideration related to business combinations and accrued interest related to higher borrowings under our senior notes at december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year end the decrease in cash used by accounts receivable during the year ended december 31 2014 resulted pri marily from the impact of lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 related to our alldirect strategy in the us  t he in crease in cash provided by accounts payable during the year ended december 31  2014 as compared to the prior year was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments the incremental cash provided by deferred re venue for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year was due primarily to sales under our catalyst one introductory offer  

  

  we historicall y have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first   quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period   driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which   the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant   increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

  

investing activities cash used by investing activities was 804 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 861 million for the same period in 2013 the decrease in cash used by investing activities during the year ended december 31 2014 was due primar ily to reduced capital expenditures resulting from the completion of our headquarters facility expansion in august 2013 partly offset by incremental cash used to acquire businesses during the year ended december 31 2014 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our business acquisitions 

  

our total capital expenditure plan for 2015 is e stimated to be approximately 85 million which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment investments in internal use software and inform ation technology infrastructure and the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

  

financing activities cash used by financing activities was 1034 million fo r the year ended december 31 2014 compared to cash used of 1025 mil lion for the same period in 2013 the increase in cash used to repurchase common stock was offset by higher relative net borrowings under the credit facility and a 50 million increase in the issuance of longterm debt during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the prior year 

  

 

cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock increased by 2504 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2014  we have repurchased 539 millio n shares during the year ended december 31 2014 we purchased 49 million shares for an aggregate cost of 6182 million compared to purchases of 40 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3678 million during 2013 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

  

as noted above in june 2014 we refinanced our existing 450 million credit facility and increased the principal amount thereunder to 700 million the credit facility matures on june 18 2019 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date although the credit facility does not mature until june 18 2019 all individual borrowings under the terms of the credit facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days at the end of each term the obligation is either repaid or rolled over into a new borrowing the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to provide prompt written notice to the syndicate of such an event based on the stated term and the existence of the subjective material adverse event clause this credit facility is reflected in the current liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheets applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 1375 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate based on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0375 based on our leverage ratio 

  

net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in incremental cash provided of 207 0 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year at december 31 2014  we had 549 0 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and sharebased compensation not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility   the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of the affirmative negative and financial covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness crossacceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manuf acturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program d escribed below approximately 28  of our consolidat ed rev enue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies   the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for two of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands and singapore  the functional currency is the us dollar   

  

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

  

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant trans actions as of december 31 2014 and 2013  we were not hedging any specific significant transactions 

  

 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2014  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended decem ber 31 2014 2013 and 2012  our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

  

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase s and sales t otaled 1867 million and 1683 million at dec ember 31 2014 and december 31 2013  respectively  at december 31 2014 we had 81 million of net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax expense 

  

our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is di fferent from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projecte d revenues and expenses for 2015  excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce oper ating income by approximately 9 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded a s they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

  

in june 2014 we refinanced our existing 4500 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 700 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on june 18 2019 we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of the credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” increases borrowings under the credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 1375 percentage points “credit spread” above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2014 were 549 million at a weighteda verage effective interest rate of 15 based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at december 31 2014 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 47 million on an annualized basis

 item 1 business 

  

we are a delaware corporation incorporated in 1983 we develop manufacture and distribute products and provide services primarily for the companion animal veterinary  livestock and poultry water testing and dairy markets we also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market our primary products and services are 

  

















  

 

description of business by segment 

  

prior to january 1 2013 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we continue to refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health which we referred to as livestock and poultry diagnostics we also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” financial information about our dairy and opti medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments 

  

in 2013 we combined the management of our livestock and poultry diagnostics and dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies we refer to this segment as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our opti medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments see note 1 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas  

  

the performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally for the year ended december 31 2013 sales of products and services to customers outside the us accounted for approximately 42 of our overall revenue these foreign sales accounted for approximately 35 51 and 88 of revenue in our cag water and lpd segments respectively see “part 1 item 1a risk factors” 

  

companion animal group 

  

cag provides diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions that enhance the health and wellbeing of pets to veterinarians the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services comprise a unique competitive advantage that we refer to as the idexx diagnostic advantage providing veterinarians with the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care the idexx diagnostic advantage improves staff efficiencies and also enables the veterinarian to communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner which ultimately leads to growing practice revenues 

  

cag diagnostics 

  

we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services which are integrated within our information management technologies to provide a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner 

  

integrated diagnostic information management 

  

vetconnect plus is a cloudbased technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ data from idexx’s diagnostic modalities these integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patientspecific testing results allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend patient  specific diagnostic results enabling greater medical insight in addition vetconnect plus provides instant mobile or browserbased access to results which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians in this way vetconnect plus can aid veterinarian s and practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient’s care which can support greater compliance with medical recommendations or preventive care protocols 

  

 

inclinic diagnostic solutions 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of both our idexx vetlab suite of inclinic chemistry and hematology analyzers and associated proprietary consumable products that provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results and a broad range of singleuse handheld idexx snap   rapid assay test kits that provide quick accurate and convenient pointofcare diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions 

  

the idexx vetlab suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products all of which are described below additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

  

blood and urine chemistry  we sell three chemistry analyzers the catalyst dx   chemistry analyzer the upcoming catalyst one chemistry analyzer and the vettest chemistry analyzer that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions these three instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” based on ortho’s dry slide technology in addition the catalyst dx and the catalyst one analyzer s also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by opti medical systems inc “opti medical systems” one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and other slides also manufactured by idexx blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin calcium creatinine blood urea nitrogen and total protein tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels all three analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the early detection of renal disease 

  

the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers provide significantly improved throughput ease of use and test menu relative to the vettest analyzer our original chemistry analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes phenobarbital and fructosamine key easeofuse features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system these analyzers also enable automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the catalyst dx and catalyst one run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum and urine in addition the catalyst dx and catalyst one analyzers run a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood allowing veterinarians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently  we began shipping a fructosamine test compatible for the catalyst dx and upcoming catalyst one analyzers during the fourth quarter of 2013 fructosamine levels are used to manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus helping to assess insulin treatments and adjust insulin dosages we expect to introduce a total thyroxine “t 4 ”   slide for use with the catalyst one analyzer upon its launch date and for use with the catalyst dx early in 2015 t 4 testing is essential to assessing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets 

  

the upcoming catalyst one analyzer is engineered to deliver the same laboratoryquality results and realtime work flow as the catalyst dx analyzer offering an attractive inhouse chemistry option when a single sample drawer is sufficient for a clinic’s workflow requirements in addition the catalyst one analyzer will be the industry’s first to combine chemistry electrolytes and t 4 in a single sample run placements of the catalyst one analyzer are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014 

  

we also sell two other chemistry analyzers the vetlyte electrolyte analyzer and the vetstat electrolyte and blood gas analyzer the vetstat analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that are manufactured by opti medical systems 

  

sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and recurring revenues generated from our installed base of idexx vetlab equipment 

  

 

hematology  we sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also called a complete blood count these analyzers include the procyte dx   hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry optical fluorescence and laminarflow impedance in its analysis the original lasercyte hematology analyzer and next generation lasercyte dx hematology analyzer launched in 2013 which both use laserflow cytometry technology in their analysis and the idexx vetautoread hematology analyzer our original hematology analyzer in addition the procyte dx   hematology analyzer the lasercyte dx hematology analyzer and the lasercyte hematology analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids we also sell the coag dx analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders 

  

the procyte dx   analyzer is our premier hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 the procyte dx analyzer provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the lasercyte lasercyte dx and vetautoread hematology analyzers the procyte dx analyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells for a more complete picture of a patient’s health the procyte dx is validated for ten companion animal species canine feline equine bovine ferret rabbit gerbil pig guinea pig and mini pig with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species in 2012 we began to place procyte dx   analyzers containing a more advanced and researchfocused user interface with customers in the bioresearch market in 2013 we launched the lasercyte dx hematology analyzer which combines the advanced capabilities of the original lasercyte hematology analyzer with several features of our procyte dx analyzer   

  

immunoassay testing instruments  with multiplepatient testing functionality the snapshot dx analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total t 4  cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function respectively the snapshot dx analyzer also reads interprets and records the results of many idexx rapid assay snap tests including our canine snap   4dx plus test   feline snap fivfelv combo test canine snap   cpl test feline snap   fpl test snap feline triple test and canine snap   heartworm rt test 

  

we are taking preorders for our upcoming snap pro mobile device that automatically activates a snap test properly times the run and captures an image of the result this device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results on the snap pro mobile screen or via vetconnect plus in addition the snap pro mobile device improves staff efficiency and ensures that all snap test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing we anticipate the snap pro mobile device will begin shipping at the end of the first quarter of 2014 

  

urinalysis  the idexx vetlab ua analyzer provides rapid semiquantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use 

  

idexx vetlab station  the idexx vetlab station “ivls” connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the idexx vetlab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability ivls securely connects to the internet and in this way enables idexx to perform through smartservice solutions remote instrument service and firmware updates to ivls and certain connected instruments ivls also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to vetconnect plus we sell ivls as an integral component of the catalyst dx lasercyte dx and procyte dx   analyzers and also as a standalone hardware platform the ivls includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers ivls also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the idexx vetlab suite stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap test results and sends and receives information from practice management systems including the idexx cornerstone system as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems 

  

 

the snap rapid assays are singleuse handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation although many kits may also be read and recorded automatically by the snapshot dx analyzer or activated and captured automatically by the snap pro mobile device as discussed above the principal snap rapid assay tests are as follows

patents and licenses 

  

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the company based on a variety of factors including providing protection for the company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property affording protection from competitors in certain markets enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings strengthening the company’s reputation and standing among customers employees and key suppliers and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters imitators and other copiers of technologies 

  

important patents and licenses include 

















  

while we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to the company  a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position these factors include our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth  quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are co mpatible with our instruments although the company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expected to expire during 2014 and 2015 the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations in addition  we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights  

  

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

 

production and supply 

  

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers 

  

instruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include vettest   analyzers and consumables catalyst dx consumables other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine and t 4 slides lasercyte   and lasercyte dx consumables and vetautoread vetlyte and procyte dx analyzers and consumables 

  

vettest and catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest   and catalyst chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to idexx 

  

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our snap rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

  

certain components incorporated into our snap products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing 

  

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

backlog 

  

we do not generally maintain significant backlog orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

  

competition 

  

we compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies   to small businesses focused on animal health  our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers  our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  

 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

  









  

government regulation 

  

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

  

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products  we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import product s manufactured in montpellier france   to the u  s  for distribution 

  

 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “ fda ” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated  mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 

  

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to ob tain european conformity marking for their products 

  

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is re gulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax   xpress  enterolert   and simplate for heterotrop h ic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs  w ater testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs in the us are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices  however   b efore products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fda  approved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam antibiotic residue test product ha s been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

  

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application opti medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

  

in addition to the foregoing our business is generally subject to various us and foreign regulatory authorities including the us federal trade commission the “ftc” and other anticompetition authorities and any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food safety medical device waterquality and other regulations of the fda the epa the usda the ftc and other federal agencies as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report 

  

our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy including 

  



  



  



  





  



  



  



  



 

  



  



  

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

  

our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results 

  

we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide components in our products manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves includ ing packagedelivery services because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives actions taken by them could have a negative effect on our results of operations the risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with thirdparty suppliers on reasonable terms inconsistent or inadequate quality control relocation of supplier facilities supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with their contractual obligations problems with suppliers could negatively impact our ability to supply the market substantially decrease sales lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers 

  

in addition we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include the majority of our catalyst dx consumables procyte dx hematology idexx vetautoread hematology vetlyte e lectrolyte vettest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap   rapid assay devices livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and lasercyte   and lasercyte dx hematology analyzer s to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations   

  

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

  

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products samples and the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

changes to our relationships with distributors and distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in t he us through distributors as a result we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creat ing a demand for our products our agreements with us distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ p roducts over our own products further distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the en duser demand for our products because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor changes to our relationship with a distributor such as a distributor becoming nonexclusive or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

  

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies further consolidation within distribution channels could increase our reliance on a limited number of distributors 

  

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

  

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

  

in the us the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda or the epa our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the manufacture and sale of our opti line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws for example on february 11 2013 the ftc granted final approval of the agreement containing consent order to cease and desist previously reached with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation into whether idexx had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act pursuant to this agreement we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products and as a result we entered into a modified agreement with mwi under which it is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to our business practices or the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products or impact our ability to market or distribute our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations   

  

increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

  

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include banfield pet hospital national veterinary associates and vca antech inc each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in other countries such as in the uk and nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets furthermore an increasing percentage of individuallyowned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

  

our success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights we also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of thirdparty technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license thirdparty patents and technologies on reasonable terms our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

  

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

  

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be prohibited from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

  

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

  

the market for our companion animal livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence for example the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the european union including the european union’s standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreement to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our operations and reputation may be impaired if we do not comply with regulations and policies regarding privacy and protection of user data 

  

we offer online client communication tools and services to veterinary practices through pet health network pro and cloudbased technology through vetconnect plus that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from idexx inclinic analyzers our rapid assays and refere nce laboratories in one place we also engage in ecommerce through the idexxcom website and various international idexx websites federal state and international laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of data that we receive from customers visitors to the websites of our customers and others in addition we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacyrelated laws government regulations or directives or industry selfregulatory principles could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise which could have an adverse effect on our business 

  

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

  

any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and expo rted to international markets approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars 

  

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems these conditions if they 

 

continue could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

  

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 42 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 41 and 43 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors in addition foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions and any repatriation of such funds to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period 

  

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of thirdparty reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

  

our operati ons are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters  system disruptions and security breaches 

  

the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

  

 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock poultry and dairy testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario wetherby uk and tokyo japan interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions although we employ system backup measures our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities further our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches including computer viruses any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publ icly disclosed lost or stolen if we were to experience a system disruption  attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business furthermore any access to public disclosure of or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings which could damage our reputation cause a loss of confidence in our products and services and adversely affect our business 

  

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

  

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 

  

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures customer marketing and incentive programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

  

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

  

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings 

  

 

restrictions in our debt agreements or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligatio ns or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants  o ur failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms in addition adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 

  

our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior t o their stated maturity dates should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

  

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

description of segments  prior to january 1 2013 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we continue to refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health which we referred to as livestock and poultry diagnostics we also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” financial information about our dairy and opti medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments 

  

in 2013 we combined the management of our livestock and poultry diagnostics and dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies we refer to this segment as livestock poultry and dairy “lpd” our opti medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments the segment income loss from operations discussed within this report for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including our product and service categories and our geographic areas 

  

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses and variances from standard cost for products sold resulting from changes in certain currency exchange rates in our segment disclosure these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

  

companion animal group 

  

our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management which all results in a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets loyal customers and expanding practice revenues 

  

cag diagnostics we refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as the idexx diagnostic advantage we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarian’s diverse needs through a variety of modalities including inclinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories v eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight 

  

the breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution during 2013 we reorganized our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in north america transitioning our specialty sales force that represented either inclinic or outside reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent all cag diagnostic modalities in addition to this reorganization we increased the size of our sales force resulting in smaller geographically sized sales territories these changes allowed for more frequent customer contact by a consistent sales professional we believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in north america 

  

 

our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and nonrecurring revenues revenues related to capital placements of our inclinic vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature while revenues from the associated proprietary vetlab consumables snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are recurring in nature instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than those provided by our recurring revenues especially in the case of vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits therefore the mix of nonrecurring and recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins 

  

diagnostic capital revenue revenues related to the placement of the vetlab suite of instruments are nonrecurring in nature in that the customer will buy an instrument once over the course of many years but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 

  

we place our catalyst dx chemistry analyzers through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest   instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2013 these two chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 35000 units a substantial portion of 2013 catalyst dx analyzer placements were to customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst dx placement at a vettest customer substitutes a catalyst dx consumable stream for a vettest consumable stream nonetheless we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest analyzer to a catalyst dx analyzer due to the superior capability flexibility and ease of use of the catalyst dx which leads to additional testing by the customer 

  

in addition to the catalyst dx analyzer we have beg u n preselling the catalyst one instrument and currently have a customer marketing program underway through which customers preordering a catalyst one are provided with the right to use a catalyst dx instrument through the catalyst one release date under this marketing program we do not recognize instrument revenue until delivery of the catalyst one instrument which we anticipate to occur throughout 2015 as we continue to experience growth in placements of catalyst   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of vettest analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

  

the procyte dx   analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte dx   and lasercyte   analyzers and vetautoread analyzers as of december 31 2013 these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 25000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte analyzer to a procyte dx analyzer however an increasing number of placements have been made at competitive accounts since the launch of this instrument in 2010 we also continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte dx and lasercyte instruments both new and refurbished as tradeups from the vetautoread analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2013 a significant number of lasercyte instruments that were placed were refurbished instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx   analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte and vetautoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

  

 

we seek to enhance the attractiveness of our snap rapid assay tests by providing the snapshot dx which automatically reads certain snap test results and records those results in the electronic medical record and the upcoming snap pro mobile device which activates snap tests captures and saves images of the results and records invoice charges in the patient record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced in addition the snap pro mobile device activates the test properly times the run and captures an image of the result which can be shared with pet owners on the snap pro screen or via vetconnect plus we anticipate the snap pro mobile device will begin shipping at the end of the first quarter of 2014 we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

  

our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing work flows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments in addition we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

  

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab station and vetconnect plus  client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

  

recurring diagnostic revenue revenues from our proprietary vetlab consumable products our snap rapid assay test kits outside reference laboratory and consulting services and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our vetlab instruments are considered recurring in nature our inclinic diagnostic solutions consisting of our vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits provide realtime reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions  our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with boardcertified veterinary specialists and pathologists combined with the benefit of sameday or nextday turnaround times 

  

we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in vetlab instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers 

  

our inclinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse superior performance sensitivity specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  

 

we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in several markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality turnaround time customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our inclinic offerings 

  

profitability from our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers we believe the reorganization of our sales force will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our inclinic diagnostic modalities in recent years reoccurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers and as a result of our upfront customer loyalty programs under these arrangements we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future 

  

health monitoring and biological materials testing  we believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market 

  

customer information management and digital imaging systems  our cornerstone practice management system provides a superior integrated information solution backed by exceptional customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including a quality client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inclinic vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits 

  

our digital imaging systems offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 

  

water 

  

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 51  of total water product sales in 2013 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe further we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition 

  

 

livestock poultry and dairy 

  

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease and reproductive management programs disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products 

  

our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages almost exclusively the snap platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and develop product line enhancements and extensions  

  

based on the episodic nature of disease outbreaks the performance of this business can fluctuate in 2013 lpd organic revenues declined approximately 1 resulting primarily from lower sales volumes of bovine tests resulting from changes in european testing requirements and lower sales volumes of dairy snap tests used for the detection of the contaminant aflatoxin m1 and antibiotic residues in milk 

  

in 2013 approximately 88 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other 

  

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals w e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

  

our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst dx platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

  

in 2013 approximately 83 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe the middleeast and asia the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates o n an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

  

multiple element arrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab suite of analyzers digital imaging systems or practice management software  combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 

  

we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element  

  

 

when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

  

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

  

customer programs  we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by endusers upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods the summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program these amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program these differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 

  

customer loyalty programs  our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period 

  

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points among other things these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab instruments digital imaging systems or cornerstone practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 

  

 

idexx vetlab instrument marketing programs  our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 at december 31 2013 a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 0 4 million 

  

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement 

  

idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage as idexx points are issued to customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end users which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via idexx smartservice  differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

  

following is a summary of revenue reductions net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  in thousands  

  



  



  

 

accrued customer programs are included within accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities depending on the anticipated settlement date in the consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form 10k following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and the ending accrued customer programs balance for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  in thousands  

  





  

inventory valuation 

  

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

  

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings 

  

 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments our dairy and opti medical businesses for which there is no goodwill associated are presented in our lpd and other segments respectively 

  

in evaluating goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would then perform step one of the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required in contrast we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the twostep impairment test doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

  

as part of our goodwill testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the twostep impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units 

  

as part of step one of the twostep impairment test we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows we make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions in addition we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit as of september 30 2013 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the company’s market capitalization valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 116 million to 15 billion and 123 to 1600 of the reporting unit’s carrying value 

  

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlooks for our reporting units actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 or 2011 

  

 

a prolonged economic downturn resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of future impairment tests an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a riskadjusted discount rate no impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

as a result of operating losses incurred during 2012 by our opti medical systems business in the human market we tested the related asset group including intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of 2012 simultaneously we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and determined that based on investments in our next generation opti analyzer it is likely we will experience a reduction in revenues from the existing products based on the acquired technologies sooner than previously estimated as a result we reduced the estimated useful lives for certain opti medical systems intangible assets resulting in increased amortization in the fourth quarter of 2012 and future periods 

  

as of september 30 2012 we determined the future net undiscounted cash flow for our opti medical systems business in the human market which is comprised of those cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset group exceeded the 17 million carrying value of the related asset group including intangible assets of 5 million by approximately 60 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 opti medical systems achieved operating profit and cash flows that exceeded our estimates used as of september 30 2012 therefore no impairment test was performed during the year ended december 31 2013 

  

inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results approved business plans expected growth rates and tax rates many of the factors used in assessing future cash flows are outside the control of management and changes in the assumptions or estimates could materially affect the future cash flows of an asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential future impairment of the asset in addition the performance of the business is subject to the various risks described above that are associated with our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market see “part i item 1a risk factors” no impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

  

 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

  





  

changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2013 was 105 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2013 would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2013 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million 

  

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2013 would have increased by 10 or decreased by 11 respectively and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2013 for options awarded during 2013 would have increased or decreased by 02 million 

  

sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors sharebased compensation expense is adjusted annually for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was 166 million which is net of a reduction of 30 million for actual and estimated forfeitures fluctuations in our overall employee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on sharebased compensation expense 

  

modifications of the terms of outstanding options may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2013 2012 or 2011 

  

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 totaled 222 million 182 million and 255 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2013 was 349 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years 

 

income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

  

on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2013 would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances 

  

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made     

  

our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by 03 million this decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

  

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 3498 million at december 31 2013 of which approximately 2781 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2013 no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the us we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 

  

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 66 million and 63 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 

  

 

results of operations and trends 

  

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

  

distributor purchasing and inventories  the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment are sold in the us and certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue 

  

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

  

consistent with our estimate as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we believe that our us cag distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of the anticipated enduser demand for vetlab consumables and rapid assay products at the end of a quarter 

  

currency impact  approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies   strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure additionally o ur designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on nonus denominated revenues 

  

the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nonus gaap measure we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period as exchange rates are an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 95 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen and the australian dollar 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2011 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately 190 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 

  

 

effects of economic conditions  demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by economic conditions since mid2008 in our cag segment we believe that low economic growth and relatively high unemployment have led to negative or cautious consumer sentiment which has affected the number of patient visits to veterinary clinics based on data provided by a subset of our customers that use our practice management systems we observed patient visits were flat to slightly down beginning in 2009 with a slight improvement in the growth of patient visits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 and further improvement during 2013 over the previous year periods although the rate of improvement has not been steady we believe that this data though limited provides a fair and meaningful representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us that is consistent with trends in the us economic environment and consumer sentiment in contrast economic conditions in certain european countries remain challenging which continues to negatively impact our cag segment in particular 

  

we believe that the overall trend in patient visits since the beginning of the economic downturn has had a slightly negative impact on the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in addition we believe the rate of growth of sales of our instruments digital radiography and practice management systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians has also been affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions weaker economic conditions since mid2008 have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower revenue growth due to limited price increases for certain products 

  

we also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers lower water testing volumes have resulted from a decline in discretionary testing and a decline in mandated testing as a result of lower home and commercial construction fiscal difficulties in certain european countries have also reduced government funding for some water and livestock testing programs 

  

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets have partially mitigated the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates looking forward we are cautiously optimistic that the improvements we began to see in the us commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012 and continuing in 2013 are reflective of a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment that over time will further reduce these effects 

  

effects of patent expiration  although the company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expected to expire during 2014 and 2015 the expiration of these patents or licenses individually or in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace the breadth quality and integration of our product offerings our existing customer relationships and our customer support our sales force the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies andor additional patents our significant knowhow scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings

revenue 

  

the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends 

  

 

organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are nonus gaap measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period 

  

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment   

  



  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag   

  



  

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue is due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagnostic services and our vetlab consumables 

  

vetlab consumables revenue growth was due to higher unit volumes and higher realized prices the increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base for our catalyst dx and procyte dx   instruments as a result of customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing from existing customers who upgraded to these instruments partially offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest chemistry instrument higher realized prices were the result of changes in certain distributor arrangements and list price increases the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported consumables revenue growth by approximately 1 

  

vetlab   service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

  

the increase in rapid assay product revenue was due primarily to both higher unit volumes and higher realized prices resulting from price increases and a change in a distributor arrangement higher sales volumes were driven by an increase in us canine practicelevel sales volumes and increased volumes of our canine pancreatitis products the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on revenue growth 

 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted from the impact of both increased testing volumes and price increases higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers increased testing volumes from existing customers and improved customer retention 

  

the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the impact of customer programs the impact from customer programs includes a reagent rental program that we launched in north america during the fourth quarter of 2012 under the reagent rental program vetlab instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the minimum purchase agreement instead of at the time we place the instrument 

  

the increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from higher support revenue due to an increase in our active installed base and revenue from pet health network pro which launched commercially in the first quarter of 2013 these favorable factors were partly offset by a decrease in digital radiography system placements 

  

water the increase in water revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of our colilert products and related accessories in europe and north america driven by new account acquisitions and higher average unit sales prices 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the decrease in lpd revenue resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of bse tests resulting from changes in european testing requirements and a reduction in sales volumes of our dairy snap tests used for the detection of the contaminant aflatoxin m1 and antibiotic residues in milk in early 2012 dairy snap sales volumes were favorably impacted by testing as a result of an aflatoxin m1 outbreak in china testing volumes in china subsided over the remainder of 2012 these unfavorable factors were partly offset by higher sales of certain bovine tests resulting from increased testing levels from government programs and higher sales volumes of certain poultry and swine tests 

  

in 2014 we anticipate lower sales volumes of bovine tests in europe resulting from the success of certain eradication programs and changes in testing requirements lower european bovine volumes are expected to reduce revenue by less than 10 million for the year ending december 31 2014 

  

other other revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as lower sales volumes associated with our pharmaceutical product line were almost entirely offset by higher sales volumes of consumables and accessories used with our opti medical instruments 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  



  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 54 from 52 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services vetlab consumables and to a lesser extent rapid assay products and volumerelated efficiencies realized throughout our reference laboratory operations 

 

water gross profit for water increased due primarily to higher sales the gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as the unfavorable impact of currency was mostly offset by higher average unit sales prices the unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year 

  

livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 55 from 59 partly offset by higher sales the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of currency higher manufacturing costs were due primarily to an increase in materials costs and lower production volumes in certain product lines the unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year 

  

other gross profit for other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50 from 42 due primarily to lower overall opti medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials costs and higher relative sales of consumables used with our opti medical instruments and milestone and royalty revenue earned from our remaining pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements both of which yield higher relative margins 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts increased due primarily to changes in certain currency exchange rates and a decrease in certain manufacturing costs partly offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs 

  

in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the us dollar the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year in these geographies the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” for the year ended december 31 2013 these variances were due primarily to the cost of products sold in japanese yen 

  

the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable capitalized variances 

  

we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” the increase in personnelrelated costs for unallocated amounts is due primarily to higher selfinsured healthcare costs during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year 

  

 

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

  



  

  

  



  

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased personnelrelated costs from investment in our commercial organizations in all major regions including the completion of our north american sales force expansion and associated marketing and consulting costs related to this transformation the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnelrelated costs and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and an increase in consulting and external development costs 

  

water the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing and general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs research and development expense for the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year 

 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs  including costs associated with the acquisition of a brazilian distributor and increased spending on promotional activities in the asia pacific region the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the brazilian distributor a portion of which will not recur partly offset by lower personnelrelated costs and a decrease in intangible asset amortization research and development expense during the year ended december 31 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year 

  

other operating expenses for other increased 25 million to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2013 due primarily to a 35 million milestone payment earned during the year ended december 31 2012 related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line partly offset by lower personnelrelated costs in our opti medical line of business the pharmaceutical milestone payment was not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business rather it was reflected as a reduction to general and administrative expenses as earned   

  

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 49 million to 121 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider “freight service company” partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as result of the resolution of the ftc investigation in february 2013 and proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider in march 2013 the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by us to the freight service company were not subsequently remitted to our freight carriers due to an employee fraud and a breakdown in internal controls both at the freight service company concluding in significant losses and the resulting bankruptcy in response we recorded a 39 million loss related to these unremitted amounts in general and administrative expense during the year ended december 31 2013 we continue to monitor the freight service company’s bankruptcy proceeding but we cannot be certain of any recovery at this time 

  

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 19 million for both the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

  

interest expense was 54 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 38 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes that we issued and sold through a private placement in an aggregate amount of 150 million in december 2013 the senior notes consist of 75 million of 394 series a senior notes due december 11 2023 and 75 million of 404 series b senior notes due december 11 2025 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our senior notes we anticipate interest expense to increase during 2014 as a result of the issuance of the s enior n otes 

  

 

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 287 for the year ended december 31 2013 and 316 for the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 was due primarily to the research and development “rd” tax credit for the year ended december 31 2012 the us legislation authorizing the rd tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period on january 2 2013 us federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an rd tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the rd tax credit through the year ending december 31 2013 because the related legislation was enacted in 2013 the full benefit of the rd tax credit related to the prior year’s activities was recognized in 2013 in addition higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate 

  

as of january 1 2014 the us rd tax credit has again expired and we will not benefit from this provision unless legislation renewing the program is enacted 

  

in 2014 it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to 04 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2013 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various tax jurisdictions

revenue 

  

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

  



  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

  



  

the increase in cag diagnostics recurring revenue is due primarily to increased volumes in both our reference laboratory diagnostic services and our vetlab consumables 

  

vetlab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes of consumables used with our catalyst dx instrument partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest chemistry instrument the increase in consumables used with our catalyst dx instrument resulted primarily from growth of our install base as a result of customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing for customers who upgrade from our vettest to our catalyst dx instrument higher sales volumes of consumables used with our procyte dx instrument also contributed to the increase in consumables revenue the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels contributed 1 to reported consumables growth 

  

vetlab   service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

  

the increase in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our canine combination test products driven primarily by higher average unit sales prices the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels was not significant to rapid assay revenue growth 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes and to a lesser extent price increases higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers due in part to geographic expansion and our customer loyalty programs in which customers are provided incentives in exchange for agreements to purchase services in future periods 

  

 

the decrease in cag diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to lower sales of our catalyst dx and lasercyte instruments partly offset by increased sales of our procyte dx instrument lower sales of our catalyst dx instrument were due primarily to lower average unit sales prices a decrease in volumes during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year as result of the initial launch of a catalyst dx instrument marketing program in north america during the third quarter of 2011 and the impact of fourth quarter placements in 2012 under the reagent rental customer program where vetlab instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the rental agreement    

  

the increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from an increase in placements of our practice management systems an increase in support and service revenue and   incremental revenue recognized under customer loyalty programs where revenue had been deferred at the time of systems placement 

  

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher colilert product sales volumes due to new account acquisitions 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the increase in lpd revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of our dairy snap tests used for the detection of antibiotic residue and the contaminant aflatoxin m1 in milk partly offset by lower bovine test sales resulting from the changes in european union testing requirements and declines in certain government programs effective july 1 2011 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bse in the european union was increased from 48 months to 72 months which is reducing the population of cattle tested for this disease revenue from bse testing products was less than 10 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 

  

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our opti medical instruments and related consumables 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher average unit sales prices of our canine combination rapid assay tests lower unit costs for consumables used in our vetlab instruments and the favorable impact of currency the net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year 

  

water gross profit for water increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 63 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs during the year ended december 31 2012 the timing of certain manufacturing costs during the year ended december 31 2011 and the favorable impact of currency the net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year 

  

 

livestock poultry and dairy gross profit for lpd decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 59 from 61 and lower sales the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs driven by lower production volumes in certain product lines partly offset by the favorable impact of currency the net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year 

  

other gross profit for other decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 42 from 48 partly offset by higher sales the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices in our opti medical line of business higher relative sales of opti instruments that yield lower margins and lower relative milestone revenue from our remaining pharmaceutical outlicensing arrangements 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts increased due primarily to a decrease in certain manufacturing costs the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable production volume variances incurred in our lpd business 

  

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

  



  



  

 

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs higher amortization expense of our intangible assets and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and increased external consulting and development costs 

  

water the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates general and administrative expense was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs 

  

livestock poultry and dairy the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased spending on promotional activities and lower personnelrelated costs general and administrative expense was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to lower personnelrelated costs and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

other operating expenses for other increased 06 million to 77 million for the year ended december 31 2012 due primarily to higher personnel  related costs in our opti medical line of business partly offset by a final 35 million milestone payment earned related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line earned during the year ended december 31 2012 that was incremental to a similar 30 million milestone payment earned during the year ended december 31 2011 

  

 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased 50 million to 72 million for the year ended december 31 2012 due primarily to lower personnelrelated costs lower legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the ftc investigation and the absence of legal and other fees incurred as result of the resolution of the uk office of fair trading investigation in november 2011 these favorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a payment related to the sale of certain raw material inventory in connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in 2008 that was recognized during the year ended december 31 2011 we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income of 19 million for the year ended december 31 2012 was generally consistent with interest income of 17 million for the same period of the prior year 

  

interest expense was 38 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 35 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility partly offset by lower effective interest rates 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 316 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 310 for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in the tax rate was due primarily to the expiration of the us rd tax credit 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition in 2013 we issued 150 million of our senior notes at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had 2791 million and 2240 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 1744 million and 1632 million respectively additionally at december 31 2013 we had remaining borrowing availability of 172 million under our 450 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs for the next twelve months these resources coupled with our ability as needed to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will be sufficient in the long term to fund our business as currently conducted 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us no provision has been made for the payment of us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences a determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us of our total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013 approximately 2781 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily securing various obligations was approximately 07 million as of december 31 2013 28 of the cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries was invested in money market funds restricted to us government and agency securities 4 5  was held as bank deposits 2 7  was invested in money market funds having investments in highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities as of december 

 

31 2013 approximately 59 of the cash and cash equivalents held by our nonus subsidiaries was held in us dollars 

  

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 

  

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital 

  

  



  

1 days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter the result of which is then multiplied by 9125 days 

2 inventory turns represent inventoryrelated cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarterend divided by the inventory balance at the end of the quarter 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

the following table presents cash provided used 

  





  

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 2460 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2224 million for the same period in 2012 the total of net income and net noncash charges excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements to a financing activity was 2632 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2427 million for the same period in 2012 resulting in incremental operating cash flows of 205 million driven primarily by the increase in net income deferred taxes and the receipt of a 35 million milestone payment earned during the year ended december 31 2012 related to the sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line the total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements decreased cash by 172 million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to a decrease of 203 million for the year ended december 31 2012 resulting in an incremental increase in cash of 31 million 

 

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements 

  



1 revisions were made on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2012 to correctly reflect 79 million of noncash investing activities embedded in accounts payable accrued liabilities and inventory on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012   see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about this revision 

  

the increase in cash provided by accrued liabilities during the year ended december 31 2013 was greater than the prior year due primarily to higher personnelrelated accruals including employee incentive programs commissions and other compensation related expenses the increase in cash used for purchasing inventories during the year ended december 31 2013 was less than the prior year due primarily to the timing of inventory receipts of slides used with our chemistry instruments during the year ended december 31 2012 higher revenues during the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period of the prior year were the driver of the increase in cash used by accounts receivable during the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in cash used by other assets was due primarily to investments in certain supply contracts and higher spending on prepaid maintenance related to software licenses during the year ended december 31 2013  

  

we historically have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by the payment of annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

  

investing activities cash used by investing activities was 861 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 581 million for the same period in 2012 the increase in cash used by investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 was due primarily to incremental purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of a brazilian distributor the incremental purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to investments to expand our worldwide headquarters in westbrook maine and investments in manufacturing equipment our acquisition of the brazilian distributor is described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

our total capital expenditure plan for 2014 is estimated to be approximately 80 million which includes capital investments in manufacturing equipment investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories 

  

financing activities cash used by financing activities was 1025 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to cash used of 1253 million for the same period in 2012 the decrease in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to the issuance of 150 million of senior notes an increase in net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and an increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options these favorable factors were most ly offset by an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock 

  

 

cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock increased by 2355 million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2013 we have repurchased 490 million shares during the year ended december 31 2013 we purchased 40 million shares for an aggregate cost of 3678 million compared to purchases of 15 million shares for an aggregate cost of 1323 million during 2012 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

  

in may 2013 we refinanced our prior 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 450 million the “credit facility” with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on may 8 2018 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date though the credit facility does not mature until may 8 2018 all amounts borrowed under the terms of the credit facility are reflected in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the credit facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the syndicate of such an event applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 125 percentage points above the london interbank offered rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate dependent on our leverage ratio or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 025 dependent on our leverage ratio 

  

in december 2013 we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate amount of 150 million of senior notes consisting of 75 million of 394 series a senior notes due december 11 2023 and 75 million of 404 series b senior notes due december 11 2025 collectively the “senior notes” under a note purchase agreement among the company and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein the “senior note agreement” the proceeds from the senior notes were used for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility 

  

we may prepay the senior notes in an amount not less than 50 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior no tes then outstanding at the principal amount so prepaid plus the applicable makewhole amount as set forth in the senior note agreement upon no more than 60 or less than 10 days’ written notice to the holders of the senior notes in addition in the event of a change in control of the company as defined in the senior note agreement or upon the disposition of certain assets of the company the proceeds of which are not reinvested as set forth in the senior note agreement at the option of the holders of the senior notes we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior no tes at a price equal the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

the senior note agreement contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company priority indebtedness fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates certain restrictive agreements and violations of sanctions laws and regulations the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined in the senior note agreement not to exceed 35to1 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreement 

  

net borrowing and repayment activity under the credit facility resulted in incremental cash provided of 960 million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year at december 31 2013 we had 2770 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit issued related to our worker’s compensation policy covering claims for the years ending 2009 through 2013 the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including payment defaults defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness and a change of control default the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with 

 

affiliates and certain restrictive agreements the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization not to exceed 3to1 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility   

  

cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and share purchases under employee stock purchase plans increased by 141 million during the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in the average exercise price 

  

other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

  

under our worker’s compensation insurance policies for us employees since january 1 2003 we have retained the first 250000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of 20 million in each of 2013 2012 and 2011 the insurance company provides for insurance claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we have recognized cumulative expenses of 06 million 06 million and 04 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our estimated liability for worker’s compensation was 12 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2013 therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respec tive claim years for the years ended on or pr ior to december 31 2011  based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of december 31 2013  as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 13 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies 

  

under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for us employees we retain claims liability risk up to  325000   300000 and  275000 per incident per year in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we recognized employee healthcare claim expense of  292 million  230 million and  210 million during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively which includes actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability we would have further obligations our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of december 31 2013 and 2012 was  43 million and  32 million respectively 

  

we have contingent commitments outstanding of up to 55 million related primarily to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 and due to the seller upon our achievement of certain revenue milestones we have not accrued for the commitments related to this intangible asset acquisition as we do not deem them to be probable of occurring as o f december 31 2013 

  

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below 

  







  

these commitments do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 63 million and deferred compensation liabilities of 2 8 million as of december 31 2013 as the timing of recognition is uncertain refer to note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manuf acturing operations and inventory supply contracts are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies   the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar   

  

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions if a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

  

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we were not hedging any specific significant transactions 

  

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2013 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions as a result no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

  

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase and sales totaled 1683 million and 1570 million at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively  at december 31 2013 we had 10 million in net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax expense 

  

our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2014 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by approximately 8 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

  

 

in may 2013 we refinanced our existing 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 450 million the “credit facility” with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on may 8 2018 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of the credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” increases borrowings under the credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 125 percentage points “credit spread” above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2013 were 277 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 16 based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at december 31 2013 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 20 million on an annualized basis 

  

  beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges  a t december 31 2013 we had 11 million in unrealized losses net of income tax benefit on interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities

description of business by segment 

  

during 20 12  we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary and bioresearch market s  which we refer to as the   companion animal group “ cag ”  water quality products “water” and products for livestock and poultry   health which we refer to as   livestock and poultry diagnostics “ lpd ” prior to the second quarter of 2010 we referred to our lpd segment as our production animal segment we also operate two smaller operating segments that comprise products for milk quality and safety “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments is combined and presented with one of our remaining pharmaceutical product lines and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 1 5 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 20 12 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and our product and service categories 

  

companion animal group 

  

cag offers a set of discrete products and services as described below the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services permit us to offer integrated diseasemanagement diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice and between the veterinary practice and its clients and provide us with scale in sales and distribution our objective is to provide veterinarians with the tools and services to enhance the pet owner experience with veterinary medical care while also growing veterinary practice revenues and improving staff efficiencies 

  

vetconnect ® plus  in the third quarter of 2012 we launched vetconnect ® plus a cloudbased technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from both idexx inhouse analyzers rapid assays and idexx reference laboratories in one place vetc onnect ® plus combines all results that have been run on a patient with idexx vetlab ® station and reference l ab oratories  and thus allows the veterinarian to easily see and trend patientspecific diagnostic results enabling greater me dical insight in addition vetc onnect ® plus provides instant mobile or i nternet access to results whether run at idexx reference labs or on inhouse equipment results can easily be printed or emailed from vetc onnect ® plus to pet owners or other veterinarians in this way vetc onnect ® plus can aid the veterinarian and the practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient’s care which can support greater compliance to care recommendations or preventive care protocols 

  

instruments and consumables 

  

we currently market an integrated suite of in house laboratory analyzers for use in providing reference laboratory quality diagnostic results in companion animal veterinary practices that we refer to as the idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers the idexx vetlab ® suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products all of which are described below 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

blood and urine chemistry    we sell two chemistry analyzers  the catalyst dx ® chemistry analyzer and the vettest ® chemistry analyzer  that are used by v eterinarians   to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assistance in diagnosing physiologic conditions both instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” a subsidiary of johnson  johnson based on ortho’s dry slide technology “catalyst dx ® slides” “vettest ® slides” or “slides” in addition the catalyst dx ® analyzer also uses dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by idexx at opti medical systems one of our whollyowned subsidiaries  blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin calcium creatinine blood urea nitrogen “ bun ”  and total protein tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels both analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the detection of early renal disease 

  

the catalyst dx ® analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer which was launched in 2008 the catalyst dx ® analyzer provides significantly improved throughput ease of use and menu   relative to the vettest ® analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes key easeofuse features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged  multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system the catalyst dx ® analyzer also enables automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx ® analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient sample s simultaneously to run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum and urine to perform 28 different chemistry and electrolyte tests and to automatically calculate other parameters and ratios important to blood chemistry analysis in addition the catalyst dx ® analyzer runs a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood allowing veterinarians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently  

  

our vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration 

  

our vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzer measures electrolytes blood gases glucose and ionized calcium and calculates other parameters such as base excess and anion gap these measurements aid veterinarians in diagnosing various disease states evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function the vetstat ® analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes the vetstat ® analyzer and its cassettes are manufactured by opti medical systems 

  

sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of idexx vetlab ® equipment 

  

hematology  we sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also called a complete blood count “cbc” these analyzers include the procyte dx ® hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry optical fluorescence and laminarflow impedance in its analysis the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and the newly launched lasercyte ® dx hematology analyzer which both use laserflow cytometry technology in their analysis and the idexx vetautoread ™ hematology analyzer in addition the procyte dx ® hematology analyzer the lasercyte ® dx hematology analyzer and the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids we also sell the coag dx ™ analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders 

  

the procyte dx ® analyzer is our premier hematology analyzer which we launched in 2010 the procyte dx ® analyzer provides significantly improved throughput accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the lasercyte ® and vetautoread ™ hematology analyzers the procyte dx ® analyzer provides up to 24 different blood parameters including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells for a more complete picture of a patient’s health the procyte dx ® is validated for nine companion animal species canine feline equine bovine ferret rabbit gerbil pig and mini pig with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species in january 2013 we launched the lasercyte ® dx hematology analyzer which combines the advanced capabilities of the original lasercyte ® hematology analyzer with several features of our procyte dx ® analyzer

production and supply 

  

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers 

  

i nstruments and consumables  significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include vettest ® analyzers and consumables catalyst dx ® consumables other than electrolyte consumables lasercyte ®   and lasercyte ® dx consumables and vetautoread tm  vetlyte ®  and procyte dx ® analyzers and consumables 

  

vettest ® and catalyst dx ® chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® and catalyst dx ® chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to idexx 

  

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032 which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other components  we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products 

  

certain components incorporated into our snap ® products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice we are required annually to purchase a minimum amount from moss equal to our average purchase volumes in 2004 2005 and 2006 annual price increases are capped at 3 pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing 

  

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

backlog 

  

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

  

  

competition 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services this competition is intensifying and increasing  as new competitors have entered our markets and some of our competitors have expanded the range of products and services offered to the companion animal veterinary market and expanded the geographic scope of their operations in addition we have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position will depend on our ability to develop proprietary or highly differentiated products and services  integrate our products develop and maintain effective sales channels attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

 

  

we compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies   to small businesses focused on animal health  our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers  our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services  which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

  









  

government regulation 

  

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products  we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import product s manufactured in montpellier france   to the u  s  for distribution 

  

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “ fda ” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated  mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act 

  

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity “ce” marking for their products 

  

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is re gulated by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ®  quantitray ®  filtamax   xpress ®  enterolert ®    and simplate ® for heterotropic plate counts products have been approved by the epa for use under various regulatory programs  w ater testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world 

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices  however   b efore products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fda approved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap ® betalactam antibiotic residue test product ha s been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

  

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti ® instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti ® products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti ®   products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application 

  

opti ®   medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

  

 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food medical device and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

  

our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy which include 

  



















  

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

  

  

  

 

our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability 

  

we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our catalyst dx ® and vettest ® consumables procyte dx ® hematology idexx vetautoread ™ hematology vetlyte ® e lectrolyte idexx vetlab ® ua ™ urinalysis vettest ® chemistry and coag dx ™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap ®   rapid assay devices water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and lasercyte ®   and lasercyte ® dx hematology analyzer s to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

  

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market   

  

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologic products which are products that include materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products with samples and with the environment there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could necessitate field actions that would require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits with their respective owners to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing as well as the pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems a decline in patient visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership in general or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all 

  

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

  

any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 26 26 and 25 respectively of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies to mitigate such foreign currency exposure we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars 

  

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

  

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the united states department of agriculture “usda” the us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap ® tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our dairy testing products require approval by the fda prior to sale in the us the manufacture and sale of our opti ® line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and these products require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the impact of one of our distributors becoming nonexclusive on our results of operations is uncertain 

  

on february 11 2013 the commissioners of the us federal trade commission “ftc” granted final approval of the agreement containing consent order to cease and desist “consent agreement” previously reached with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation into whether idexx had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act details about the ftc investigation and the resulting consent agreement are described in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

on september 28 2012 we entered into a modified agreement with mwi veterinary supply inc “mwi” that became effective january 1 2013 under this modified agreement mwi is permitted to carry any competitive products without restriction or potential negative consequence this agreement satisfies the requirements of the consent agreement that we may have exclusive distribution agreements with only two of the three largest us distributors of companion animal veterinary products the modification of our agreement with mwi will result in one or more of our competitors selling products through mwi which we expect will increase the field sales resources of mwi used by those competitors to sell their products under the modified agreement with mwi we will provide lower compensation to mwi on sales of our products since we will no longer receive the benefits of mwi’s exclusive focus on our products we expect to reinvest savings from this lower rate of compensation in other sales and marketing resources and the selling efforts of our other distributors we believe that the reallocation of these sales resources will help mitigate the potential effects of the loss of exclusive focus of mwi and the additional field sales resources used by our competitors however there can be no assurances that we will be able to fully mitigate the competitive effects of the changes in the nature of our agreement with mwi any reduction in the relative effectiveness of our overall selling efforts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations which we do not believe would be material 

  

our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

  

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

  

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with us distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days prior written notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

  

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive in addition multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

  

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results   

  

the market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 in february 2011 the european union’s standing committee on the food chain and animal health “scfcah” agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months effective july 1 2011 which further reduced the population of cattle tested in december 2012 the scfcah agreed to allow european union member states the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective march 2013 the demand for our bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes and could be further impacted by further changes that could be made in the future revenue from bse testing products was less than 10 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

increase in corporate hospital ownership and prevalence of buying consortiums could negatively affect our business   

  

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries furthermore an increasing percentage of individually owned veterinary hospitals in the us are participating in buying consortiums corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums that we believe are positive for our business decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums in particular banfield pet hospital to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations which could be material in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech inc our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

  

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market 

  

  risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

  

for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 41 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 43 and 41 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period 

  

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters or system failures 

  

the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

  

 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock and poultry testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee leipzig germany ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario and wetherby the united kingdom therefore interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a system disruption that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business 

  

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

  

we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

  

  the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

  

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures marketing programs changes in foreign currency exchange rates and litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

  

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

  

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings 

  

 

restrictions in our credit facility or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities 

  

our ability to satisfy our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility “credit facility” depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants  our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt and possibly on terms not deemed favorable 

  

  we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability   

  




 item 1b   unresolved staff comments 

  

  not applicable 

  

 




 item 2   properties 

  

  our worldwide headquarters is located on a companyowned 65acre site in westbrook maine where we occupy a 555900 square foot building utilized for manufacturing research and development marketing sales and general and administrative support functions   in 2011 we began the construction of a new 107000 square foot administrative building adjacent to our primary facility in westbrook maine  which we expect will be substantially complete in late 2013 

  

  additional property ownership and leasing arrangements with approximate square footage purpose and location are as follows 

  

  additional properties owned  

  







  

  additional properties leased  

  

















  

  we believe that our owned and leased properties are generally in good condition are wellmaintained and are generally suitable and adequate to carry on our business 

  




 item 3   legal proceedings 

  

in january 2010 we received a letter from the us federal trade commission “ftc” stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether idexx or others had engaged in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftc act” through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the “investigation” 

  

on december 5 2012 we entered into an agreement containing consent order to cease and desist “consent agreement” with the ftc staff to resolve the investigation the consent agreement which is ten years in duration specifies that idexx may have exclusive distribution agreements with two of the following three distributors mwi veterinary supply inc “mwi” butler schein animal health and webster veterinary   the ftc commissioners granted final approval of the consent agreement on february 11 2013 resulting in the final resolution of the investigation 

  

 

we continue to believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate applicable antitrust laws we have chosen to enter into the consent agreement because we believe this course will help us avoid long and costly litigation and that our business will not be materially adversely affected 

  

  from time to time we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

description of segments  during 2012 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary and bioresearch markets which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for livestock and poultry health which we refer to as livestock and poultry diagnostics “lpd” prior to the second quarter of 2010 we referred to our lpd segment as our production animal segment we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for milk quality and safety “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostic market “opti medical” financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments and about a product line and outlicensing arrangements remaining from our pharmaceutical business is combined and presented in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

  

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows a portion of corporate support function and personnelrelated expenses certain manufacturing costs corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories the difference between estimated and actual sharebased compensation expense and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses in our segment disclosure these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

  

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

  

companion animal group 

  

cag offers a set of discrete products and services as described below however our strategy is to provide these products and services as integrated diagnostic and information management solutions to veterinary practices that collectively create more value for the customer than the value derived from individual products and services and that provide strong incentives for the customer to adopt full idexx solutions and to remain longterm users of our products and services the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services permit us to offer integrated diseasemanagement diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice and between the veterinary practice and its clients and provide us with scale in sales and distribution our objective is to provide veterinarians with the tools and services to enhance the pet owner experience with veterinary medical care while also growing veterinary practice revenues and improving staff efficiencies 

  

instruments and consumables  within the idexx vetlab ® instrument line of business we seek to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information and performance features enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and improve practice efficiency and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments and the multiyear consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

  

during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables and therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross margins in this line of business in the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle placements are made primarily through sales transactions as the market for the product matures an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a longterm customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables 

  

 

our catalyst dx ® analyzer is our latest g eneration chemistry analyzer which was launched in 2008 we place our catalyst dx ® analyzer through sales leases rental and other programs in addition we continue to place vettest ® instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales as of december 31 2012 these two chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 33000 units 

  

a substantial portion of 2012 catalyst dx ® analyzer placements were to customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors sometimes referred to as competitive accounts generally placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue whereas the consumable stream associated with a catalyst dx ® placement at a vettest ® customer substitutes a catalyst dx ® consumable stream for a vettest ® consumable stream nonetheless we have found that the consumables revenues increase when a customer upgrades from a vettest ® analyzer to a catalyst dx ® analyzer due to the superior capability and flexibility of the catalyst dx ®  which leads to additional testing by the customer 

  

the procyte dx ® analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in the third quarter of 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte ® analyzer and vetautoread ™ analyzer as of december 31 2012 these three hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 24000 units a substantial portion of procyte dx ® analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their lasercyte ® analyzer to a procyte dx ® analyzer however an increasing number of placements have been made at competitive accounts since the launch of this instrument in 2010 while customers continue to upgrade from their lasercyte ® analyzer to a procyte dx ® analyzer we continue to place a substantial number of lasercyte ® instruments both new and refurbished as tradeups from the vetautoread ™ analyzer and at new and competitive accounts in 2012 a significant number of lasercyte ® instruments that were placed were refurbished instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a procyte dx ® analyzer as we continue to experience growth in placements of procyte dx ® analyzers and in sales of related consumables we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of lasercyte ® and vetautoread ™ analyzers and in sales of related consumables 

  

our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of realtime care testing workflows which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use faster time to results greater sample throughput broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample our strategy is to increase both drivers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing at the pointofcare for a variety of diagnostic purposes in connection with the purchase of instruments we also offer protocolbased rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers in addition we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis 

  

with all of our instrument product lines we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® station client communications capabilities education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

  

  

  

  

  

 

rapid assay products  our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse and superior performance including by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  

we also seek to enhance the attractiveness of our tests by providing the snapshot dx ® analyzer which automatically reads certain snap ® test results and records those results in the electronic medical record this promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced we continue to work on enhancing the functionality of the snapshot dx ® analyzer to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

  

reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in many markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of our competitive reference laboratories and competitive inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu technology employed quality customer service and tools such as vetconnect ® plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our point  of  care offerings 

  

revenue growth in this line of business is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers including through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions and the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers our upfront loyalty programs have been a source of revenue growth in 2012 2011 and 2010 under these arrangements we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future 

  

in november 2011 we acquired the research and diagnostic laboratory “radil” business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri radil provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers we believe the acquisition of radil allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and inclinic testing solutions in an adjacent market in 2012 we began to place procyte dx ® analyzers containing a more advanced and research focused user interface with customers in the bioresearch market 

  

profitability of our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements startup laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business 

  

  practice management and digital imaging systems and services  our strategy in the practice management systems line of business is to provide superior integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including superior client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality ease of use and connectivity with inhouse and reference laboratory test results pet health network pro online client communication tools and services complement the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before during and after the visit thereby driving more patient visits our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 

  

 

water 

  

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers primarily consist of water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support sales of water testing products outside of the us represented 51  of total water product sales in 2012 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

  

livestock and poultry diagnostics 

  

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have active research and development and inlicensing programs in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics with demand for tests primarily created by government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and to a lesser degree disease and reproductive management programs initiated by livestock and poultry producers disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products in addition increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can fluctuate in 2012 lpd revenues declined approximately 4 resulting primarily from lower sales of bovine test products due to the changes in european union testing requirements and declines in certain government programs in 2012 approximately 88 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us  most notably europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

other 

  

  dairy  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverages almost exclusively the snap ® platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection the majority of our sales in this business are international to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions  in 2012 approximately 86 of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the us most notably china and europe the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals w e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

  

  

 

our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat ®   and catalyst dx ® platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

  

in 2012 approximately 81 of our sales in the opti medical systems business were from markets outside of the us most notably europe the middleeast and asia the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap”  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 2i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

  

multiple element arrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers digital radiography systems or practice management software  combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab ® instruments digital radiography systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to six years in certain arrangements  revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future 

  

we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition as discussed above have been met for each element if available we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately we use thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when these arrangements include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we recognize revenue according to the mea policy stated above 

 

  when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

  

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

  

customer programs  we record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs which include enduser rebates and other volumebased incentives incentives may be provided in the form of idexx points credits or cash and are earned by endusers upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows 

  

customer loyalty programs  our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of idexx products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the period 

  

upfront customer loyalty programs  our upfront loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or idexx points upon entering multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services if a customer breaches its agreement it is required to refund a prorated portion of the upfront cash or idexx points these incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement if these upfront incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase idexx vetlab ® instruments digital radiography systems or cornerstone ® practice management systems product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer we monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial 

  

idexx vetlab ® instrument marketing programs  our instrument marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program these arrangements are considered meas in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate these differences were not material for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 at 

 

december 31 2012 a 5 change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximately 03 million 

  

reagent rental programs  our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multiyear agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables no instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation we recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables we determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on vsoe and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment the cost of the instrument is reclassified from inventory to equipment and charged to cost of product revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the rental agreement 

  

idexx points may be applied against the purchase price of idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us idexx points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs we estimate the amount of idexx points expected to expire or breakage based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage as idexx points are issued to customers on november 30 of each year unused idexx points earned before january 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

  future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain customer programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive in determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from endusers which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by endusers via idexx smartservice tm  a secure i nternet link that enables us to extract data and provide diagnostic service and support for certain idexx vetlab ® instruments through remote access differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition   

following is a summary of revenue reductions  net recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  in thousands  

  



  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the total accrued revenue reductions were 366 million 378 million and 233 million respectively accrued customer programs are included within accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities depending on the anticipated settlement date in the consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form 10k following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer marketing and incentive programs and the ending accrued customer programs balance for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010  in thousands  

  



  

inventory valuation 

  

we write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

  

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets including intangible assets contingent consi deration is included within the acquisition cost and is recognized at its fair value on acquisition date a liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

  

we assess goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist an impairment charge is recorded for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our cag operating segment our water and lpd operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 referred to herein as the technology reporting unit a substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business included in our “other segment” is associated with products that have been or that we expect to be licensed to third parties realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments our dairy and opti medical businesses for which there is no goodwill associated are also presented in our “other” segment 

  

on january 1 2012 we adopted an amendment to the accounting guidance for goodwill which simplified how companies test goodwill for impairment the amendment provides an entity the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the morelikelythannot threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it would then perform the twostep impairment test otherwise no further impairment test would be required 

  

as part of our goodwill qualitative testing process we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit examples of the qualitative factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include the results of the most recent impairment test the competitive environment anticipated changes in product or labor costs revenue growth trends the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and longrange financial forecasts the longrange financial forecasts of the reporting units which are based upon management’s longterm view of our markets are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we elected to assess the qualitative factors discussed above and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units comprising our cag water and lpd operating segments exceeded the respective carrying amounts therefore we did not perform the twostep impairment test for these reporting units a prolonged economic downturn resulting in lower longterm growth rates and reduced longterm profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment tests in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill depending on the outcome of a qualitative assessment and if necessary the twostep impairment test an impairment of goodwill would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings 

  

we did not elect to use the simplified qualitative approach to assess goodwill in our technology reporting unit due to the nature of these products that are dependent on the success of third parties to develop and commercialize therefore we performed the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows to estimate the fair value of the technology reporting unit valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows growth rates and discount rates the results of the technology reporting unit goodwill impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value of 7 million by approximately 160 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

while we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of our technology reporting unit are reasonable a change in assumptions underlying these estimates or the inability of third parties to successfully develop or commercialize these products could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value we use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for this reporting unit actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” derived from industry peers changes in market conditions interest rates growth rates tax rates costs pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of a reporting unit and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period no goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 or 2010 

  

we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a noncash charge to earnings if necessary we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset using a riskadjusted discount rate 

as a result of recent operating losses incurred by our opti medical systems business in the human market we tested the related asset group including intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of 2012 simultaneously we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and determined that based on investments in our next generation opti analyzer it is likely we will experience a reduction in revenues from the existing products based on the acquired technologies sooner than previously estimated as a result we reduced the estimated useful lives for certain opti medical systems intangible assets resulting in increased amortization in the fourth quarter of 2012 and future periods the impact of this change in estimated useful lives is not expected to have a material impact on our future financial results 

  

we determined the future net undiscounted cash flow for our opti medical systems business in the human market which is comprised of those cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the asset group exceeded the 17 million carrying value of the related asset group including intangible assets of 5 million by approximately 60 

  

inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results approved business plans expected growth rates and tax rates many of the factors used in assessing future cash flows are outside the control of management and changes in the assumptions or estimates could materially affect the future cash flows of an asset group and therefore could affect the amount of potential future impairment of the asset in addition the performance of the business is subject to the various risks described above that are associated with our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market see “part i item 1a risk factors” no impairments of intangible assets were identified during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

our sharebased compensation programs provide for grants of stock options restricted stock units and deferred stock units along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

  

  

  

  

  

 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no present intention to pay a dividend therefore we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates however substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

  



  



  

changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect the total fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december 31 2012 was 80 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1 the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2012 would have increased or decreased by approximately 3 and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2012 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than 01 million 

  

we derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises the expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date a longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect  if the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended december 31 2012 would have increased by 10 or decreased by 11 respectively and the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2012 for options awarded during 2012 would have increased or decreased by 02 million 

  

sharebased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which ranges from one to five years depending on the award sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 159 million which is net of a reduction of 29 million for actual and estimated forfeitures changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment of certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and therefore on sharebased compensation expense modifications of the terms of outstanding options may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2012 2011 or 2010 

  

the fair value of stock options restricted stock units deferred stock units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 totaled 182 million 255 million and 163 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2012 was 333 million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years 

 

  

income taxes 

  

we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

  

the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards net of valuation allowances was 43 million and 05 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2012 would not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances 

  

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by 03 million this increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

  

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 3145 million at december 31 2012 of which approximately 2224 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31 2012 no provision has been made for us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made a determination of related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually repatriated is not practicable for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis 

  

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 63 million and 56 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 

  

 

results of operations and trends 

  

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

  

distributor purchasing and inventories  the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment are sold in the us and certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue 

  

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

  

at the end of a quarter we believe that our us cag distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of the anticipated enduser demand for instrument consumables and rapid assay products 

  

currency impact  for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 26 26 and 25 respectively of idexx consolidated revenues were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies  strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure 

the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by us gaap otherwise referred to herein as a nonus gaap measure we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2011 changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced total company revenue by approximately 190 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2010 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total company revenue by approximately 271 million due primarily to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the australian dollar japanese yen canadian dollar british pound and swiss franc 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

effects of economic conditions  demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by economic conditions since mid2008 in our cag segment we believe that low economic growth and relatively high unemployment have led to negative or cautious consumer sentiment which has affected the number of patient visits to veterinary clinics based on data provided by a subset of our customers that use our practice management systems we observed patient visits were flat to slightly down beginning in 2009 with a slight improvement in the growth of patient visits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011 and further improvement during 2012 over the previous year periods although the rate of improvement has not been steady we believe that this data though limited provides a fair and meaningful representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the us that is consistent with trends in the us economic environment and consumer sentiment in contrast economic conditions in certain european countries remain challenging which continues to negatively impact our cag segment in particular 

  

we believe that the overall trend in patient visits since the beginning of the economic downturn has had a slightly negative impact on the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in addition we believe the rate of growth of sales of our instruments and digital radiography systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians has also been affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions weaker economic conditions since mid2008 have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower revenue growth due to limited price increases for certain products 

  

we also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers lower water testing volumes have resulted from a decline in discretionary testing and a decline in mandated testing as a result of lower home and commercial construction fiscal difficulties in certain european countries have also reduced government funding for some water and livestock testing programs 

  

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets have partially mitigated the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates looking forward we are cautiously optimistic that the improvements we began to see in the us commencing in the fourth quarter of 2011 and continuing in 2012 are reflective of a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment that over time will further reduce these effects

revenue 

  

the following revenue analysis and discussion reports on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends 

  

  organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are nonus gaap measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

  



  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag the vetlab ® instruments and consumables product and service category has been disaggregated into its three vetlab ® components 

  



  

the decrease in vetlab ® instruments revenue was due primarily to lower sales of our catalyst dx ® and lasercyte ® instruments partly offset by increased sales of our procyte dx ® instrument lower sales of our catalyst dx ® instrument were due primarily to lower average unit sales prices a decrease in volumes during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year as result of the initial launch of a catalyst dx ® instrument marketing program in north america during the third quarter of 2011 and the impact of fourth quarter placements in 2012 under the reagent rental customer program where instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the rental agreement  vetlab ® service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

  

vetlab ® consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales volumes of consumables used with our catalyst dx ® instrument partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest ® chemistry instrument the increase in consumables used with our catalyst dx ® instrument resulted primarily from growth of our install base as a result of customer acquisitions as well as an increase in testing for customers who upgrade from our vettest ® to our catalyst dx ® instrument higher sales volumes of consumables used with our procyte dx ® instrument also contributed to the increase in consumables revenue the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels contributed 1 to reported consumables growth 

  

the increase in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to higher sales of our canine combination test products driven primarily by higher average unit sales prices the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels was not significant to rapid assay revenue growth 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes and to a lesser extent price increases higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers due in part to geographic expansion and our customer loyalty programs in which customers are provided incentives in exchange for agreements to purchase services in future periods 

  

 

the increase in practice management and digital imaging systems and services revenue resulted primarily from an increase in placements of our practice management systems an increase in support and service revenue and   incremental revenue recognized under customer loyalty programs where revenue had been deferred at the time of systems placement 

  

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher colilert ® product sales volumes due to new account acquisitions 

  

livestock and poultry diagnostics the decrease in lpd revenue resulted primarily from lower bovine test sales resulting from the changes in european union testing requirements and declines in certain government programs effective july 1 2011 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” in the european union was increased from 48 months to 72 months which is reducing the population of cattle tested for this disease effective march 2013 european union “eu” member states will have the option to eliminate bse testing of healthy cattle at slaughter instead of eliminating testing certain eu governments have elected to further increase the age at which healthy cattle are to be tested in 2013 revenue from bse testing products was less than  10 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 

  

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of our dairy snap ® tests used for the detection of antibiotic residue and the contaminant aflatoxin m1 in milk higher sales of our opti medical instruments and related consumables also contributed to the increase in revenue in 2013 we anticipate reduced sales of dairy snap ® tests used for the detection of the contaminant aflatoxin m1 in milk due to lower testing volumes in china compared to testing that was performed in 2012 in response to an outbreak 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 



  

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily higher average unit sales prices of our canine combination rapid assay tests lower unit costs for consumables used in our vetlab ® instruments and the favorable impact of currency the net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year 

  

water gross profit for water increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 63 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs during the year ended december 31 2012 the timing of certain manufacturing costs during the year ended december 31 2011 and the favorable impact of currency the net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year 

  

  

  

  

  

 

livestock and poultry diagnostics gross profit for lpd decreased due to lower sales and a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 68 the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs driven by lower production volumes partly offset by the favorable impact of currency the net effect of currency was positive because the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to hedging losses during the same period of the prior year 

  

other gross profit for other increased due to higher sales partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 39 from 40 the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices in our opti medical line of business and higher freight and distribution costs in our dairy line of business these unfavorable factors were partly offset by lower overall manufacturing costs in our dairy line of business driven by increased production volumes of our snap ® tests 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts increased due primarily to a decrease in certain manufacturing costs the manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” the decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable production volume variances incurred in our lpd business 

  

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 



  



  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by the favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs higher amortization expense of our intangible assets and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and increased external consulting and development costs 

  

water the following table presents water expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates general and administrative expense was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs 

  

livestock and poultry diagnostics the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and lower personnelrelated costs general and administrative expense was generally consistent with the same period of the prior year the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to lower personnelrelated costs and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

  

  

 

other operating expenses for other which totaled 148 million for the year ended december 31 2012 were generally consistent with the same period of the prior year as higher personnelrelated costs in our opti medical line of business were offset by a final 35 million milestone payment earned related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line earned during the year ended december 31 2012 that was incremental to a similar 30 million milestone payment earned during the year ended december 31 2011   

  

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased 50 million to 72 million for the year months ended december 31 2012 due primarily to lower personnelrelated costs lower legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the us federal trade commission “ftc” investigation and the absence of legal and other fees incurred in connection with the uk office of fair trading “oft” investigation which concluded in november 2011 these favorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a payment related to the sale of certain raw material inventory in connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in 2008 that was recognized during the year ended december 31 2011 we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” the ftc investigation is discussed in more detail under the heading “part i item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k 

  

interest income and interest expense 

  

  interest income of 19 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 was generally consistent with interest income of 17 million for the same period of the prior year 

  

  interest expense was 38 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 compared to 35 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility partly offset by lower effective interest rates 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 316 for the year ended december 31 2012 and 310 for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in the tax rate is primarily due to federal research and development tax credits that were not available during 2012 but were available during 2011 partly offset by higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates 

  

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which retroactively reinstated and extended the federal research and development rd tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as a result the company expects its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will reflect the entire benefit of the rd tax credit attributable to 2012 we expect the federal rd tax credit reinstatement to contribute approximately a 2 reduction in our effective income tax rate for 2013 as compared to our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 

  

in 2013 it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to 11 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2012 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various us and international tax jurisdictions

the following revenue analysis and discussion reports on organic revenue growth organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to revenues reported in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers we exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends we exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends 

 

  

  organic revenue growth and the percentage changes in revenue from currency and acquisitions are nonus gaap measures see the subsection above titled “ effects of certain factors on results of operations ” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates the percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period 

  

revenue 

  

total company the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

  



  

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag the vetlab ® instruments and consumables product and service category has been disaggregated into its three vetlab ® components 

  



  

vetlab ® instruments revenue growth was due primarily to sales of procyte dx ®  the hematology analyzer that we began shipping during the third quarter of 2010 and higher sales volumes of our catalyst dx ® instrument these favorable impacts were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices driven primarily by discounts associated with our idexx vetlab ® instrument marketing programs vetlab ® service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments 

  

vetlab ® consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher sales of consumables used with our catalyst dx ® instrument partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest ® chemistry instrument as customers continue to upgrade from our vettest ® instrument to our catalyst dx ® instrument higher sales of consumables used with our procyte dx ® instrument also contributed to the increase in consumables revenue the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels contributed 1 to reported consumables growth 

  

  

  

 

the increase in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to an increase in us practicelevel sales of our canine combination test products and to a lesser extent sales of our feline pancreatitis test products which we began shipping during the second quarter of 2011 the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels was not significant to rapid assay revenue growth 

  

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volumes and to a lesser extent price increases higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers due in part to geographic expansion and our customer loyalty programs in which customers are provided incentives in the form of idexx points or cash in exchange for agreements to purchase services in future periods 

    

the increase in practice management and digital imaging systems and services revenue resulted primarily from an increase in service and support revenue and an increase in sales volumes of our practice management systems the increase in service and s upport revenue was due primarily to an increase in our active installed base of digital radiography systems and to a lesser extent practice management systems higher sales volumes of our digital radiography systems also contributed to the overall increase in revenue these favorable factors were partly offset by an increase in placements of digital radiography systems and practice management systems under our customer loyalty programs for which the related revenue is recognized in future periods 

  

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of colilert ® test products partly offset by the unfavorable impact of higher relative sales of colilert ® test products in geographies where these products are sold at lower average unit sales prices 

  

livestock and poultry diagnostics the increase in lpd revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of certain bovine tests and to a lesser extent higher sales volumes of certain swine and poultry tests the increased sales volume of certain bovine tests was driven primarily by sales in germany where we have won several government tenders for testing in connection with a countrywide eradication program for a virus impacting beef and dairy production yields 

  

other the increase in other revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes of our opti medical consumables and to a lesser extent instruments partly offset by lower sales volumes of our dairy snap ® tests used for the detection of antibiotic residue in milk and lower average unit sales prices in our opti medical line of business due in part to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices 

  

gross profit 

  

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

  



  

  

  

  

  

  

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 52 from 51 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to improvements in costs to manufacture our idexx vetlab ® instruments higher relative sales of products that yield higher margins and an overall increase in average unit sales prices driven by our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business these favorable impacts were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency as the net favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by the impact of increased hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

  

water gross profit for water increased as higher sales were partly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices of our colilert ® products and higher freight costs as a result of rising fuel surcharges these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of our colilert ® products that yield higher margins and lower manufacturing costs driven by cost improvement initiatives 

  

livestock and poultry diagnostics gross profit for lpd increased as higher sales were partly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the net unfavorable impact of currency as the net favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was more than offset by hedging losses during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to hedging gains during the year ended december 31 2010 this unfavorable impact was partly offset by lower manufacturing costs and higher relative sales of products that yield higher margins lower manufacturing costs were driven largely by benefits achieved from economies of scale as a result of the increase in production volume 

  

other gross profit for other decreased as higher sales were more than offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 40 from 44 the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices in our opti medical line of business and higher freight costs in our dairy line of business that were due in part to rising fuel surcharges 

  

unallocated amounts gross profit for unallocated amounts decreased due primarily to the unfavorable impact of certain manufacturing costs that we do not expect to continue at this level partly offset by a decrease in certain personnelrelated costs with respect to manufacturing costs the costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period we capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with us gaap we then record these costs as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold the impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent expense recognition is reported within the caption “unallocated amounts” with respect to personnelrelated costs we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” the decrease in certain personnelrelated costs for unallocated amounts is due primarily to lower selfinsured healthcare costs during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period of the prior year  

  

operating expenses and operating income 

  

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

  



 

  

  



  

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from an increase in personnelrelated costs the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales commission expenses attributable to the increase in sales volume the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology these increases were partly offset by a certain bad debt expense in 2010 that was absent in 2011 and payments that were earned during 2011 pursuant to certain product development arrangements and a license agreement the bad debt expense in 2010 was in connection with the bankruptcy of one of our us distributors professional veterinary products inc the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to increased personnelrelated costs and higher external consulting and development costs 

  

water the following table presents water expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnelrelated costs and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partly offset by a decrease in personnelrelated costs the slight decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from lower personnelrelated costs 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

livestock and poultry diagnostics the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

  



  

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in personnelrelated costs was due primarily to an increase in sales personnel to support growth in developing markets the slight increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partly offset by a decrease in personnelrelated costs the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to an increase in personnelrelated costs and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

other operating expenses for other increased 11 million to 147 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was due primarily to increased research and development costs in our opti medical line of business driven in part by higher personnelrelated costs and increased consulting and external development costs 

  

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased 35 million to 122 million for the year ended december 31 2011 due primarily to a decrease in certain personnelrelated costs receipt of a payment related to the sale of certain raw material inventory in connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008 an impairment charge in 2010 that was absent in 2011 a decrease in legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the ftc and oft investigations and decreased foreign exchange losses during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the ftc investigation is discussed in more detail under the heading “part i item 1a risk factors” we estimate certain personnelrelated costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments this allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” the decrease in certain personnelrelated costs for unallocated amounts is due primarily to lower selfinsured healthcare costs during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period of the prior year the payment related to the sale of certain raw material inventory was not recorded in our results of operation until received due to uncertain collectability the impairment charge in 2010 was to write off certain design costs related to a facilities project that had changed in scope 

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 17 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to 07 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest income was due primarily to interest earned on a note issued in connection with a november 2010 strategic investment in a company that owns and operates veterinary hospitals and to a lesser extent from higher cash balances 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

interest expense was 35 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to 24 million for the same period of the prior year in july 2011 we refinanced our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on july 25 2016 the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit facility” and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2011 in comparison to the same period of the prior year was due primarily to higher debt balances outstanding on our credit facility and higher effective interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility as a result of the refinancing event in july 2011 applicable interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility generally range from 0875 to 125 percentage points the range of applicable interest rates on borrowing under the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit spread” above the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” as opposed to a credit spread of 0375 to 0875 under the preexisting credit facility because the credit spread increased as a result of the refinancing event interest expense during the year ended december 31 2011 increased in comparison to the same period of the prior year 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective income tax rate was 310 for the year ended december 31 2011 and 301 for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in the tax rate is primarily due to lower tax benefits recognized related to the federal research and development tax credits lower benefits recognized in connection with the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and increased state tax 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we had 2240 million and 1839 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 1632 million and 873 million respectively additionally at december 31 2012 we had remaining borrowing availability of  87 million under our 300 million credit facility we believe that if necessary we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs for the next twelve months and that these resources will be sufficient in the long term to fund our business as currently conducted 

  

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us of our total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2012 approximately 2224 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily securing various obligations was approximately 16 million as of december 31 2012 36 of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was invested in money market funds restricted to us government and agency securities 42 was held as bank deposits 21 was invested in money market funds having investments in highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities as of december 31 2012 approximately 61 of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in us dollars 

  

  

  

  

 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 

  

the following table presents additional key information concern ing working capital 

  



  

sources and uses of cash 

  

the following table presents cash provided used 

  



  

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 2303 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2207 million for the same period in 2011 the total of net income and net noncash charges excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements to a financing activity was 2427 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2304 million for the same period in 2011 resulting in incremental operating cash flows of 123 million driven primarily by the increase in net income the total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements decreased cash by 124 million and 97 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively resulting in an incremental decrease in cash of 27 million 

  

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements 

  



  

  

 

incremental cash used by accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due primarily to the timing of vendor and income tax payments during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year the increase in inventories during the year ended december 31 2012 was more than the increase during the year ended december 31 2011 due primarily to the timing of inventory receipts most significantly of slides used with our chemistry instruments the amount and timing of revenues and customer payments was the primary driver of the cash used by accounts receivable during the year ended december 31 2011   

  

we historically have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by the payment of annual bonuses in connection with employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vectorborne disease testing which has historically resulted in significant increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year 

  

investing activities cash used by investing activities was 660 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 970 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in cash used by investing activities was due primarily to lower cash payments to acquire businesses during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year and the substantial completion in 2011 of investments in our memphis tennessee facility partly offset by increased investments in information technology and incremental investments during the year ended december 31 2012 to expand our headquarters facility in westbrook maine investments in information technology consisted of incremental costs to develop pet health network ® pro and increased purchases of computer hardware during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year during the year december 31 2012 we paid an aggregate of 27 million in cash to acquire three businesses compared to 468 million paid in cash to acquire three businesses during the prior year we accounted for all of the businesses acquired in 2012 and 2011 as business combinations 

  

our total capital expenditure plan for 2013 is estimated to be approximately 75 million which includes approximately 21 million for the expansion of our headquarters facility in westbrook maine 16 million of investments in internal use software and information technology infrastructure 12 million of capital investments in manufacturing equipment and 10 million for investments in our reference laboratory equipment and facilities 

  

financing activities cash used by financing activities was 1253 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to cash used of 977 million for the same period in 2011 the increase in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to net payments under the credit facility for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to net borrowing for the same period of the prior year and a decrease in cash received from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans and the related tax benefit partly offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock 

  

cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by 1232 million during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year from the inception of our share repurchase program in august 1999 to december 31 2012 we have repurchased 451 million shares during the year ended december 31 2012 we purchased 15 million shares for an aggregate cost of 1323 million compared to purchases of 34 million shares for an aggregate cost of 2555 million during 2011 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

  

cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and share purchases under employee stock purchase plans and the related tax benefits decreased by 60 million during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the number of stock options exercised 

  

  

  

  

  

 

net borrowing and repayment activity under our credit facility resulted in incremental cash used of 1449 million during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year at december 31 2012 we had 2120 million outstanding under the credit facility the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit issued related to our worker’s compensation policy covering claims for the years ending 2009 through 2012 the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility which includes customary events of default including without limitation payment defaults defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants the inaccuracy of representations or warranties bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults defaults relating to judgments certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the failure to pay specified indebtedness and a change of control default the credit facility contains affirmative negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type the negative covenants include restrictions on liens indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company fundamental changes investments transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the credit facility not to exceed 3to1 at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility    

  

other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

  

under our worker’s compensation insurance policies for us employees since january 1 2003 we have retained the first 250000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities per year of 20 million in 2012 and 2011 and 29 million in 2010 the insurance company provides for insurance claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we have recognized cumulative expenses of 07 million 04 million and 08 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our estimated liability for worker’s compensation as of december 31 2012 and 2011 was 12 million and 07 million respectively claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 are relatively undeveloped as of december 31 2012 therefore it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respective claim years for the eight years ended on or prior to december 31 2010 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year our maximum liability at december 31 2012 in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material in connection with these policies we have outstanding letters of credit totaling 13 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims 

  

we have contingent commitments outstanding of up to 75 million related primarily to the acquisition of an intangible asset in 2008 and due to the seller upon our achievement of certain revenue and other milestones we have not accrued for the commitments related to this intangible asset acquisition as we do not deem them to be probable of occurring as of december 31 2012 the remaining commitments are not material 

  

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below 

  



  

  





  

these commitments do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 59 million and deferred compensation liabilities of 23 million as of december 31 2012 as the timing of recognition is uncertain refer to note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 26 26 and 25 respectively of idexx consolidated revenues were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies  the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar   

  

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are either recognized in earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income “oci” net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings  we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

  

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we were not hedging any specific significant transactions 

  

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2012 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year that are in excess of amounts previously hedged accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

  

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase and sales outstanding at december 31  2012 and 2011 was 1570 million and 1618 million respectively at december 31 2012 we had 04 million in net unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of less than 01 million in taxes 

  

our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2013 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by approximately 8 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

  

 

in 2011 we refinanced our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on july 25 2016 the new credit facility is referred to as the “credit facility” we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of our credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” increases borrowings under our credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 125 percentage points “credit spread” above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2012 were 212 million at a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 13 based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at december 31 2012 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 17 million on an annualized basis 

  

    in 2009 we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations under these agreements beginning on march 31 2010 the variable interest rate associated with 80 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 2 plus the credit spread through march 30 2012 in august 2011 we entered into two additional forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for the same purpose under these agreements beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 and beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities

description of business by segment 

 

during 2011 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for livestock and poultry health which we refer to as livestock and poultry diagnostics “lpd” prior to the second quarter of 2010 we referred to lpd as our production animal segment we also operate two smaller operating segments that comprise products for milk quality and safety “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market “opti medical” financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments is combined and presented with one of our remaining pharmaceutical product lines and our outlicensing arrangements in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and our product and service categories

  

companion animal group 

 

instruments and consumables 

 

we currently market an integrated suite of inclinic laboratory analyzers for use in providing reference laboratory quality diagnostic results in companion animal veterinary practices that we refer to as the idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers the idexx vetlab ® suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products all of which are described below

 

blood and urine chemistry  we sell two chemistry analyzers the catalyst dx ® chemistry analyzer and the vettest ® chemistry analyzer that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assistance in diagnosing physiologic conditions both instruments use consumables manufactured for idexx by orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” a subsidiary of johnson  johnson based on ortho’s dry slide technology “catalyst dx ® slides” “vettest ® slides” or “slides” in addition the catalyst dx ® analyzer also uses dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by idexx at opti medical systems one of our whollyowned subsidiaries blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase albumin creatinine blood urea nitrogen “bun” and total protein tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels both analyzers also run a urine test called urine proteincreatinine ratio which assists in the detection of early renal disease

 

the catalyst dx ® analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer which was launched in 2008 the catalyst dx ® analyzer provides significantly improved throughput ease of use and menu relative to the vettest ® analyzer including the ability to run electrolytes key easeofuse features include the ability to run whole blood using an onboard centrifuge the ability to run prepackaged multislide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system the catalyst dx ® analyzer also enables automated dilutions which is an easeofuse feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine proteincreatinine ratio the catalyst dx ® analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously to run different sample types including whole blood plasma serum and urine to perform 28 different chemistry and electrolyte tests and to automatically calculate other parameters and ratios important to blood chemistry analysis

 

our vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration

 

our vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzer measures electrolytes blood gases glucose and ionized calcium and calculates other parameters such as base excess and anion gap these measurements aid veterinarians in diagnosing various disease states evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function the vetstat ® analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes the vetstat ® analyzer and its cassettes are manufactured by opti medical systems

 





 

sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of idexx vetlab ® equipment

 

hematology  we sell three hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets also called a complete blood count “cbc” these analyzers include the procyte dx ® hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry optical fluorescence and laminarflow impedance in its analysis the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry technology in its analysis and the idexx vetautoread ™ hematology analyzer we also sell the coag dx ™ analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders

 

the procyte dx ® analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in the third quarter of 2010 the procyte dx ® analyzer provides significantly improved throughput accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the lasercyte ® and vetautoread ™ hematology analyzers the procyte dx ® analyzer provides validated results for five species canine feline equine bovine and ferret for up to 24 different blood parameters providing a more complete picture of each patient’s health

 

quantitative immunoassay testing  with multiplepatient testing functionality the snapshot dx ® analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total thyroxine “t 4 ” cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function the snapshot dx ® analyzer also reads interprets and records the results of many idexx rapid assay snap ® tests including our canine snap ® 4dx ® test feline snap ® fivfelv combo test canine snap ® cpl ™ test feline snap ® fpl ™ test snap ® feline triple test and canine snap ® heartworm rt test

 

urinalysis  the idexx vetlab ® ua ™ analyzer provides rapid semiquantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use

 

idexx vetlab ® station  the idexx vetlab ® station “ivls” connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the idexx vetlab ® equipment and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability we sell the ivls as an integral component of the catalyst dx ®  lasercyte ® and procyte dx ® analyzers and also as a standalone hardware platform the ivls includes a user interface to input patient information connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers ivls also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the idexx vetlab ® suite stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap ® test results and sends and receives information from practice management systems including the idexx cornerstone ® system as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems ivls also connects back to idexx through smartservice tm  a secure internet link that enables us to provide diagnostic service and support for certain idexx vetlab ® instruments through remote access

 

rapid assays 

 

we sell a broad range of singleuse handheld test kits under the snap ® name that provide quick accurate and convenient diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these kits work without the use of instrumentation although many kits may also be read automatically by the snapshot dx ® analyzer as discussed above

 

principal singleuse canine tests include  

  

  

  

  

  





 

  

  

principal singleuse feline tests include 

  

  

  

  

 

sales of canine parasite tests including snap ® 4dx ®  snap ® 3dx ® and snap ® heartworm rt are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice

 

in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek ® name for canine heartworm fiv and felv larger clinics and laboratories use these kits to test multiple samples and provide easeofuse and cost advantages to highvolume customers

 

we expect to introduce snap ® 4dx ® plus to the us market during the second quarter of 2012 pending approval from the us department of agriculture “usda” this next generation product tests for two additional tickborne analytes ehrlichia ewingii and anaplasma platys  in addition to those analytes currently tested by snap ® 4dx ® 

 

reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services 

 

reference laboratory diagnostic services we offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians in the us canada europe australia japan south africa china and south korea and to bioresearch customers in the us and europe customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities most test results have sameday or nextday turnaround times our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals including virtually all tests that can be run inclinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays this menu of tests also includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant diseases in dogs and cats including heart disease pancreatitis and certain infectious diseases

 

in november 2011 we acquired the research and diagnostic laboratory “radil” business of the college of veterinary medicine from the university of missouri radil provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers the financial results of radil are reflected in the financial results of our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services business the acquisition of radil did not have a material effect on our results of operation in 2011 and are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operation in 2012

 

consulting services additionally we provide specialized veterinary consultation telemedicine and advisory services including radiology cardiology internal medicine and ultrasound consulting these services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by distributors outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide through our direct sales force we market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force and through distributors primarily in the us and canada we market our water livestock and poultry and dairy products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force we sell our opti ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti ® products primarily through distributors and other resellers

 

our largest customers are our us distributors of our products in the cag segment one of our cag distributors butler schein animal health supply llc “butler” accounted for 9 of our revenue in each of 2011 and 2010 butler was formed in december 2009 when butler animal health supply llc combined with the us animal health business of henry schein inc together these organizations accounted for 10 of our revenue in 2009

 

research and development 

 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and external consulting and development costs were 760 million 686 million and 651 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively or 62 of revenue in 2011 and 2010 and 63 of revenue in 2009

 

patents and licenses 

 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties

 

important patents and licenses include

 

        

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 





  

production and supply 

 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers

 

instruments and consumables 

 

significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include vettest ® analyzers and consumables catalyst dx ® consumables other than electrolyte consumables lasercyte ® consumables and vetautoread ™  vetlyte ®  coag dx ™ and procyte ® analyzers and consumables

 

vettest ® slides and catalyst dx ® chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® slides and catalyst dx ® chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements through 2012 the agreements provide for price increases based upon the us producer price index starting in 2013 the agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment the agreements also prohibit ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to idexx

 

we purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms ranging up to 21 years which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 

other components 

 

we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers these products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay and dairy devices livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products

 

certain components incorporated into our snap ® products are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that moss may terminate with 24 months notice we are required annually to purchase a minimum amount from moss equal to our average purchase volumes in 2004 2005 and 2006 annual price increases are capped at 3 pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing

 

we have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales

  

competition 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services this competition is intensifying and increasing as new competitors have entered our markets and some of our competitors have expanded the range of products and services offered to the companion animal veterinary market and expanded the geographic scope of their operations in addition we have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position will depend on our ability to develop proprietary or highly differentiated products and services integrate our products develop and maintain effective sales channels attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources

 





 

we compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do

 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below

 

     

government regulation 

 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing distribution marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses

 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products and are required to obtain special approval to import products into to the us for distribution from our manufacturing facility in montpellier france we have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee our manufacturing facility in montpellier france has been approved by aphis and we have a permit to import products manufactured in montpellier france to the us for distribution

 





 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the us fda under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated mislabeled or misbranded under the fdc act

 

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity “ce” marking for their products

 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ®  quantitray ®  filtamax ®  enterolert ®  and simplate ® for heterotropic plate counts products have been approved by the epa the sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world

 

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs are regulated by the fda as veterinary medical devices however before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fda approved protocol administered by an independent body such as the association of analytical communities research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap ® betalactam antibiotic residue test products have been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri for sale in the us while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes

 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti ® instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti ® products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti ® products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing and which are submitted as a 510k application

 

opti ® medical products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold

 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food medical device and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

 

employees 

 

at february 10 2012 we had approximately 5100 fulltime and parttime employees

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report

 





 

our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the companion animal health care industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy which include

 

          

if we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted

  

our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability 

  

we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our procyte dx ® hematology idexx vetautoread ™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte idexx vetlab ® ua ™ urinalysis vettest ® chemistry and coag dx ™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems catalyst dx ® and vettest ® consumables and certain components and raw materials used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek when possible to enter into longterm contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or as in the case of our contract with moss inc “moss” require us to compensate the supplier moss supplies us with certain components incorporated into our snap ® products if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of sole and single source products in the future we may be unable to supply the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 





  

  

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market 

 

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria further products that meet release criteria may fall out of specification while in customer inventory which could necessitate field actions that would require the company to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products and could damage customer relations our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services or increased customer credit risk 

  

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing and the pet owner compliance with these recommendations economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests comply with a treatment plan or even more fundamentally continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems a decline in pet visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products and by users of our human pointofcare diagnostic instruments economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

in all of our markets a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all

 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

 

any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against nonus currencies and in particular the euro british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 26 25 and 24 respectively of our revenue was derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies to mitigate such foreign currency exposure we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars

 





 

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the united states department of agriculture “usda” the us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications including most rapid assay canine and feline snap ® tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our opti ® line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and these products require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

  

the duration and resolution of the ftc investigation into our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services are unpredictable 

  

in january 2010 we received a letter from the us federal trade commission “ftc” stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether idexx or others have engaged in or are engaging in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftc act” through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the letter requested that we preserve all materials potentially relevant to this investigation the letter stated that the ftc has not concluded that idexx or anyone else has violated section 5 of the ftc act

 

we received subpoenas from the ftc on april 15 2010 and august 8 2011 requesting that we provide the ftc with documents and information relevant to this investigation and we are cooperating fully with the ftc in its investigation we believe that the ftc staff is nearing conclusion of its investigations and that the ftc is commencing its internal process to determine whether to file a complaint against idexx in the administrative law court within the ftc we now understand that the ftc is considering whether idexx has violated section 2 of the sherman antitrust act and is not focusing on potential violations of section 5 of the ftc act in an administrative action the ftc would have the power to seek prospective remedies but not financial penalties

 

we believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate applicable antitrust laws however we cannot predict whether the ftc investigation will lead to an enforcement proceeding or what the outcome of that proceeding would be were this investigation to lead to an enforcement proceeding we would defend ourselves vigorously were we to be unsuccessful in defending this proceeding and any applicable appeals we could be subject to restrictions on certain of our marketing and sales practices while we cannot be certain about what prospective remedies would be sought by the ftc in any such proceeding we believe that any required changes in our marketing or sales practices would not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements

 

our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

  

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us

 





 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights

 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations

 

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph see “part i item 1 business – marketing and distribution” in our annual report on form 10k for additional information

  

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

  

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways new competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services which could be superior to our products and services in addition multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through comarketing or other arrangements which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering similar products and services to ours at lower sales prices which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive

 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

 

the market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 





 

effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 in february 2011 the european union’s standing committee on the food chain and animal health agreed to allow its member states to further raise the recommended testing age to 72 months effective july 1 2011 which is further reducing the population of cattle tested the demand for our bse testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of these regulatory changes

 

increase in corporate hospital ownership could negatively affect our business 

 

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results of operations while we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups that we believe are positive for our business decisions by larger corporate owners in particular banfield pet hospital to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations which could be material in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline

  

our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

  

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience and small scale in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market

  

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

  

for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 43 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us compared to 41 for the year ended december 31 2010 various possible risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales including disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements natural disasters and unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets further prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results of operations for that period

  





  

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters or system failures 

  

the operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events

 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock and poultry testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine certain of our companion animal products as well as our human pointofcare products are manufactured in roswell georgia we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia markham ontario and wetherby the united kingdom therefore interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

 

we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a system disruption that impacts any of our critical functions it could result in the loss of sales and customers financial misstatement and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business

 

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations

 

we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

 

the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition

 

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures changes in foreign currency exchange rates litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall

 

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

 





 

restrictions in our credit facility or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may limit our activities

 

in july 2011 we refinanced our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit facility the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit facility” in the principal amount of 300 million our ability to satisfy our obligations under the credit facility depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable affirmative negative and financial covenants  our failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt and possibly on terms not deemed favorable

 

we fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility if we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 26 25 and 24 respectively of idexx sales were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar 

 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are either recognized in earnings or deferred in other comprehensive income “oci” net of tax and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings we primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months

 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions

 





 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2011 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases and sales provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year that are in excess of amounts previously hedged accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle

 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchases and sales outstanding at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 1618 million and 1332 million respectively at december 31 2011 we had 41 million in net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 10 million in taxes

 

our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2012 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar would reduce operating income by approximately 8 million the impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have

 

in july 2011 we refinanced our existing 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of 300 million with a syndicate of multinational banks which matures on july 25 2016 the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit facility” we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of our credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” increases borrowings under our credit facility bear interest in the range from 0875 to 125 percentage points the range of applicable interest rates on borrowing under the new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “credit spread” above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2011 were 2430 million at a weightedaverage interest rate of 17 based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2011 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 16 million on an annualized basis

 

in 2009 we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations under these agreements beginning on march 31 2010 the variable interest rate associated with 80 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility became effectively fixed at 2 plus the credit spread through march 30 2012 in august 2011 we entered into two additional forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for the same purpose under these agreements beginning on march 30 2012 the variable interest rate associated with 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 136 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 and beginning on march 28 2013 the variable interest rate associated with an additional 40 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility will become effectively fixed at 164 plus the credit spread through june 30 2016 we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities

certain components incorporated into our snap ® products are supplied by moss inc “moss” under a supply agreement that moss may terminate with 24 months notice we are required annually to purchase a minimum amount from moss equal to our average purchase volumes in 2004 2005 and 2006 annual price increases are capped at 3 pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render moss incapable of supplying the components to us if such a triggering event occurs we will make royalty payments to moss for the use of such information until moss is able to again begin manufacturing 

we have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services this competition is intensifying and increasing as new competitors have entered our markets and some of our competitors have expanded the range of products and services offered to the companion animal veterinary market and expanded the geographic scope of their operations in addition we have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position will depend on our ability to develop proprietary or highly differentiated products and services integrate our products develop and maintain effective sales channels attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  

  

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing marketing and promotion labeling recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the fdc act 

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity “ce” marking for their products 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ®  quantitray ®  filtamax ®  enterolert ®  and simplate ® for heterotropic plate counts products have been approved by the epa the sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world 

  

  

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs are regulated by the fda before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fda approved protocol administered by aoac research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap ® betalactam dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti ® instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti ® products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti ® products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k application 

opti ® products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food medical device and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors”

risk factors 

tableend 

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the companion animal health care industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability 

we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our procyte dx ™ hematology idexx vetautoread ™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte idexx vetlab ® ua ™ urinalysis vettest ® chemistry and coag dx ™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems catalyst dx ® and vettest ® consumables and certain components and raw materials used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products livestock and poultry diagnostic tests dairy testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we seek where possible to enter into longterm contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however some suppliers decline to enter into longterm contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis there can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products in cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply in addition under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of sole and single source products in the future we may be unable to supply the market which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market 

many of our rapid assay livestock and poultry diagnostic water and dairy products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to diagnostic testing economic weakness in our significant markets in recent years has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to treat certain pet health conditions approve certain diagnostic tests or continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments a decline in pet visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services this in turn may cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided 

demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at the government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products availability of funds also affects demand by the government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products economic weakness in our significant markets has caused and could continue to cause our consumers to reduce their investment in such testing 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the japanese yen and the australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in us dollars and exported to international markets for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 25 24 and 24 respectively of idexx sales were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies to mitigate such foreign currency exposure we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts a strengthening us dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars 

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the united states department of agriculture “usda” the us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our opti ® line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and these products require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the duration and resolution of government investigations into our marketing and sales practices for companion veterinary products and services is unpredictable 

in january 2010 we received a letter from the us federal trade commission “ ftc” stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether idexx or others have engaged in or are engaging in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftc act” through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the letter requested that we preserve all materials potentially relevant to this investigation the letter stated that the ftc has not concluded that idexx or anyone else has violated section 5 of the ftc act 

  

  

we received a subpoena from the ftc on april 15 2010 requesting that we provide the ftc with documents and information relevant to this investigation and we are cooperating fully with the ftc in its investigation we cannot predict how long any investigation might be ongoing 

in november 2010 we received notification that the united kingdom office of fair trading “oft” was conducting an investigation to determine whether idexx had engaged in or is engaging in practices foreclosing the supply of companion animal diagnostic testing services in violation of the united kingdom competition act of 1998 we have provided the oft with documents and information relevant to this investigation as requested and we are cooperating fully with the oft on this matter we cannot predict how long any investigation might be ongoing 

we believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate the antitrust laws of the us uk or any other country however we cannot predict whether government investigations will lead to enforcement proceedings or what the outcomes of those proceedings will be were any investigation to lead to an enforcement proceeding we would defend ourselves vigorously even if we were required to change one or more of our marketing or sales practices as a result of any enforcement proceeding we do not believe that any such change would have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights in june 2009 one of the us patents covering our snap ® fivfelv combo and snap ® feline triple tests expired we had licensed this broad patent exclusively from the university of california expiration of this patent could result in increased competition in the us market for feline immunodeficiency virus tests and if this competition arises we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with sales of our snap ® fivfelv combo and snap ® feline triple tests will likely decline 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the unanticipated loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph see “part 1 item 1 business – marketing and distribution” 

  

  

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition will become even more intense the introduction by competitors of new and competitive products and services could result in a decline in sales andor profitability of our products and services in addition competitors may develop products or services that are superior to our products and services which could cause us to lose existing customers and market share some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

the market for our companion animal and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our livestock and poultry dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which reduced the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 it is likely that the european union will increase the recommended testing age again which will further reduce the population of cattle tested depending on the extent to which each country in the european union decides to adopt the new guidelines the demand for this product may be impacted as a result of this and future regulatory changes 

consolidation of veterinary hospitals could negatively affect our business 

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results decisions by larger corporate owners to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their reference laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories furthermore because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

our limited experience in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

we have limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market this market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our limited experience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market 

  

  

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2010 41 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period 

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural disasters or system failures 

the operation of all of our facilities is vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

we manufacture many of our significant companion animal products including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock and poultry testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine we also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in bern switzerland and montpellier france in addition we maintain major distribution facilities in north america and in the netherlands and major reference laboratories in memphis tennessee ludwigsburg germany sacramento california elmhurst illinois north grafton massachusetts east brisbane australia and wetherby the united kingdom therefore interruption of operations at any of these facilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records process customer orders manage inventory process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions if we were to experience a system disruption in the information technology systems that enable us to interact with customers and suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business 

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being off the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

the loss of our president chief executive officer and chairman could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w ayers our president chief executive officer and chairman we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr ayers the loss of mr ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

  

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives or if they expire or are renewed at less favorable terms our inability to realize these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

description of segments  during 2010 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technologybased products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for livestock and poultry health which we refer to as the livestock and poultry diagnostics “lpd” prior to the second quarter of 2010 we referred to lpd as our production animal segment we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for milk quality “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostic market “opti medical” financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments and other licensing arrangements is combined and presented in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2010 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories a portion of sharebased compensation expense interest income and expense and income taxes in our segment disclosure of gross profit operating expenses and operating income these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts” we estimate our sharebased compensation expense for the year and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company resulting in an unallocated amount reported under the unallocated category 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services give us scale in sales and distribution permit us to offer integrated diseasemanagement diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing and facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems with reference laboratory test data inclinic test data from our idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers and rapid assay tests and radiographic data from the idexxpacs ™ and idexx equiview pacs ™ software generated by our digital radiography systems 

 

instruments and consumables  our strategy in our idexx vetlab ® instrument line of business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information and performance features enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and improve practice efficiency and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

 

during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables and therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross margins in this line of business 

 

  

  

our catalyst dx ® analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer which was launched in the first quarter of 2008 in addition we continue to place vettest ® instruments through sales lease rental and other programs with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales the two chemistry analyzers provide for an active installed base of approximately 31000 units a substantial portion of 2010 catalyst dx ® analyzer placements were to veterinary clinics that already own our vettest ® analyzer however an increasing number of placements were to competitive accounts in comparison to 2009 as we continue to experience growth in sales of catalyst dx ® analyzers and the related consumables we expect to see a decline in the sales of vettest ® consumables based on projections of future sales volume and the average unit price of consumables used in the catalyst dx ® and vettest ® analyzers we do not expect a future shift to catalyst dx ® consumables to significantly impact gross margin percentage we do however expect nearterm downward pressure on gross margin percentage in the instruments and consumables business due to higher relative instrument placement revenues as compared to consumables’ sales with continued penetration of the catalyst dx ® analyzer our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes utilization can increase either by an increased number of patient samples being run or by an increase in the quantity of instrument consumables used per patient sample our strategy is to increase both parameters 

the procyte dx ™ analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer which we launched in the third quarter of 2010 in addition we sell the lasercyte ® analyzer and vetautoread ™ analyzer a substantial portion of procyte dx ™ placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own a lasercyte ® analyzer and a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread ™ analyzer growth in sales of hematology consumables is attributable to an increase in the installed base of our lasercyte ® and procyte dx ™ analyzers 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products from those of other inclinic instrument manufacturers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on timetoresult easeofuse throughput breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ability to handle compromised samples analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® station education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price 

rapid assay products  our rapid assay line of business consists primarily of singleuse kits for pointofcare testing and to a limited degree microwellbased kits for laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests from those of other inclinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse and superior performance including by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes where alternative pointofcare offerings exist we seek to differentiate our tests with superior performance as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer service we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

we also seek to enhance the attractiveness of our tests by providing the snapshot dx ® analyzer which automatically reads certain snap ® test results and records those results in the electronic medical record we are currently working on enhancing the functionality of the snapshot dx ® analyzer to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of our competitors and inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of quality customer service technology employed and specialized test menu 

revenue growth in this line of business is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers including through reference laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions and the opening of new reference laboratories including laboratories that are colocated with large practice customers profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business 

  

  

 

practice information systems and digital radiography  our strategy in the practice information systems line of business is to provide superior integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives including superior client experience staff efficiency and practice profitability we differentiate our software systems through enhanced functionality and ease of use our veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in cag 

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support international sales of water testing products represented 49 of total water product sales in 2010 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

livestock and poultry diagnostics 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics with growth primarily coming from disease outbreaks emerging markets and our farm animal side test initiative a line of products and services designed specifically for livestock and poultry veterinarians and producers disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can fluctuate in 2010 approximately 88 of our sales in this business were international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

other 

dairy  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverage almost exclusively the snap ® platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection the majority of our sales in this business are international to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  

  

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use menu convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

opti medical systems also manufactures our vetstat ® analyzer an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the idexx vetlab ® suite for the veterinary market in addition opti medical systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the catalyst dx ® analyzer our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat ® and catalyst dx ® platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale 

other activities  we have developed certain proprietary technology that we believe may have application in areas that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories our strategy is to outlicense these technologies to partners that are best positioned to complete the development and commercialization of products utilizing these technologies to the extent we are successful in doing so we may receive onetime or recurring payments based on the achievement of development or sales milestones our ability to succeed in this area of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific personnel to develop proprietary products or technology and our ability to identify suitable third parties to complete the commercialization of these technologies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2010 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured see note 3i to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2010 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

multiple element arrangements “meas”  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers or digital radiography systems combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements “emas” consumables reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and practice management software practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide delivery of our idexx vetlab ® instruments digital radiography systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement emas consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting   services typically are delivered over future periods generally one to five years in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of future products and services 

  

  

 

when arrangements outside of the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element we establish the selling price of each element based on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements when arrangements outside of the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include a separatelypriced ema we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive if there is no stated contractual price for an ema or the separately stated price is not substantive we recognize revenue according to the mea policy stated above 

when arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value when vsoe exists for all elements or by using the residual method when there is vsoe for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered element all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered we generally determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services we apply judgment in determining whether discounts are significant and incremental when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement determination of whether a discount is significant is subjective if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered incremental 

customer programs  we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits award idexx points under customer reward programs or provide other incentives through the third quarter of 2010 our two most significant customer programs were practice developer ® and snap ® up the savings tm “suts” effective october 1 2010 we discontinued our practice developer ® program and launched our realtime care tm protocols and advanced lab protocols customer programs these customer programs are only offered to north american cag customers 

our practice developer ® program was a cag awards program that permitted customers to earn idexx points by purchasing quarterly minimums in certain product and service categories including idexx reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services catalyst dx ® and vettest ®   slides snap ® reader reagents lasercyte ® and vetautoread tm tubes and service and maintenance agreements prior to 2010 customers could also earn idexx points under the practice developer ® program based on purchases of snap ® tests snap ® tests were removed from this program at the end of 2009 resulting in no idexx points awarded under this program for snap ® tests purchased in 2010 

  

  

suts is our volume incentive program for selected snap ® tests that provides customers with benefits in the form of 1 discounts off invoice at the time of purchase and 2 award points based on total purchase volume of qualified snap ® products during the quarter in 2009 coinciding with the removal of snap ® products from the practice developer ® program the suts program was redesigned to provide customers the opportunity to earn higher award payouts and to allow for the payout of award points earned quarterly throughout the suts program year which ends on september 30 the 2009 modifications to the suts program resulted in increased customer earning of award points in 2010 as compared to prior years 

the realtime care tm protocols and advanced lab protocols customer programs permit idexx customers to earn award points by running or ordering certain qualifying tests revenue reductions recognized in 2010 related to these two programs were not material as these two programs had only been in place for the last three months of 2010 

estimated revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on the actual issuance of credits award points earned but not yet issued and estimates of credits and award points to be earned in the future based on applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the quarter in our analysis we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from customers which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic “practicelevel sales data” and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by our customers via idexx smartservice tm connectivity 

in addition we sometimes offer incentives to customers that enter into agreements with us to purchase products or services in future periods incentives may be in the form of cash or idexx points and are granted to the customer at the inception of the agreement these types of incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the customer agreement 

future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

idexx points may be applied against the purchase price for idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us the most significant estimate related to idexx point programs is estimating the amount of points expected to expire or breakage as idexx points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of breakage using historical forfeiture rates on november 30 of each year unused points earned before january 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate this variance was not material for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

following is a summary of revenue reductions recorded in connection with our customer programs for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008  in thousands  

 

  

 

  

  

 

at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the total accrued revenue reductions were 222 million 174 million and 152 million respectively following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to idexx points customer programs and incentive offerings and the ending accrued revenue reductions balance for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008  in thousands  

 

  

 

inventory valuation 

we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a market value is not readily available the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets including intangible assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist for impairment testing the fair values of the reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using an income approach by developing forecasts of discounted future cash flows model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however at december 31 2010 a 25 decrease in the current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge for any of our reporting units that include goodwill as a measure to assess the fair values of the reporting units we aggregate the fair value of each of the reporting units and compare that aggregate total to the overall market capitalization of the company as of november 30 2010 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair values of the reporting units approximated the company’s market capitalization no goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the annual or eventdriven reviews during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 or 2008 

  

  

during 2008 we sold certain pharmaceutical product lines and pharmaceutical assets that qualified as a business the pharmaceutical business had 137 million of related goodwill of which 72 million was allocated to the product lines sold based on their respective fair values and written off in connection with the sale fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach a substantial portion of the remaining goodwill is associated with products that have been licensed to third parties and is included in our “other” segment realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the assets the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 

no impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2010 during 2009 we recognized an impairment charge of 15 million to write off an acquired intangible asset associated with our equine digital radiography business which is part of our cag segment based on changes in estimated future demand and market conditions we determined that we would not fully realize our investment and therefore fully expensed this asset no other impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2009 no impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2008 

sharebased compensation 

our sharebased compensation programs include grants of a mix of restricted stock units and stock options along with employee stock purchase rights and deferred stock units with vesting conditions 

on january 1 2006 we adopted amendments to the accounting provisions governing sharebased payments and adopted the straightline method to prospectively expense sharebased awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 the gradedvesting or accelerated method was used to calculate the expense for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 had the straightline method been used for sharebased awards granted prior to january 1 2006 recorded expense for the years ended december 31 2006 through 2010 would have been higher the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we may use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates however substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

 

  

 

changes in the subjective input assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of an option the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2010 72 million would have increased or decreased by approximately 8 if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumptions was increased or decreased by 10 to 341 or 279 respectively the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2010 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by approximately 01 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption used to value options granted during 2010 was increased or decreased by 10 to 341 or 279 respectively 

  

  

 

to develop the expected term assumption for option awards we previously elected to use the simplified method which was based on vesting and contractual terms beginning in january 2008 we derived the expected term assumption for options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the expected term for future awards is determined using a consistent method longer expected term assumptions increase the fair value of option awards and therefore increase the expense recognized per award the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2010 72 million would have increased by 10 or decreased by 12 if the weighted average of the expected term assumptions were increased or decreased by one year respectively the total expense recognized for the year ended december 31 2010 for options awarded during 2010 would have increased or decreased by 02 million if the weighted average of the expected term assumptions were increased or decreased by one year respectively 

sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results total sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 131 million which is net of a reduction of 30 million for actual and estimated forfeitures changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment by certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and therefore on sharebased compensation expense modifications of the terms of outstanding options may result in significant increases or decreases in sharebased compensation there were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units with vesting conditions during 2010 2009 or 2008 

the fair value of options restricted stock units deferred stock units with vesting conditions and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 totaled 160 million 160 million and 187 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2010 was 271 million net of approximately 88 million related to actual and estimated forfeitures the weighted average remaining expense recognition period is approximately 16 years 

income taxes 

we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards net of valuation allowances was 86 million and 80 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively on a quarterly basis we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2010 would not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in one subsidiary where a 5 reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of 04 million for this subsidiary 

for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  

  

 

our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by 03 million this increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 2325 million at december 31 2010 no provision has been made for us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accrued taxes on a current basis 

we record a liability for uncertain tax positions in accordance with a comprehensive model for the recognition measurement and financial statement disclosure this comprehensive model requires us to assess all tax positions against a more likely than not standard we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 55 million and 60 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 

results of operations and trends 

effects of certain factors on results of operations 

distributor purchasing and inventories  the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment are sold in the us and certain other geographies by third party distributors who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices which are the end users as a result distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying enduser demand for our products consequently reported results may reflect fluctuations in distributors’ inventories and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to this as the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the current year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

  

  

at the end of a quarter we believe that our us cag distributors typically hold inventory equivalent to approximately four weeks of our anticipated enduser demand for instrument consumables and rapid assay products 

currency impact  for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 25 24 and 24 respectively of idexx sales were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the us dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally and a weakening of the us dollar has the opposite effect similarly to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offset this exposure 

the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is a nonus gaap measure that is calculated by applying the difference between the average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2009 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total company revenue by approximately 29 million due primarily to the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar australian dollar and to a lesser extent the japanese yen these favorable impacts were partly offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro between these two periods although the changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a net favorable impact on total company revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 our lpd segment was negatively impacted since the us dollar strengthened against the euro and compared to our other segments a larger portion of lpd sales are denominated in the euro 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2009 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2008 changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced total company revenue by approximately 240 million due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro and to a lesser extent the canadian dollar these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen these changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted the revenues generated by each of our individual operating segments in a manner similar to the impact on the company as a whole 

economic conditions  demand for many of our products and services has been negatively affected by poor economic conditions that have existed over the past two years in our cag segment we believe that negative consumer sentiment resulting from economic conditions has led to fewer patient visits to veterinary clinics which we continued to observe for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 relative to the same period in 2009 we believe the reduced patient visits have negatively affected the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests instrument consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in addition we believe the rate of growth of sales of our instruments and digital radiography systems which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians has been negatively affected by continued caution among veterinarians regarding economic conditions weaker economic conditions have also caused our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower growth due to limited price increases for certain products 

we also believe that current economic conditions have affected purchasing decisions by certain customer groups in our water and lpd businesses lower water testing volumes in the regulated and nonregulated segments of our water business have resulted from a decline in municipal water studies and new home construction respectively lower lpd testing volumes have resulted from a reduction in nonregulated testing performed by producers and laboratories as a measure to reduce operating costs and from a reduction in testing associated with some government mandated eradication programs as a result of lower government funding 

we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets will partially mitigate the effects of continuing slow economic growth and negative consumer sentiment however until we see improvements in broad factors that measure the economic climate both in the united states and europe we expect our growth rates will continue to be negatively affected

instruments revenue was 855 million and 773 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively consumables revenue was 2280 million and 2185 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively instrument service and accessories revenue was 397 million and 357 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the remaining sources of revenue are not significant to overall instruments and consumables revenue the 82 million increase in instruments revenue was due primarily to sales of our procyte dx tm instrument our new hematology analyzer that we began shipping during the third quarter of 2010 and increased sales of our catalyst dx ® instrument and idexx vetlab station ®  this increase in instrument revenue was partly offset by lower average unit sales prices and lower sales volumes of our lasercyte ® instrument due primarily to a shift in focus of our sales efforts to procyte dx tm  the 95 million increase in consumables revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of consumables used with our catalyst dx ® instrument partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest ® instrument as catalyst dx ® instruments continue to replace vettest ® instruments at certain customers the 40 million increase in instrument service and accessories revenue was primarily a result of the growth of our active installed base of instruments the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels was not significant to reported instruments and consumables revenue 

the slight decrease in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to lower average unit sales prices of our snap ® tests resulting from competitive pressures and increased price sensitivity in certain segments of our customer base as a result of economic conditions and to a lesser extent lower us practicelevel sales primarily attributable to economic conditions these decreases were partly offset by higher sales volumes outside of the us and the favorable impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels which increased reported rapid assay revenue growth by 1 

the increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volume and to a lesser extent price increases higher testing volume was driven largely by the acquisition of new customers 

the increase in practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal digital radiography systems as this market is transitioning from older filmbased systems to digital as the standard of care an increase in service and support revenue related to both digital radiography systems and practice information management systems also contributed to revenue growth these increases were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for our digital radiography systems resulting from competitive conditions 

  

  

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher colilert ® product sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices the lower average unit sales prices resulted primarily from higher relative sales of colilert ® products in geographies where those products are sold at lower average unit sales prices 

livestock and poultry diagnostics the increase in lpd revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of certain bovine tests and to a lesser extent higher sales volumes of certain swine tests the increased sales volume of certain bovine tests was driven primarily by increased sales in germany where we have won several government tenders for testing in connection with a countrywide eradication program for a virus impacting beef and dairy production yields these increases were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to competitive conditions 

other the increase in other revenue was attributable primarily to higher sales volumes of our dairy snap ® residue test for the detection of melamine and higher sales volume of consumables used with our opti medical systems instruments these increases were partly offset by lower sales volumes of our dairy snap ® beta lactam test used for the detection of antibiotic residue in milk 

gross profit 

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 51 from 49 the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to improvements in the cost to manufacture and service our idexx vetlab ® instruments and increased volume leverage and other efficiency gains in our reference laboratory diagnostics and consulting services business lower depreciation on instruments placed at customer sites under usage agreements also contributed to the increase in gross profit percentage as we have reduced this type of placement activity and an increasing number of prior placements have become fully depreciated and ownership has transferred to the customer these favorable impacts were partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was due primarily to lower hedging gains during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 in comparison to the same period of the prior year and the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar australian dollar and japanese yen  

water gross profit for water increased slightly as higher sales were partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62 from 65 the decrease in the gross profit percentage for water was due primarily to the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher overall manufacturing costs the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was due to lower hedging gains during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 in comparison to the same period of the prior year and the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar and the canadian dollar these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of higher margin products 

  

  

livestock and poultry diagnostics gross profit for lpd increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 68 from 66 the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher relative sales of higher margin products and lower overall manufacturing costs these increases were partly offset by lower overall average unit sales prices increased royalty costs and the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and lower hedging gains during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 in comparison to the same period of the prior year  

other gross profit for other increased due to higher sales volume and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 46 from 45 the increase in gross profit percentage was due to lower costs of service in our opti medical and dairy businesses lower relative sales of lower margin dairy instruments and reduced overall manufacturing costs in our opti medical business these increases were partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnelrelated costs including an investment in field sales technical support personnel the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased legal and other fees incurred in connection with our response to the ftc subpoena discussed in more detail under the heading “part i item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k increased personnelrelated costs an increase in costs attributable to information technology investments the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in bad debt expense in connection with the bankruptcy of one of our us distributors professional veterinary products inc “pvp” these increases were partly offset by the absence of an impairment charge of 15 million that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 to write off an acquired intangible asset associated with our equine digital radiography business the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased personnelrelated costs 

  

  

water the following table presents water expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnelrelated costs the increase in general and administrative expense resulted from an increase in costs attributable to information technology investments and increased personnelrelated costs the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to decreased spending related to qualifying additional suppliers of certain raw materials and a reduction in personnelrelated costs 

livestock and poultry diagnostics the following table presents lpd operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from an increase in personnelrelated costs the decrease in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from decreased personnelrelated costs and lower amortization on our existing intangible assets these decreases were partly offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in costs attributable to information technology investments the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to an increase in personnelrelated costs 

other operating expenses for other increased 01 million to 137 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was due primarily to higher personnelrelated costs in our dairy business attributable in part to the development of business in china partly offset by an incremental milestone payment earned in 2010 related to the sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product lines milestone payments in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 totaling 30 million were earned due to the achievement of certain sales milestones by the third party that purchased the product rights in the fourth quarter of 2009 we earned a milestone payment of 20 million from the same third party as the result of the achievement of certain development milestones for this product because we have no obligation to deliver product or services or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement and because collectability is reasonably assured these milestone payments and any other related milestone payments we earn in the future are included in results of operations when earned but are not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business we may receive up to 65 million of future payments based on the achievement of future sales milestones by this third party 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased 20 million to 108 million for the year ended december 31 2010 due to the absence of an impairment charge in 2010 in comparison to 2009 and lower research and development personnelrelated costs the impairment charge recorded in 2009 was to write off software to manage the various aspects of product development and product lifecycles these decreases were partly offset by the writeoff in 2010 of certain design costs related to a facilities project that has changed in scope 

  

  

 

interest income and interest expense 

  

interest income was 07 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 05 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 24 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 19 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher effective interest rates and to a lesser extent higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured shortterm revolving credit facility “credit facility” with the commencement of our interest rate swap agreements on march 31 2010 we effectively fixed our interest rate at 2 plus 0375 to 0875 percentage points “credit spread” on 80 million of funds borrowed under the credit facility through march 31 2012 as the fixed rate under the interest rate swap agreements is higher than the weighted average interest rate of debt outstanding during 2009 interest expense was higher for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period of the prior year 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 301 for the year ended december 31 2010 and 300 for the year ended december 31 2009 the slight increase in the tax rate is due primarily to an increase in earnings taxed at domestic rates that are higher than international rates partly offset by tax benefits related to us manufacturing activities that were fully phased in effective january 1 2010 

in 2011 it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to 11 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2010 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various us and international tax jurisdictions

the increase in practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal digital radiography systems and peripheral equipment and support services related to our practice information management systems these favorable items were partly offset by lower sales of equine digital radiography systems lower average unit prices for companion animal digital radiography systems and lower sales of cornerstone ® practice information management systems 

the decrease in pharmaceutical products revenue was due primarily to the pharmaceutical transaction in the fourth quarter of 2008 in which we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines as a result we did not have significant pharmaceutical product revenue in 2009 

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher average unit sales prices partly offset by lower sales volume of certain water products higher average unit sales prices were attributable to a favorable mix of product sales within certain markets the impact of price increases for certain products sold in the us and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at higher average unit sales prices 

livestock and poultry diagnostics the decrease in lpd revenue resulted primarily from the impact of the timing of revenue recognition on shipments to a customer where revenue for shipments to that customer is recognized on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectability and lower average unit sales prices these unfavorable items were partly offset by higher overall sales volumes 

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of dairy and opti medical products higher dairy volume was primarily attributable to snap ® antibiotic residue tests a snap ® residue test for the detection of melamine that we launched in the second quarter of 2009 and an instrument that we launched in 2008 these favorable items were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for opti medical products 

gross profit

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 06 million to 128 million for the year ended december 31 2009 due to the writeoff of capitalized costs related to an information technology project and higher expense related to sharebased compensation the impairment charge recorded in 2009 was to write off software to manage the various aspects of product development and product lifecycles these increases were partly offset by the impact of the fourth quarter 2008 sale of our acarexx ® and surpass ® pharmaceutical products and a product that was under development and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical division in 2008 we recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately 15 million of which 11 million was recorded in general and administrative expense 03 million was recorded in sales and marketing expense and 01 million was recorded in research and development expense 

 

interest income and interest expense 

 

interest income was 05 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 23 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in interest income was due to lower effective interest rates partly offset by higher average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 19 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 46 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in interest expense was due to lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt balances partly offset by lower capitalized interest and higher average borrowings under our credit facility 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 300 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 317 for the year ended december 31 2008  the decrease in tax rate was due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations settlement of an audit in an international tax jurisdiction and the writeoff of nondeductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 these benefits were partly offset by a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 due to a change in the statutory tax rates for a jurisdiction in which we operate this benefit of approximately 15 million reduced our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 by 09 percentage points

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 1788 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 1750 million for the same period in 2009 the total net income and net noncash charges excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units to a financing activity was 2001 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 1904 million for the same period in 2009 resulting in incremental operating cash flows of 97 million this was attributable to a 191 million increase in net income partly offset by a decrease in net noncash charges primarily a 42 million decrease in deferred taxes and a 38 million decrease in depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation was primarily due to lower depreciation from instruments placed at customer sites under usage agreements the total of the changes in operating assets and liabilities and reclassifications of the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units decreased cash by 213 million and 155 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively resulting in an incremental decrease in cash of 58 million 

 

  

  

 

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the same period of the prior year the increase in accrued liabilities resulted primarily from increased tax accruals as result of higher pretax income and lower accelerated tax depreciation deductions as compared to the same period of the prior year the timing of inventory receipts most significantly of slides used with our chemistry analyzers and of hematology instruments and consumables contributed to a decrease in cash flow  which was partly offset by associated increases in cash flow from the timing of payments for inventory  inventory receipts during the year ended december 31 2010 included the procyte dx ™ analyzer and related consumables which we launched in the third quarter of 2010 

we historically have experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher or net positive cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period several factors contribute to the seasonal fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities including the following 

 

 

 

 

investing activities cash used by investing activities was 432 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to cash used of 536 million for the same period of 2009 the decrease in cash used for the year ended december 31 2010 in comparison to the same period of the prior year is due primarily to less cash used for the renovation of our headquarters facilities and information technology projects during the year ended december 31 2010 we used approximately 69 million and 110 million for the renovation of our headquarters facility and investments in information technology projects respectively compared to 133 million and 138 million during the same period of the prior year this decrease was partly offset by additional investments in manufacturing equipment a 4 million investment in a company that owns and operates veterinary hospitals primarily in the eastern united states see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and lower proceeds received in connection with the disposition of assets during the year ended december 31 2010 during the year ended december 31 2009 we received net proceeds of 55 million from the sale of our pharmaceutical product lines and from the sale of property and equipment 

our total capital expenditure plan for 2011 is approximately 45 million which includes approximately 105 million for the renovation and expansion on our headquarters facility 

  

  

 

financing activities cash used by financing activities was 868 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to cash used of 953 million for the same period in 2009 the decrease in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to an increase in net borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2010 we had 1290 million outstanding under the credit facility of which 20 million was borrowed by our canadian subsidiary and denominated in canadian dollars the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by 10 million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers’ compensation policy covering claims for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 the credit facility contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants as well as customary events of default which provide for the acceleration of amounts outstanding under the credit facility or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder in the event of noncompliance one of our financial covenants requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the credit facility not to exceed 3to1 at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 

the decrease in cash used by financing activities was also attributable to the 125 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans and the related 129 million increase in tax benefits from the exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we received 289 million and 164 million respectively on the exercise of stock options and purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan due primarily to an increase in the number of options exercised and to a lesser extent an increase in the weighted average exercise price exercise activity increased during 2010 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the adoption by our chief executive officer of a securities trading plan designed to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as a result of the increase in exercise activity and of the stock performance the tax benefit from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units increased 129 million to 181 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 52 million for the same period of the prior year 

the decrease in cash used by financing activities was partly offset by the incremental 60 million used to repurchase treasury stock during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 44 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions from the inception of the program in august 1999 to december 31 2010 we repurchased 402 million shares during the year ended december 31 2010 we purchased 25 million shares for an aggregate cost of 1431 million compared to purchases of 19 million shares for an aggregate cost of 831 million during the year ended december 31 2009 we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see item 5 and note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for us employees since january 1 2003 we have retained the first 250000 in claim liability per incident and an aggregate claim liability based on multiple elements including payroll for each year the insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims based on this analysis we have recognized expenses of 09 million 05 million and 08 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 are relatively undeveloped and significant additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims our liability for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 could exceed our estimates and we could be liable for up to 18 million and 14 million respectively in excess of the expense we have recognized for the six years ended on or prior to december 31 2008 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability our maximum liability at december 31 2010 is 08 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized in connection with these policies we have outstanding letters of credit totaling 18 million that have been issued in favor of our insurance providers as security for these claims 

 

  

  

we have commitments outstanding for additional purchase price payments of up to 76 million in connection with the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets that occurred prior to the january 1 2009 revisions to the accounting principles and requirements for business combinations all of these commitments are contingent upon the achievement by certain acquired businesses of specified milestones of the total outstanding commitments of 76 million 01 million has been accrued for at december 31 2010 

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below 

 

 

 

 

these commitments do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 50 million and deferred compensation liabilities of 22 million as of december 31 2010 as the timing of recognition is uncertain refer to note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2010 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend 

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 25 24 and 24 respectively of idexx sales were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into forward exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions market gains and losses are deferred in other current or longterm assets or accruals as appropriate until the contract matures which is the period when the related obligation is settled we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions 

we identify foreign currency exchange risk by regularly monitoring our transactions denominated in foreign currencies we attempt to mitigate currency risk by hedging the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure currency exposure on large purchases of foreign currency denominated products are evaluated in our hedging program and used as natural hedges to offset identified hedge requirements related to intercompany sales 

 

  

  

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2010 we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other specific significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year that are in excess of amounts previously hedged accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany sales outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 1332 million and 1169 million respectively at december 31 2010 we had 15 million in net unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 07 million in taxes 

our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components 1 local currency revenues and expenses 2 the impact of settled hedge contracts and 3 intercompany and trade balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is different from the functional currency used by each subsidiary based on projected revenues and expenses for 2011 excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies a 10 strengthening of the usd would reduce operating income by approximately 8 million the impact of the intercompany and trade balances referred to in the third component above has been excluded as they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have 

we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of our credit facility to the extent that the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” increases borrowings under our credit facility bear interest in the range from 0375 to 0875 percentage points “credit spread” above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2010 were 1290 million at a weightedaverage interest rate of 19 based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2010 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 05 million on an annualized basis 

in march 2009 we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of 80 million to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our credit facility under these agreements beginning on march 31 2010 we effectively fixed our interest exposure on 80 million of our outstanding borrowings through march 30 2012 by converting our variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments at 2 plus the credit spread the critical terms of the fixed interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the underlying borrowings including notional amounts underlying market indices interest rate reset dates and maturity dates accordingly we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities

other activities 

in connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical product line at the end of 2008 we realigned two of our remaining product lines to the rapid assay line of business which is part of our cag segment and realigned the remainder of the products which comprises one product line and two outlicensing arrangements from the pharmaceutical division to the other category the financial impacts of the product line and outlicensing arrangements have been shown in the other category for 2009 and 2008 the segment information for the year ended december 31 2007 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

when a research and development program materializes into a product or service offering that does not align with one of our existing product or service categories the related financial impacts are shown in the other category 

unallocated amounts 

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing product or service categories a portion of sharebased compensation expense interest income and expense and income taxes we estimate our sharebased compensation expense for the year and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company resulting in an unallocated amount reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

we maintain active research and development programs some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new technology products or services research and development costs incurred that are not specifically allocated to one of our existing product or service categories are reported under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

marketing and distribution 

we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in australia canada china france germany italy japan the netherlands spain switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom sales and marketing expense was 1677 million 1700 million and 1519 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively or 163 of sales in 2009 166 of sales in 2008 and 165 of sales in 2007 

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our veterinary laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide through our direct sales force we market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force and through distributors primarily in the us we market our water production animal and dairy products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force we sell our opti ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti ® products primarily through distributors and other resellers 

our largest customers are our us distributors of our products in the cag segment one of our cag distributors butler animal health supply llc “butler” accounted for 7 of our 2009 revenue and 8 of our 2008 and 2007 revenue butler accounted for 4 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2009 and 5 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2008 and 2007 in december 2009 butler combined with the us animal health business of henry schein inc “schein” to form butler schein animal health schein accounted for 3 of our 2009 2008 and 2007 revenue and 2 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007

research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and consulting costs were 651 million 707 million and 673 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively or 63 of sales in 2009 69 of sales in 2008 and 73 of sales in 2007 

patents and licenses 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties 

important patents and licenses include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products in some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers 

significant products supplied by third parties include vettest ® analyzers and consumables catalyst dx ® consumables other than electrolyte consumables and vetautoread ™  vetlyte ® and coag dx ™ analyzers and consumables 

vettest ® slides and catalyst dx ® chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that expire in 2025 we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® slides and catalyst dx ® chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements 

other analyzers and consumables are purchased under supply agreements with terms ranging from 1 year to 14 years which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements or require us to compensate the supplier see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  9 

we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from a single supplier these products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay and dairy devices production animal testing kits water testing products and blood analyzers including our lasercyte ® analyzers 

we have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services this competition is intensifying as some of our competitors have expanded the range of products and services offered to the companion animal veterinary market and expanded the geographic scope of their operations in addition we expect that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary or highly differentiated products integrate our products develop and maintain effective sales channels attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from large human medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health several large human diagnostic companies are indirect competitors in that they have partnered with veterinaryfocused companies to provide their products and technologies to our markets our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both laboratory service and inclinic product providers our competitors vary in our different markets in some markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures several of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

 

 

 

 

  10 

 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing marketing and promotion recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our production animal products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the fdc act 

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity “ce” marking for their products 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ®  quantitray ®  filtamax ®  enterolert ®  and simplate ® for heterotropic plate counts products have been approved by the epa the sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world 

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs are regulated by the fda before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fda approved protocol administered by aoac research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap ® betalactam dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the fda ncims and aoac ri while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti ® instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti ® products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti ® products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k application 

  11 

opti ® products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food medical device and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

at december 31 2009 we had approximately 4800 fulltime and parttime employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the companion animal health care industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increased competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our historical growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability 

we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our vetautoread ™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte idexx vetlab ® ua ™ urinalysis vettest ® chemistry and coag dx ™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products dairy testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers to mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we generally enter into longterm contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices however there can be no assurance that suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply products under our contracts or that suppliers will always fulfill their obligations 

  12 

under these contracts in addition under some of these agreements we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements or require us to compensate the supplier also in some cases we purchase sole and single source products or components under shortterm contracts or purchase orders in these cases we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply and to the risk that a supplier will not fulfill our requirements for products if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future we may be unable to supply the market which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market 

many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to diagnostic testing economic weakness in our significant markets has caused and could continue to cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to treat certain pet health conditions approve certain diagnostic tests or continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments a decline in pet visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services 

disruption in financial and currency markets could have a negative effect on our business 

over the past 18 months financial markets in the us europe australia and asia have experienced extreme disruption including among other things volatility in exchange rates and security prices diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the current tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for our products and services the inability of pet owners to obtain consumer credit could lead to a decline in pet visits to the veterinarian which could result in a decrease in diagnostic testing likewise a decrease in diagnostic testing could negatively impact the financial condition of the veterinary practices that are our customers which may inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in addition although current economic conditions have not impacted our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations further deterioration in financial markets could adversely affect our access to capital we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the japanese yen and the australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the margins on products manufactured in the us and exported to international markets for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 24 of idexx sales were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies 

  13 

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda and the epa most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our opti ® line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and these products require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

in january 2010 we received a letter from the us federal trade commission “ftc” stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether idexx or others have engaged in or are engaging in unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act “ftc act” through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary products and services including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with distributors or endusers of those products or services the letter requests that we preserve all materials potentially relevant to this investigation the letter states that the ftc has not concluded that idexx or anyone else has violated section 5 of the ftc act 

we anticipate that we will receive a subpoena from the ftc requesting that we provide the ftc with documents and information relevant to this investigation and we intend to cooperate fully with the ftc in its investigation we cannot predict how long any investigation might be ongoing 

we believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and services do not violate section 5 of the ftc act or any other antitrust law however it is possible that the ftc could reach a different conclusion at the end of its investigation and elect to commence an enforcement action in an administrative law court within the ftc if the ftc were to commence an enforcement action we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously were the ftc to prevail in the action and through all subsequent appeals we believe that any remedies likely to be sought by the ftc under section 5 would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights in june 2009 one of the us patents covering our snap ® fivfelv tests expired we had licensed this broad patent exclusively from the university of california expiration of this patent could result in increased competition in the us market for feline immunodeficiency virus tests and if so we would expect that revenues and profit margins associated snap ® fivfelv tests including combo and triple will likely decline 

  14 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations 

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph see “part 1 item 1 business – marketing and distribution” 

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition will become even more intense the introduction by competitors of new and competitive products and services could result in a decline in sales andor profitability of our products and services in addition competitors may develop products or services that are superior to our products and services which could cause us to lose existing customers and market share some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

the market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our production animal products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our production animal dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bse in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which has been estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 as a result we believe that we are likely to lose a portion of our sales of postmortem tests for bse 

consolidation of veterinary hospitals could negatively affect our business 

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield the pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech our primary competitor in the us and canadian markets for veterinary laboratory diagnostic services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their laboratory services almost exclusively and shift a large portion of their testing from inclinic testing to their reference laboratories in addition because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services marketplace hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

  15 

our inexperience in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

upon acquiring the critical care division of osmetech plc in january 2007 we entered the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the opti ® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our inexperience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2009 40 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar inability of our customers to obtain us dollars to pay our invoices disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and licensing requirements and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period in addition many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured sourced or both in the us and our costs are incurred in us dollars we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure however an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins additionally a strengthening us dollar could negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars 

our operations are vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural disasters or system failures 

the operation of all of our facilities is vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and manmade disasters interruptions in power supply or other system failures while we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events 

we manufacture many of our significant products including our rapid assay devices certain instruments and most water dairy and production animal testing products at a single facility in westbrook maine therefore interruption of operations at this facility would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature however this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur in addition such insurance will not compensate us for the longterm competitive effects of being off the market for the period of any interruption in operations 

  16 

the loss of our president chief executive officer and chairman could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w ayers our president chief executive officer and chairman we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr ayers the loss of mr ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

description of segments  during 2009 we operated primarily through three business segments diagnostic and information technology products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for production animal health which we refer to as the production animal segment “pas” we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality “dairy” and products for the human pointofcare medical diagnostic market “opti medical” financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments and other licensing arrangements are combined and presented in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories a portion of sharebased compensation expense interest income and expense and income taxes in our segment disclosure of gross profit operating expenses and operating income these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts” we estimate our sharebased compensation expense for the year and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company resulting in an unallocated amount reported under the unallocated category 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services give us scale in sales and distribution permit us to offer integrated diseasemanagement diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing and facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems with reference laboratory test data inclinic test data from our idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers and radiographic data from the idexxpacs ™ and idexx equiview pacs ™ software generated by our digital radiography systems 

instruments and consumables  our strategy in our idexx vetlab ® instrument line of business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments the principal instruments used by veterinarians for inclinic diagnostic testing are chemistry and hematology analyzers in addition we sell instruments used for endocrinology blood gas electrolytes urinalysis and blood coagulation testing our idexx vetlab ® station is an inclinic laboratory information management system that records and integrates patient diagnostic information from our analyzers for better practice management for customers that utilize our ivls we offer idexx smartservice ™ solutions an electronic customer support and service tool that allows idexx technical support to remotely monitor instrument performance troubleshoot issues and provide system updates additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables and therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross margins in this line of business 

  26 

our catalyst dx ® analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer which was launched in the first quarter of 2008 in addition we sell and have an active installed base of approximately 31000 vettest ® analyzers with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales we continue to place vettest ® instruments through sales lease rental and other programs a substantial portion of 2009 catalyst dx ® analyzer placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vettest ® analyzer as we continue to experience growth in sales of catalyst dx ® analyzers and the related consumables we expect to see a decline in the sales of vettest ® consumables based on projections of future sales volume and the average unit price of consumables used in the catalyst dx ® and vettest ® analyzers we do not expect a future shift to catalyst dx ® consumables to significantly impact gross margin we do however expect nearterm downward pressure on gross margin percentage due to higher relative instrument placement revenues as compared to consumables’ sales with continued penetration of the catalyst dx ® analyzer our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

we purchase the chemistry consumables other than electrolyte slides used in our catalyst dx ® and vettest ® analyzers from orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” under a supply agreement that continues through 2025 this supply agreement provides us with a longterm source of slides at costs that improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing purchase volumes 

our principal hematology analyzer is the lasercyte ® analyzer in addition we sell the vetautoread ™ analyzer a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread ™ analyzer although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables lasercyte ® consumable sales have been partly offset by declines in sales of vetautoread ™ consumables 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products from those of other inclinic instrument manufacturers and laboratory diagnostic service providers based on breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability easeofuse throughput ability to handle compromised samples timetoresult analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® station education and training and superior sales and customer service our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies premium pricing 

rapid assay products  our rapid assay line of business consists primarily of singleuse kits for pointofcare testing and to a limited degree microwellbased kits for laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests from those of other inclinic test providers and laboratory diagnostic service providers through easeofuse and superior performance including by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes where alternative pointofcare offerings exist we seek to differentiate our tests with superior performance as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer service we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing we also seek to enhance efficiency and test result capture by providing our customers with the ability to have rapid assay tests read and results recorded into the patient record by our snapshot dx ® analyzer this functionality is currently available for use with our snap ® tests for evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function diagnosing canine pancreatitis feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus and for screening for heartworm and three additional tickborne diseases ehrlichiosis lyme and anaplasmosis we are currently developing this functionality across our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

  27 

veterinary laboratory diagnostic and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors and inclinic offerings primarily on the basis of quality customer service technology employed and specialized test menu revenue growth in this line of business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers including through laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions and the opening of new laboratories in 2009 we acquired a telemedicine and consulting services business located in the us in 2008 we acquired a laboratory in spain and acquired certain intellectual property and distribution rights associated with a diagnostic test product in 2007 we acquired laboratories in the us and canada and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us switzerland and the united kingdom profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business 

practice information systems and digital radiography  these lines of business consist of veterinary practice information systems including hardware and software and veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems our strategy in the practice information systems line of business is to provide superior software and hardware integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives we differentiate our software systems through enhanced functionality and ease of use our veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals the digital radiography systems also incorporate idexxpacs ™ and idexx equiview pacs ™ picture archiving and communication software developed by idexx that allows for image enhancement manipulation storage and retrieval and integration with the practice information software our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the companion animal group 

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support international sales of water testing products represented 47 of total water product sales in 2009 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

production animal segment 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can fluctuate in 2009 approximately 88 of our sales in this business were international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

  28 

other 

dairy  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverage almost exclusively the snap ® platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection the majority of our sales in this business are international to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and producer segments of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use menu convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

opti medical systems also supplies our vetstat ® analyzer an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the idexx vetlab ® suite for the veterinary market in addition opti medical systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the catalyst dx ® analyzer our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat ® and catalyst dx ® platforms for veterinary applications 

other activities  we have developed certain proprietary technology that we believe may have application in areas that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories our strategy is to outlicense these technologies to partners that are best positioned to complete the development and commercialization of products utilizing these technologies to the extent we are successful in doing so we may receive onetime or recurring payments based on the achievement of development or sales milestones our ability to succeed in this area of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific personnel to develop proprietary products or technology and our ability to identify suitable third parties to complete the commercialization of these technologies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2009 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured see note 3h to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue 

  29 

multiple element arrangements mea’s  arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables our most significant mea’s include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers or digital radiography systems combined with one or more of the following products extended maintenance agreements consumables laboratory services and practice management software practice management software is frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide interpretation of customer sales agreements is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a mea should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 

when arrangements include multiple elements we use verifiable objective evidence “voe” of fair value or vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element the timing of product and service revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether fair value exists for those elements changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

we determine voe and vsoe of fair value by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements we have determined that the software components of our digital radiography systems and ivls are more than incidental to the products as a whole therefore we account for sales of these products in mea’s under software accounting guidance and defer revenue equal to the fair value of the support provided to the customer during the oneyear warranty period judgment is required to determine whether the software within our digital systems and ivls is essential to the functionality of the products and judgment and estimation is required to establish the fair value of the updates and support provided we have also applied judgment to determine that software used in or with our idexx vetlab ® instruments except for the ivls is not more than incidental to the functionality of those instruments 

certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future products and services we apply judgment in determining whether discounts are significant and incremental and when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental we do not account for the discount as an element of the arrangement if the future discount is significant and incremental we recognize that discount as an element of the arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative fair value to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental we look to the discount provided in standalone sales of the same product to similar customers the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement if the discount in the mea approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales that discount is not considered significant and incremental 

we separately price extended maintenance agreements “ema” sold to customers when an ema is sold as a component of a multiproduct sale we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straightline basis over the life of the agreement 

customer programs  we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits award points or provide other incentives future market conditions and changes in product offerings may require us to change marketing strategies to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods additionally certain incentive programs require us to estimate based on historical experience and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 

revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits points earned but not yet issued and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current revenue in our analysis we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected inhouse that details the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic “practicelevel sales data” 

  30 

customers can earn idexx points based on their participation in certain customer programs and making qualifying purchases related to those programs idexx points may then be applied against the purchase price for idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us as points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to expire or breakage using historical forfeiture rates on november 30 of each year unused points earned before january 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate our two most significant customer programs are practice developer ® and snap ® up the savings ™ “suts” both of which are offered only to north american customers in 2009 the suts program was redesigned to allow for payout of points earned quarterly the most significant estimate related to suts and other point programs is estimating the amount of breakage following is a summary of revenue reductions recorded under these programs and in total for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007  in thousands  

 

 

 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the total accrued revenue reductions were 174 million 152 million and 151 million respectively following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to idexx points customer programs and incentive offerings and the ending accrued revenue reductions balance for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007  in thousands

inventory valuation 

we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand market conditions remaining shelf life or product functionality if actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations certain major components of inventory for which we have made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below 

lasercyte ® hematology analyzer  at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 13 million 29 million and 27 million respectively of inventory associated with our lasercyte ® analyzer required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods which was net of 24 million 22 million and 17 million respectively of writedowns for inventory estimated to be obsolete and disposed we determined writedowns based on our estimate of the costs to rework inventory compared to replacement cost and the probability of success primarily based on historical experience we expect to fully realize our net investment in this inventory however if we are unsuccessful in reworking this inventory if we revise our judgment of our ability to successfully rework inventory due to new experience in reworking this inventory if we determine that it is more cost effective to purchase new inventory rather than rework this inventory or if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value if a market value is not readily available the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when material we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets including intangible assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist for impairment testing the fair values of the reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using an income approach by developing discounted cash flow models model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however at december 31 2009 a 25 decrease in the current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge for any of our reporting units that include goodwill as a measure to assess the fair values of the reporting units we aggregate the fair value of each of the reporting units and compare that aggregate total to the overall market capitalization of the company as of november 30 2009 the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment the total aggregate fair values of the reporting units was approximately 32 billion which approximates the company’s market capitalization as of that date no goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the annual or eventdriven reviews during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 or 2007 

during 2008 we sold certain pharmaceutical product lines and pharmaceutical assets that qualified as a business the pharmaceutical business had 137 million of related goodwill of which we wrote off approximately 72 million that was allocated to the product lines sold based on their respective fair values fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach a substantial portion of the remaining goodwill is associated with products that have been licensed to third parties and is included in our “other” segment realization of this goodwill is dependant upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the assets the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 

  32 

during 2009 we recognized an impairment charge of 15 million to write off an acquired intangible asset associated with our equine digital radiography business which is part of our cag segment based on changes in estimated future demand and market conditions we determined that we would not fully realize our investment and therefore fully expensed this asset no other impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2009 no impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2008 

during 2007 we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ® paste we also recognized a related inventory writedown the circumstances of which are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions we determined that we would not realize our investment in prepaid royalties and therefore fully expensed this asset no other impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2007 

sharebased compensation 

beginning in 2006 we modified our employee sharebased compensation programs to shift from the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of restricted stock units and stock options along with employee stock purchase rights there were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2009 2008 or 2007 

on january 1 2006 we adopted amendments to the accounting provisions governing sharebased payments and adopted the straightline method to prospectively expense sharebased awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 the gradedvesting or accelerated method has been used to calculate the expense for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 if the total fair value of sharebased compensation awards as well as other features that impact expense including forfeitures and capitalization of costs was consistent from yeartoyear in each of the last five years and through 2010 this change in expense method to straightline expensing would yield less than the pro forma gradedvesting expense through 2010 until awards granted prior to january 1 2006 were fully expensed however the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we may use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates however substantially all of our options granted during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were granted in the first quarter of each year the weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows 

 

 

 we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of an option the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2009 54 million would have increased by 9 or decreased by 7 if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumptions were increased or decreased by 10 to 336 or 275 respectively the total expense recognized for options awarded during the year ended december 31 2009 would have increased or decreased by 01 million if the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption used to value options granted during 2009 were increased or decreased by 10 to 336 or 275 respectively 

  33 

to develop the expected term assumption for option awards we previously elected to use the simplified method which is based on vesting and contractual terms beginning in january 2008 we derive the expected term assumption for options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the expected term for future awards will be determined using a consistent method longer expected term assumptions increase the fair value of option awards and therefore increase the expense recognized per award the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2009 54 million would have increased by 10 or decreased by 11 if the weighted average of the expected term assumptions were increased or decreased by one year respectively the total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended december 31 2009 would have increased or decreased by 01 million if the weighted average of the expected term assumptions were increased or decreased by one year respectively 

sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results sharebased compensation costs for the year ended december 31 2009 were 114 million which is net of a reduction of 25 million for actual and estimated forfeitures changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment by certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and therefore on sharebased compensation expense 

the fair value of options restricted stock units deferred stock units with vesting conditions and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 totaled 160 million 187 million and 182 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2009 before consideration of estimated forfeitures was 330 million we estimate that this cost will be reduced by approximately 34 million related to forfeitures the weighted average remaining expense recognition period is approximately 16 years 

income taxes 

we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards net of valuation allowances was 80 million and 75 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively on a quarterly basis we assess our current earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2009 would not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in two subsidiaries where a 5 reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of 12 million for those subsidiaries 

for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies alternatively in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

  34 

our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by 03 million this increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we consider the majority of the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 1940 million at december 31 2009 no provision has been made for us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accrued taxes on a current basis 

we record a liability for uncertain tax provisions in accordance with a comprehensive model for the recognition measurement and financial statement disclosure this comprehensive model requires us to assess all tax positions against a more likely than not standard we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs as of december 31 2009 our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 60 million which includes estimated interest expense and penalties 

results of operations 

impact of distribution channel on results of operations  because the instrument consumables and rapid assay products in our cag segment are sold in the us and certain other geographies by distributors distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices who are the end users distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying enduser demand for our products as a result fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

impact of economic factors including foreign currency exchange rates  approximately 24 of our revenue is derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our international revenues and on margins of products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in addition to the extent that the us dollar is stronger in future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods our growth rate will be negatively affected the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses foreign currency denominated supply contracts and the impact of foreign currency hedge contracts in place partly offset this exposure 

  35 

we believe that our financial results in 2009 continued to be negatively impacted by economic conditions that weakened over the course of 2008 due in large part to fewer patient visits to us and european veterinary clinics for routine screening preventive care and elective procedures we believe reduced patient visits negatively impacted the growth rate of sales of rapid assay tests instrument consumables and laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in our cag segment in addition we believe that the rate of growth of sales of our instruments which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians was negatively affected by increased caution among veterinarians regarding economic prospects weaker economic conditions also increased the sensitivity of our customers to the pricing of our products and services resulting in lower price realization for certain products over the course of 2009 relative to prior periods 

beyond our companion animal business we are also seeing the weaker economy impact certain customer groups in our water and pas businesses lower water testing volumes in the nonregulatory segments of the business have been driven by a decline in new home construction and reduced consumer willingness to spend on certain luxury items such as vacation cruises lower pas testing volumes have been driven by a reduction in nonregulatory producer and laboratory testing as a measure to reduce operating costs and by a reduction in testing associated with government mandated eradication programs due to lower government funding 

while we expect these trends to continue in the near term we believe the fundamental drivers of demand in the markets we serve to remain intact and that growth rates will improve as major world economies stabilize

  36 

companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

 

 

 the increase in instruments and consumables revenue was due to higher sales volumes partly offset by lower average unit sales prices on instruments higher sales volumes were driven primarily by sales of our catalyst dx ® analyzer which was launched at the end of the first quarter of 2008 this impact was partly offset by a decrease in sales of our other idexx vetlab ® instruments most notably of lasercyte ® analyzers due primarily to market penetration and a shift in focus of our sales efforts to our newer instruments higher sales volume was also attributable to sales of consumables used with the catalyst dx ® instrument partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our vettest ® instrument as catalyst dx ® instruments have replaced vettest ® instruments at certain customers instrument service revenue also contributed to revenue growth as our active installed base of instruments covered under service contracts continued to increase lower average unit sales prices for instruments were primarily related to sales of our lasercyte ® analyzers resulting from discounts associated with customer purchase programs changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a meaningful impact on reported instruments and consumables revenue growth 

the slight increase in rapid assay revenue was due to higher practicelevel sales resulting from increased sales volumes of canine combination test products and snap ® cpl ™  our test for pancreatitis in dogs partly offset by lower sales volumes of feline combination test products to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices also contributed to the increase in rapid assay revenue changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a meaningful impact on reported rapid assay revenue growth 

the increase in laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact of higher testing volume and price increases higher testing volume was the result of growth in our customer base and the impact of new test offerings to a lesser extent revenue was also favorably impacted by incremental sales from businesses acquired in 2009 

the increase in practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems and peripheral equipment and support services related to our practice information management systems these favorable items were partly offset by lower sales of equine radiography systems lower average unit prices for companion animal radiography systems and lower sales of cornerstone ® practice information management systems 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines and therefore did not have significant pharmaceutical product revenue in 2009 we have retained certain intellectual property and licenses for developed products as well as certain less significant product lines which have been reassigned to other lines of business prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  37 

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher average unit sales prices partly offset by lower sales volume of certain water products higher average unit sales prices were attributable to a favorable mix of product sales within certain markets the impact of price increases for certain products sold in the us and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at higher average unit sales prices 

production animal segment the decrease in pas revenue resulted primarily from the impact of the timing of revenue recognition on shipments to a customer where revenue for shipments to that customer is recognized on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectability and lower average unit sales prices these unfavorable items were partly offset by higher overall sales volumes 

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of dairy and opti medical products higher dairy volume was primarily attributable to dairy snap ® antibiotic residue tests a recently released dairy snap ® residue test for detection of melamine and a recently launched instrument these favorable items were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for opti medical products 

gross profit 

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage of less than one percentage point to 49 the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the absence of higher margin pharmaceutical product sales in 2009 higher relative sales of lower margin products and services primarily idexx vetlab ® instruments and laboratory diagnostic and consulting services higher product overhead spending due in part to investment in facilities and production equipment to meet anticipated future demand and the impact of lower volumes of most of our instruments except for catalyst dx ® and snapshot dx ® analyzers these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by gross profit improvement in our laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business due in part to higher selling prices and operational efficiencies lower depreciation expense associated with idexx vetlab ® instruments previously placed under rental agreements also favorably impacted gross profit percentage 

water gross profit for water increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 645 from 63 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of lower royalty costs and to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices these favorable items were partly offset by higher overall manufacturing costs and higher costs related to product distribution 

production animal segment gross profit for pas decreased due to lower sales volume and a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 68 the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher costs of product manufacturing and the impact of lower revenue recognized related to a customer where revenue is recognized on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectability these items were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency hedge contracts and the favorable currency impact on foreign currency denominated expenses net of the unfavorable impact the strengthening of the us dollar had on sales denominated in foreign currencies and lower royalty costs 

  38 

other gross profit for other increased due to higher sales volume and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 45 from 44 the increase in gross profit percentage was due to lower overall costs of product manufacturing in our opti medical and dairy businesses and to a lesser extent greater relative sales of higher margin dairy snap ® tests and opti medical instrument consumables these favorable items were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices of opti medical products 

operating expenses and operating income 

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

 

 

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

 

as previously described we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines and restructured the remainder of this business in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result we did not incur meaningful expenses related to this business in 2009 and will not incur meaningful expenses in the future this impact on sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense and research and development expense is referred to in the following operating expense analysis as the impact of the “pharmaceutical transaction” in relation to restructuring the remainder of the pharmaceutical business certain research and development personnel were realigned to our corporate research and development team for which expenses are not allocated to our operating segments a portion of the decrease in spending explained within the cag section is due to this restructuring 

  39 

the decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the effects of the pharmaceutical transaction and from the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses these decreases were partly offset by higher personnel and personnelrelated costs due in part to the addition of customer support sales and marketing personnel and an increase in facility expenses related to completion of significant phases of our headquarters expansion project in 2009 the decrease in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the effects of the pharmaceutical transaction and lower bad debt expense these decreases were partly offset by an impairment charge of 15 million to write off an acquired intangible asset associated with our equine digital radiography business to a lesser extent the decreases noted were also offset by an increase in spending related to general support functions in the us and europe and incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2009 comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses and transaction related expenses the decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a decrease in spending related to the pharmaceutical business 

water the following table presents water expenses by functional area 

 

the decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses lower spending on consulting services and a decrease in spending on travel the increase in general and administrative expense resulted from higher bad debt expense and higher spending on corporate support function expenses partly offset by lower legal expenses and the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to an increase in spending associated with enhancing the functionality of an existing product qualifying second source suppliers of certain raw materials and new product development these increases were partly offset by lower spending related to product registration related fees and the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses 

production animal segment the following table presents pas operating expenses by functional area 

 

the decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and lower spending on marketing activities the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnel costs and higher legal spending partly offset by the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and lower intangible asset amortization expense the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase in spending on product development increased personnelrelated expenses and increased spending on supplies partly offset by the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses 

  40 

other operating expenses for other operating units increased 01 million to 136 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the unfavorable impact of an increase in deferred compensation expense associated with an employee plan assumed in the acquisition of opti medical higher personnelrelated costs and higher bad debt expense were almost entirely offset by the receipt of a milestone payment and to a lesser extent by lower spending on marketing materials and advertising in our opti medical and dairy businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009 we received a milestone payment of 2 million related to the sale of product rights in connection with the disposition of our pharmaceutical division in the fourth quarter of 2008 the receipt of this payment was due to the achievement of certain development milestones by the third party that purchased the product rights because we have no obligation to deliver product or services or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement receipt of milestone payments are included in results of operations but are not classified as revenue as the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a product line we may receive up to 95 million of future payments based on the achievement of future sales milestones by this third party additional milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of the milestone 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 06 million to 128 million for the year ended december 31 2009 due to the writeoff of capitalized costs related to an information technology project and higher expense related to sharebased compensation these increases were partly offset by the impact of the fourth quarter 2008 sale of our acarexx ® and surpass ® pharmaceutical products and a product that was under development and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical division in 2008 we recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately 15 million of which 11 million was recorded in general and administrative expense 03 million was recorded in sales and marketing expense and 01 million was recorded in research and development expense 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income was 05 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 23 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in interest income was due to lower effective interest rates partly offset by higher average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 19 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 46 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in interest expense was due to lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt balances partly offset by lower capitalized interest and higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 300 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 317 for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in tax rate was due primarily to the recognition of tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations settlement of an audit in an international tax jurisdiction and the writeoff of nondeductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 these benefits were partly offset by a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 due to a change in the statutory tax rates for a jurisdiction in which we operate this nonrecurring benefit of approximately 15 million reduced our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 by 09 percentage points 

in the next year it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to 15 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2009 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various us and international tax jurisdictions

instruments and consumables revenue increased due to higher consumables sales volumes for most of our analyzers and higher average unit sales prices primarily on slides that are sold for use in our chemistry analyzers additionally increased revenue was due to higher instrument sales volumes due primarily to sales of recently launched instruments including catalyst dx ® chemistry analyzers and snapshot dx ® analyzers which we began shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008 and sales of coag dx ™ blood coagulation analyzers which we began shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of 2007 the increase in volumes due to the placement of recently launched instruments was partly offset by a decrease in sales of most of our other idexx vetlab ® instruments due primarily to increased market penetration and a shift in focus of our sales team to our newer instruments the lower sales of our other idexx vetlab ® instruments was also due to lower average unit sales prices due largely to increased promotional discounting higher instrument service revenue was due to the increase in number of instruments covered under service contracts as we continue to increase our active installed base of instruments 

sales volumes of consumables in the us and canada in the first half of 2007 benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in march 2007 we believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual number of pet visits to veterinary clinics in north america in the first and second quarters of 2007 we estimate that this event negatively impacted yearoveryear growth in sales of instruments and consumables for the year ended december 31 2008 by approximately 1 the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by 1 

the increase in practicelevel sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average unit sales prices and higher sales volumes higher average unit sales prices were due primarily to the impact of price increases of certain canine and feline combination tests and to a lesser extent less promotional discounting in connection with our snap ® up the savings ™ and other customer programs and higher relative sales of canine combination test products versus single assay test products increased volume was due primarily to increased us practicelevel sales of our canine combination test products such as the snap ® 4dx ®  and the july 2007 launch of snap ® cpl ™  our test for pancreatitis in dogs the favorable impacts on rapid assay sales noted above were partly offset by a decrease in the volume of sales of products under our distribution agreement with agen biomedical limited the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 2 

the increase in sales of laboratory diagnostic and consulting services resulted from higher testing volume and the impact of price increases as discussed above the first half of 2007 benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the march 2007 pet food recall we estimate that this event negatively impacted yearoveryear growth in laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 by approximately 1 

the increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems partly offset by lower sales of equine radiography systems lower average unit prices for companion animal radiography systems and lower sales of cornerstone ® practice information management systems 

revenue from the sales of pharmaceutical products was unchanged as the higher average unit sales price of pzi vet ®  our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats was offset by lower sales volumes of acarexx ® and surpass ® pharmaceutical products as previously discussed in a series of transactions in the fourth quarter of 2008 we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines we retained certain intellectual property and licenses for developed products as well as certain less significant product lines which were reassigned to other business units see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included in this annual report on form 10k 

water the increase in water revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices higher sales volumes were attributable to the increased sales of our colilert ® products used to detect total coliforms and e coli in water and the commencement in september 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by life technologies corporation which increased reported water revenue growth by 5 

production animal segment the increase in pas revenue resulted from increased sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices the increase in volume resulted primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales including sales attributable to institut pourquier a francebased manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products that we acquired in march 2007 the yearoveryear growth in sales of pourquier products contributed 3 to pas revenue growth the decrease in average unit sales prices was due primarily to a reduction in average price for our postmortem test for bse 

  43 

other the increase in other revenue was due primarily to higher sales volume of our opti medical consumable products and to a lesser extent higher sales volume of dairy snap ® antibiotic residue tests 

gross profit 

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment 

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased due to increased sales volume in all cag product and service lines except the pharmaceutical business and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 49 from 48 the gross profit percentage in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by the writeoff of pharmaceutical inventory and of a prepaid royalty related to our navigator ® product as discussed below which favorably impacted the comparison of current year gross profit percentage to prior year gross profit percentage by 1 the increase in the 2008 gross profit percentage was also due to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses lower cost of slides that are sold for use in our chemistry analyzers and higher average unit sales prices on canine combination test products these favorable items were partly offset by higher relative sales of lower margin laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and idexx vetlab ® instruments and also by higher manufacturing costs of our instruments including our catalyst dx ® chemistry analyzer 

during 2007 we recognized a writedown of raw material inventory of nitazoxanide “ntz” the active ingredient associated with our navigator ® product of 91 million and a writeoff of a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ® paste we wrote down these assets because the thirdparty contract manufacturer of finished goods notified us that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009 additionally product sales were lower than projected we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms and that we would not be able to obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement because the estimated production volume was low accordingly we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions additionally because of lower sales volume estimates and the reduced product life we determined that we would not realize our related investment in prepaid royalties and therefore fully expensed this asset in the fourth quarter of 2008 we cancelled our supply agreement for ntz and sold our remaining raw material inventory back to the supplier for 20 million payable in monthly installments of 25000 through december 2010 with the remaining balance then due we will recognize these payments in our results of operations when they are received due to uncertain collectibility 

water gross profit for water increased due primarily to increased sales volume gross profit percentage remained approximately constant at 63 as lower overall costs of manufacturing and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expense were offset by the impact of greater relative sales of lower margin products consisting primarily of water testing kits manufactured by life technologies corporation that we began distributing in september 2007 discrete costs incurred as a result of discontinuing a project to qualify a second source supplier for certain products and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices

production animal segment gross profit for pas increased due to increased sales volume and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 68 from 62 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent higher relative sales of higher margin livestock diagnostic tests the impact of revenue recognized in 2008 on shipments prior to january 1 2008 to a customer for which we recognize revenue on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectibility and the favorable settlement of a royalty liability the gross profit percentage in 2007 was negatively affected by 1 as a result of purchase accounting for inventory acquired with the pourquier business these favorable impacts were partly offset by the impact of lower average unit sales prices 

other gross profit for other increased due primarily to increased sales volume and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 44 from 41 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses the gross profit percentage in 2008 also improved due to an initial payment under a royaltybearing license agreement related to certain intellectual property under this agreement we received an initial payment and are entitled to receive a total of 33 million in future milestone payments in addition to royalties based on future product sales milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of each of the milestones these favorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of lower margin products

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel and personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded worldwide sales and marketing and the addition of customer service headcount to a lesser extent the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and increased spending on customer support systems also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense these increases were partly offset by lower overall spending on commissions and distributor incentives and marketing programs 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on corporate support functions incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2007 comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent increased bad debt expense and higher personnel costs due in part to increased headcount these increases were partly offset by the absence of nonrecurring costs incurred in 2007 related to acquisitions 

the decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a decrease in product development spending due to the completion of the development of our catalyst dx ® chemistry analyzer and our quantitative immunoassay platform snapshot dx ®  both of which we began shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008 and to lower external consulting costs related to our pharmaceuticals product line these decreases were largely offset by higher personnel costs to support development initiatives related primarily to idexx vetlab ® instrumentation rapid assay and digital radiography products

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel and personnelrelated costs due primarily to expanded headcount and to a lesser extent the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased headcount and costs incurred in connection with the termination of a supply agreement partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase in professional fees and increased headcount partly offset by the absence in 2008 of costs incurred in 2007 related to a regulatory study conducted to support a new test for drinking water

production animal segment the following table presents pas operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent increased personnel and personnelrelated costs and incremental activities associated with the pourquier business which was acquired in march 2007 these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by costs incurred in 2007 associated with terminating a distribution agreement which favorably impacted the comparison of current year sales and marketing expense to the prior year and by increased recruiting costs associated with the increase in headcount the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnel costs the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the pourquier business which are comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets these increases were partly offset by lower overall spending on corporate support function expenses the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased headcount and the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses partly offset by a decrease in spending on research and development supplies and on thirdparty consulting firms used to conduct research 

other operating expenses for other increased 21 million to 136 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due primarily to higher spending on corporate support function expenses increased personnel costs partly due to increased headcount and to incremental expenses related to opti medical which was acquired in january 2007 these increases were partly offset by a reduction in deferred compensation liability related to a deferred compensation plan assumed in the opti medical acquisition the deferred compensation liability is determined based on the value of the investments in an underlying consolidated trust the unrealized loss on the marketable securities in the trust is recorded through other comprehensive income 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 43 million to 122 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due primarily to increased corporate research and development spending on software and systems research and development related to integration of our veterinary product and service offerings to a lesser extent the increase in operating expenses was also attributable to the sale of our acarexx ® and surpass ® pharmaceutical products and a product that was under development and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical division we recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately 15 million of which 11 million was recorded in general and administrative expense 03 million was recorded in sales and marketing expense and 01 million was recorded in research and development expense in 2008 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income was 23 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 28 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in interest income was due to lower effective interest rates partly offset by higher average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 46 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 42 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility partly offset by lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt balances and incremental capitalized interest 

  47 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 317 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 303 for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several nonrecurring items first we wrote off nondeductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 additionally the increase in tax rate was impacted by certain nonrecurring items that favorably impacted the tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 including the reduction of deferred tax liabilities due to a change in international tax rate and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an audit in 2007 these items were partly offset by tax benefits related to a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 and the 2007 reduction of deferred tax assets due to changes in statutory income tax rates for jurisdictions in which we operate 

recent accounting pronouncements 

a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included in this annual report on form 10k 

in september 2009 authoritative literature was issued that modifies the revenue recognition guidance for establishing separate units of accounting and additionally how to recognize revenue for the sale of tangible products that contain software that is more than incidental to the functionality of the product as a whole the revised guidance becomes effective on january 1 2011 however may be early adopted as of the beginning of the 2009 fiscal year we have made the election to adopt these changes as of january 1 2010 adoption of the revisions to the authoritative guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our unsecured shortterm revolving credit facility “credit facility” at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had 1067 million and 789 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 1200 million and 606 million respectively additionally at december 31 2009 we had remaining borrowing availability under our credit facility of 802 million we believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs for the next twelve months we further believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives however based on the current credit market we believe that the interest rates financial covenants and other terms of such borrowings would be less favorable than those applicable to our current credit facility and those which otherwise would have been available historically 

we consider the operating earnings of certain nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences subject to this policy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries our foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us

sources and uses of cash 

the following table presents cash provided used 

 

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was 1750 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 1433 million for the same period in 2008 we historically have experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher or net positive cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period several factors contribute to the seasonal fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities including the following 

 

 

 

the total of net income and net noncash charges was 1853 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 1768 million for the same period in 2008 during the year ended december 31 2009 cash decreased by 103 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to a decrease in the same period of 2008 of 335 million resulting in a yeartoyear increase in cash of 232 million 

  49 

the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities 

 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we realized cash related to investments made during 2008 in inventories and accounts receivable at december 31 2008 higher inventory balances as compared to balances at december 31 2007 related primarily to catalyst dx ® analyzers digital radiography instruments and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers in 2009 higher sales of catalyst dx ® analyzers and other products combined with specific efforts to manage growth in inventory of all of our products favorably impacted the change in our cash position this favorable impact was partly offset by the impact of a large reduction of slides inventory from 2007 to 2008 as compared to an increase in slides inventory balances from 2008 to 2009 the favorable impact on our cash position due to changes in accounts receivable was driven by improved collection of cash from customers coupled with growth in sales however sales growth in 2009 was at a slower rate than experienced in 2008 the slowing of sales growth and improved collections caused the use of cash related to accounts receivable to be lower during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior year these increases in cash were partly offset by additional cash used by accounts payable due to timing of payment for slide inventory and accrued expenses related to the timing of payments of royalties and employee benefits during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior year 

investing activities cash used by investing activities was 536 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash used of 916 million for the same period of 2008 the decrease in cash used by investing activities for 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to 398 million less cash used for purchases of property and equipment the decrease in purchases of property and equipment was attributable primarily to a reduction in spending of 264 million for the renovation and expansion of our headquarters facility in westbrook maine which we expect to conclude in the second quarter of 2011 we paid 494 million to purchase fixed assets during the year ended december 31 2009 our total capital expenditure plan for 2010 is approximately 45 million which includes approximately 12 million for the continued renovation and expansion of our westbrook facility approximately 10 million related to information technology hardware and software and the remainder related to investments in machinery and equipment 

we paid 84 million in cash to acquire businesses and certain intangible assets not comprising businesses during the year ended december 31 2009 we paid 68 million in cash to acquire a business and under separate transactions to acquire certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended december 31 2008 and recognized liabilities of 03 million of which 01 million was paid in 2008 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our acquisitions of businesses 

financing activities at december 31 2009 we had 1188 million outstanding under our credit facility of which 48 million was borrowed by our canadian subsidiary and denominated in canadian dollars the applicable interest rates on the credit facility generally range from 0375 to 0875 percentage points “credit spread” above the london interbank rate “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate “cdor” dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility we pay quarterly commitment fees of 008 to 020 dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio on any unused commitment the credit facility agreement contains a subjective material adverse event clause which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the credit facility if we fail to notify the debt holder of such an event the credit facility agreement also contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants as well as customary events of default that would allow any amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be accelerated or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder in the event of noncompliance the financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined by the agreement not to exceed 3to1 at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 

  50 

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 44000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions from the inception of the program in august 1999 to december 31 2009 we repurchased 37706000 shares cash used to repurchase shares during the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was 831 million and 1323 million respectively we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases 

other commitments contingencies and guarantees 

under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for us employees since january 1 2003 we have retained the first 250000 in claim liability per incident and an aggregate claim liability based on payroll for each year the insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims based on this analysis we have recognized expenses of 08 million 09 million and 03 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 are relatively undeveloped and significant additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims our liability for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 could exceed our estimates and we could be liable for up to 19 million and 20 million respectively in excess of the expense we have recognized for the five years ended on or prior to december 31 2007 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability our maximum liability at december 31 2009 is 08 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized in connection with these policies we have outstanding letters of credit totaling 19 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims 

we have commitments outstanding at december 31 2009 for additional purchase price payments of up to 77 million of which 02 million has been accrued in connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets during the current and prior periods all of which are contingent on the achievement by certain acquired businesses of specified milestones 

we are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 24 of our revenues were derived from products manufactured in the us and sold internationally in local currencies the functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency for one of our subsidiaries located in the netherlands the functional currency is the us dollar 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures our corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions market gains and losses are deferred in other current or longterm assets or accruals as appropriate until the contract matures which is the period when the related obligation is settled we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions 

we identify foreign currency exchange risk by regularly monitoring our transactions denominated in foreign currencies we attempt to mitigate currency risk by hedging the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure currency exposure on large purchases of foreign currency denominated products are evaluated in our hedging program and used as natural hedges to offset identified hedge requirements related to intercompany sales 

our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2009 we enter into forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other specific significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year that are in excess of amounts previously hedged accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany sales outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 1169 million and 977 million respectively at december 31 2009 we had 29 million in net unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 13 million in taxes 

our foreign currency exchange risk at december 31 2009 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies including the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would reduce operating income by approximately 79 million in 2010 a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would have the exact opposite impact of a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of our credit facility to the extent that the libor or the cdor increases borrowings under our credit facility bear interest in the range from 0375 to 0875 percentage points above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings which range from one to six months as discussed below we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods commencing march 31 2010 borrowings outstanding at december 31 2009 were 1188 million at a weightedaverage interest rate of 08 based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2009 an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 until march 31 2010 would increase interest expense by approximately 12 million on an annualized basis subsequent to march 31 2010 our forward fixed interest rate swaps commence and based on amounts outstanding at december 31 2009 an increase in libor or the cdor of 1 would decrease interest expense by approximately 04 million on an annualized basis 

  52 

in march 2009 we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of 80 million to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our credit facility under these agreements we will effectively fix our interest exposure on 80 million of our outstanding borrowings for the period commencing march 31 2010 through march 30 2012 by converting our variable interest rate payments to fixed interest rate payments at 2 plus the credit spread the critical terms of the fixed interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the underlying borrowings including notional amounts underlying market indices interest rate reset dates and maturity dates accordingly we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges see note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities

quantitative immunoassay testing  in the first quarter of 2008 we launched the snapshot dx ® analyzer which allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurements of total thyroxine “t 4 ” cortisol and bile acids which assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function the snapshot dx ® analyzer is designed to significantly improve ease of use throughput and menu relative to the previous generation idexx snap ® reader in 2009 the snapshot dx ® analyzer will also read interpret and record the results of certain idexx rapid assay snap ® tests including our feline snap ® fivfelv combo test and canine snap ® cpl™ 

urinalysis  the idexx vetlab ® ua™ analyzer provides rapid semiquantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use 

idexx vetlab ® station  the idexx vetlab ® station “ivls” connects and integrates the information from all the idexx vetlab ® equipment and thus provides laboratory information management system capability we sell the ivls as an integral component of the catalyst dx™ and lasercyte ® systems and also as a standalone hardware platform the ivls includes a user interface to input patient information connect with a practice management information system and to send information to run the individual analyzers ivls also generates one integrated patient report stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap ® test results and sends and receives information from practice information management systems including idexx cornerstone ® and better choice ® systems as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems 

rapid assays 

we provide a broad range of singleuse handheld test kits under the snap ® name that allow quick accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention if required these kits work without the use of instrumentation 

our principal singleuse tests include canine combination parasite tests called snap ® 3dx ®  which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm and snap ® 4dx ®  which additionally tests for anaplasma phagocytophilum  a canine heartwormonly test canine tests for parvovirus and pancreatitis feline combination tests called the snap ® fiv antibodyfelv antigen combo test which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus “fiv” which is similar to the human aids virus and feline leukemia virus “felv” and snap ® feline triple which additionally tests for heartworm a feline test for felv only and canine and feline tests for giardia  a parasitic disease sales of canine parasite tests including the heartworm only test are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice we maintain certain patents concerning diagnostic products for fiv that expire beginning in june 2009 see “part i patents and licenses” 

  5 

in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek ® name that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple samples petchek ® tests offer accuracy ease of use and provides cost advantages to highvolume customers we currently sell petchek ® tests for canine heartworm disease fiv and felv

digital radiography systems and services  our digital radiography systems capture radiograph images in digital form replacing traditional xray film use of digital radiography systems eliminates the need for the film and processor hazardous chemicals and darkroom required for the production of film images and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through contrast management we market and sell three digital radiography systems the idexxdr™ 1417 and the idexxcr™ 1417 systems for use in the small animal eg dog and cat veterinary hospital and the idexx equiview ® dr system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices such as equine practices our digital radiography systems use idexxpacs™ and idexx equiview pacs™ picture archiving and communication system “pacs” software for the viewing manipulation management storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate the pacs software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the cornerstone ® system as well as transferred to other practice information management systems 

water 

we offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in water 

our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 and colisure ® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water these products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards including us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells 

  6 

our enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters our quantitray ® products when used in conjunction with our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ® or enterolert™ products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presenceabsence indication the colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ® and quantitray ® products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries 

our filtamax ® and filtamax xpress ® products are used in the detection of cryptosporidium in water cryptosporidium is a parasite that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested previously testing of water supplies for cryptosporidium was mandated by regulation only in england and wales effective january 1 2009 testing of water supplies for cryptosporidium is no longer required by regulation in england or wales while our customers in these countries may voluntarily continue to test for cryptosporidium after that date we expect that beginning in 2009 we will lose sales of filtamax ® products in england and wales to customers who have tested solely based on regulatory requirements our sales of filtamax ® products in england and wales were 28 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

in september 2007 we commenced distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” the invitrogen kits complement our cryptosporidium and giardia testing products 

production animal segment 

we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and cattle swine and poultry producers our largest product is a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” the european commission recently approved a proposal to revise the monitoring regime for bse in cattle which increased the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bse from 30 months to 48 months it has been estimated that revisions will reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 the revision became effective january 1 2009 and as a result we believe that we will lose a portion of our sales of our postmortem test for bse 

other 

dairy 

our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the snap ® betalactam test our primary customers are dairy producers and processors worldwide who use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk

marketing and distribution 

we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in australia canada china france germany italy japan the netherlands spain switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom sales and marketing expense was 1700 million 1519 million and 1159 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively or 166 of sales in 2008 165 of sales in 2007 and 157 of sales in 2006 

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel outside the us we sell our companion animal diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales force we market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force primarily in the us we market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force we sell our opti ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the us and sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel outside the us we sell our opti ® products primarily through distributors and other resellers 

our largest customers are our us distributors of our products in the cag segment one of our cag distributors butler animal health supply llc accounted for 8 of our 2008 and 2007 revenue 9 of our 2006 revenue and 5 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas we maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and consulting costs were 707 million 673 million and 536 million or 69 of sales in 2008 and 73 of sales in 2007 and 2006 

patents and licenses 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties 

important patents and licenses include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  8 

 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties who are in some cases sole source suppliers to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products 

significant products supplied by third parties include vettest ® chemistry analyzers and consumables vetautoread™ hematology analyzers and consumables vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzers and consumables coag dx™ analyzers and consumables and catalyst dx™ consumables other than electrolyte consumables 

vettest ® slides and catalyst dx™ chemistry slides are supplied by ortho under supply agreements that expire in 2025 the “ortho agreements” we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® slides and catalyst dx ™ chemistry slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest ® slides and catalyst dx™ chemistry slides through 2010 

other analyzers and consumables are purchased under supply agreements with terms ranging from 1 year to 14 years which in some cases may be extended at our option we have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements 

we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from a single supplier these products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay devices production animal testing kits water testing products and blood analyzers including our lasercyte ® hematology analyzers 

we have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products integrate our products develop and maintain effective sales channels attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large human medical diagnostics companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures some of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  9 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

 

 

 

 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing marketing and promotion recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

veterinary diagnostic products  diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases including most of our production animal products and our rapid assay products are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” these products must be approved by aphis before they may be sold in the us the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the fdc act 

these instrument systems also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity “ce” marking for their products 

  10 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ®  quantitray ®  filtamax ® and simplate ® for heterotropic plate counts “hpc” products have been approved by the epa the sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world 

dairy testing products  dairy products used in national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” milkmonitoring programs are regulated by the fda before products requiring fda approval can be sold in the us extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with an fda approved protocol administered by aoac research institute “aoac ri” following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by ncims an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap ® betalactam dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the fda and ncims while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti ® instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti ® products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti ® products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k application 

opti ® products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food drug medical device and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

at december 31 2008 we had approximately 4700 fulltime and parttime employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

our failure to successfully execute certain strategies could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

the companion animal health care industry is very competitive and we anticipate increased competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants our ability to maintain or enhance our historical growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy which include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  11 

if we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted 

a weak economy could result in reduced demand for our products and services 

a substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and practices of veterinarians with respect to diagnostic testing economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to treat certain pet health conditions approve certain diagnostic tests or continue to own a pet in addition concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests a decline in pet visits to the hospital in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests in pet ownership or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests could result in a decrease in diagnostic testing and therefore in our sales of diagnostic products and services 

disruption in financial and currency markets could have a negative effect on our business 

as widely reported financial markets in the us europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for our products and services the inability of pet owners to obtain consumer credit could lead to a decline in pet visits to the veterinarian which could result in a decrease in diagnostic testing likewise a decrease in diagnostic testing could negatively impact the financial condition of the veterinary practices that are our customers which may inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in addition although current economic conditions have not impacted our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations further deterioration in financial markets could adversely affect our access to capital we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar has a negative effect on our business 

strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against the euro the british pound the canadian dollar the japanese yen and the australian dollar adversely affects our results as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the margins on products manufactured in the us and exported to international markets in 2008 approximately 24 of idexx sales were a result of exports from the us 

our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability 

we currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our vetautoread™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte idexx vetlab ® ua™ urinalysis vettest ® chemistry and coag dx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems and certain components and raw materials used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future we could face cost increases or reductions delays or discontinuations in product shipments which could result in our inability to supply the market which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  12 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market 

many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda and the epa most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our opti ® line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability 

our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights in this regard we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with sales of our snap ® fivfelv tests are likely to decline following the expiration in june 2009 of a us patent that we exclusively license that broadly covers products that diagnose feline immunodeficiency virus 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  13 

distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations our financial performance therefore is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph 

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies competitors may develop products that are superior to our products and as a result we may lose existing customers and market share some of our competitors and potential competitors including large diagnostic companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do 

changes in testing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

the market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our production animal products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our production animal dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

effective january 1 2009 testing of water supplies for cryptosporidium is no longer required by regulation in england or wales while our customers in these countries may voluntarily continue to test for cryptosporidium after that date we expect that beginning in 2009 we will lose sales of filtamax ® products in england and wales to customers who have tested solely based on regulatory requirements our sales of filtamax ® products in england and wales were 28 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

effective january 1 2009 the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested for bse in the european union was increased from 30 months to 48 months which has been estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30 as a result we believe that we are likely to lose a portion of our sales of our postmortem test for bse 

consolidation of veterinary hospitals could negatively affect our business 

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us is owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc national veterinary associates and banfield the pet hospital each of which is currently a customer of idexx a similar trend exists in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech our primary competitor in the us market for reference laboratory services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies are likely to use their laboratory services almost exclusively in addition because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services business hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline 

  14 

our inexperience in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

upon acquiring the critical care division of osmetech plc in january 2007 we entered the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the opti ® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our inexperience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market 

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2008 40 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period in addition many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured sourced or both in the us and our costs are incurred in us dollars we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure however an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins additionally a strengthening us dollar could negatively impact the ability of customers outside the us to pay for purchases denominated in us dollars 

the loss of our president chief executive officer and chairman could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w ayers our president chief executive officer and chairman we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr ayers the loss of mr ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  15 

if our quarterly or annual results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings changes in the economy affecting consumer spending and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on june 30 2006 cyntegra inc filed suit against us in the us district court for the central district of california alleging that we had violated us federal antitrust laws and california state unfair trade practices laws the complaint alleged among other things that we were monopolizing the us market for companion animal diagnostic products the plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages for purported lost sales on october 26 2007 the trial court granted summary judgment in our favor on all of cyntegra’s claims and dismissed the suit cyntegra appealed this decision to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit cyntegra filed its opening brief on appeal on may 30 2008 we filed our opposition brief on july 2 2008 and cyntegra filed its reply brief on july 16 2008 we expect the court of appeals to schedule a hearing in mid2009 until then the trial court judgment in our favor remains in place we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously as we believe cyntegra’s claims are without merit 

from time to time we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analyses of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

description of segments  during 2008 we operated primarily through three business segments products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as the companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for production animal health which we refer to as the production animal segment “pas” we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality which we refer to as dairy and products for the human medical diagnostic market which we refer to as opti medical financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments and other activities are combined and presented in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments we added the opti medical operating segment in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the critical care division of osmetech plc in january 2007 

  22 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we sold our acarexx ® and surpass ® veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development and subsequently restructured the remaining pharmaceutical business in connection with this restructuring we realigned two of our remaining product lines to the rapid assay business which is part of our cag segment and realigned the remainder of the business which comprised one product line and two outlicensing arrangements to the other category in addition we maintain active research and development programs some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new technology products or services that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories in such situations the related financial impacts are shown in the other category 

the segment information for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2008 previously financial information related to the product lines realigned to rapid assay and the product line and outlicensing arrangement realigned to other were included in the pharmaceutical business and reported in the cag segment see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2008 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development expenses a portion of sharebased compensation expense interest income and expense and income taxes we allocate most of our sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company in our segment disclosure of gross profit operating expenses and operating income these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts” 

impact of distribution channel on results of operations  because our instrument consumables and rapid assay products are sold in the us and certain other geographies by distributors distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices who are the end users distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying enduser demand for our products as a result fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services give us scale in sales and distribution permit us to offer integrated diseasemanagement solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing and facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems with reference laboratory test data inclinic test data from our idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers and radiographic data in the idexxpacs™ and idexx equiview pacs™ software taken by our digital radiography systems 

  23 

instruments and consumables  our strategy in our idexx vetlab ® instrument business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments the principal instruments used by veterinarians for inclinic diagnostic testing are chemistry and hematology analyzers in addition we sell instruments used for endocrinology blood gas electrolytes urinalysis and blood coagulation testing our idexx vetlab ® station is an inclinic laboratory information management system that records and integrates patient diagnostic information from our analyzers for better practice management additionally we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments 

during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables and therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross margins in this line of business 

our catalyst dx™ analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer which was launched in the first quarter of 2008 in addition we sell and have an active installed base of approximately 30000 vettest ® chemistry analyzers with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumables sales we continue to place vettest ® instruments through sales lease rental and other programs a substantial portion of 2008 catalyst dx™ analyzer placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vettest ® chemistry analyzer as we continue to experience growth in sales of catalyst dx™ analyzers and the related consumables we expect to see a decline in the sales of vettest ® consumables based on projections of future sales volume and the average unit price of consumables used in the catalyst dx™ and vettest ® analyzers we do not expect a future shift to catalyst dx™ consumables to significantly impact gross margin we do however expect nearterm downward pressure on gross margin percentage due to higher relative instrument placement revenues as compared to consumable sales with continued penetration of the catalyst dx™ analyzer our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

we purchase the chemistry consumables other than electrolyte slides used in our catalyst dx™ and vettest ® chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2025 this supply agreement provides us with a longterm source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010 and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume 

our principal hematology analyzer is the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and in addition we sell the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread™ although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables lasercyte ® consumable sales have been partly offset by declines in sales of vetautoread™ consumables because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte ® consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the vetautoread™ consumables gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ease of use ability to handle compromised samples time to result analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® station education and training and superior sales and customer service our instruments and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies premium pricing 

  24 

rapid assay products  our rapid assay business consists primarily of singleuse kits for pointofcare testing and to a limited degree microwellbased kits for laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests through superior performance including by providing our customers with proprietary combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes where alternative pointofcare offerings exist we seek to differentiate our tests with superior performance as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer service these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which we believe do not include a similar level of support we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing we also seek to enhance efficiency and test result capture by providing our customers the ability to have rapid assay tests read and results recorded into the patient record by our snapshot dx ® analyzer this functionality is currently available for quantitative measurements of total thyroxine “t 4 ” cortisol and bile acids which assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function respectively we are currently developing this functionality across our canine and feline family of rapid assay products 

veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service technology employed and specialized test menu revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers including through laboratory acquisitions customer list acquisitions and opening new laboratories in 2006 we acquired laboratories in the us south africa and canada and acquired a veterinary laboratory customer list in the us in 2007 we acquired laboratories in the us and canada and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us switzerland and united kingdom in 2008 we acquired a laboratory in spain and acquired certain intellectual property and distribution rights associated with a diagnostic test product profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several years while we implement operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 

practice information systems and digital radiography  these businesses consist of veterinary practice information systems including hardware and software and veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems our strategy in the practice information systems business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives we differentiate our software systems through enhanced functionality and ease of use our veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals the digital radiography systems also incorporate idexxpacs™ and idexx equiview pacs™ picture archiving and communication software developed by idexx that allows for image enhancement manipulation storage and retrieval and integration with the practice information software our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the companion animal group 

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities government laboratories and private certified laboratories to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important international sales of water testing products represented 48 of total water product sales in 2008 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

  25 

production animal segment 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle swine and poultry diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can fluctuate in 2008 approximately 85 of our sales in this business were international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business internationally see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

other 

dairy  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverage almost exclusively the snap ® platform as well as the production equipment of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection in 2008 approximately 77 of our sales in this business were international to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in geographies outside the us and in the processor segment of the dairy market defend our share of the farm segment of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions 

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use menu convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

opti medical systems also supplies our vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzer an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the idexx vetlab ® suite for the veterinary market in addition opti medical systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the catalyst dx™ analyzer our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat ® and catalyst dx™ platforms for veterinary applications 

other  we have developed certain proprietary technology that we believe may have application in areas that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories our strategy is to outlicense these technologies to partners that are best positioned to complete the development and commercialization of products utilizing these technologies to the extent we are successful in doing so we may receive onetime or recurring payments based on the achievement of development or sales milestones our ability to succeed in this area of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific personnel to develop proprietary products or technology and our ability to identify suitable third parties to complete the commercialization of these technologies

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2008 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

revenue recognition 

customer programs  we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits or award points award points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us andor toward future purchases of our products or services we establish accruals for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and incentive offerings for each program based on numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits points earned but not yet issued and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current revenue in our analysis we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected inhouse that details the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic “practicelevel sales data” 

  27 

idexx points  customers can earn points based on their participation in certain customer programs and making qualifying purchases related to those programs points may then be applied against the purchase price for idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us as points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to expire or breakage using historical forfeiture rates on november 30 of each year unused points earned before january 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate 

within our overall idexx points program our two most significant customer programs are practice developer ® and snap ® up the savings tm “suts” both of which are offered only to north american customers for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we recorded revenue reductions of 77 million 68 million and 51 million respectively related to our practice developer ® program and 40 million 43 million and 49 million respectively related to our suts program at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the total accrued revenue reductions were 152 million 151 million and 140 million respectively following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to idexx points customer programs and incentive offerings in total and individually for our practice developer ® and suts programs for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006  in thousands  

 

 

   28 

practice developer ®  our practice developer ® program is a companion animal group awards program that permits customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly minimums in certain product and service categories including idexx reference laboratories services catalyst dx™ and vettest ® slides vettest ® snap ® reader reagents lasercyte ® and vetautoread™ tubes feline and canine snap ® tests and service and maintenance agreements the accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter based on sales to end users during the quarter by either us or our distributors and on our estimate of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the quarter 

suts  suts is our volume incentive program for selected snap ® tests that provides customers with benefits in the form of 1 discounts off invoice at the time of purchase and 2 points under the idexx points program awarded quarterly throughout the suts program year which ends on august 31 based on total purchase volume of qualified snap ® products during the year under the suts program commencing september 1 2008 customers receive a 5 rebate of their purchase price if they purchase a minimum volume of products either from us or our distributors we cannot be certain what percentage of customers will purchase the minimum volume of products until that program year has ended at the beginning of the program year we develop an estimate of the percentage of customers that we expect to meet the minimum purchase threshold over the program period based on program enrollee purchasing patterns historical experience with similar programs current sales trends and marketing analysis the percentage of customers expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold is adjusted quarterly during the program year based on our experience with the program and finalized when the program year ends in august the 5 revenue reduction is calculated quarterly based on the applicable gross sales during the period at enduser prices and the estimated percentage of end users that are expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold by the end of the program year the accrued revenue reduction also includes our estimate of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the quarter 

if the estimated percentage of customers expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold required to receive the 5 rebate under the suts program were to increase or decrease by 5 we would be required to further reduce revenue or increase revenue respectively by 01 million 

doubtful accounts receivable  we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances might be required account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the receivable will not be recovered writeoffs of customer accounts during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 07 million 10 million and 06 million respectively 

inventory valuation 

we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand market conditions and remaining shelf life if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations certain major components of inventory for which we have made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below 

lasercyte ® hematology analyzer  at december 31 2008 and 2007 29 million and 27 million respectively of inventory associated with our lasercyte ® hematology instrument required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods which was net of 22 million and 17 million respectively of writedowns for inventory estimated to be obsolete we determined writedowns based on our estimate of the costs to rework inventory compared to replacement cost and the probability of success primarily based on historical experience we expect to fully realize our net investment in this inventory however if we are unsuccessful reworking this inventory if we revise our judgment of our ability to successfully rework inventory due to new experience in reworking this inventory or if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or if applicable fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net assets over the purchase price collectively “fair value” of the acquired business if a market value is not readily available the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when deemed appropriate by management we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” for impairment testing the fair values of the reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the cash flows used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time changes in forecast cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however at december 31 2008 a 25 decrease in the current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge for any of our reporting units that include goodwill no impairments were identified as a result of the annual or eventdriven reviews during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 or 2006 

during 2008 we sold certain pharmaceutical product lines and pharmaceutical assets that qualified as a business the pharmaceutical business had 137 million of related goodwill of which we wrote off approximately 72 million that was allocated to the product lines sold based on their respective fair values fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach a substantial portion of the remaining goodwill is associated with products that have been licensed to third parties and is included in our “other” segment realization of this goodwill is dependant upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time no impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2008 or 2006 

during 2007 we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ® paste we also recognized a related inventory writedown and the circumstances are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions we determined that we would not realize our investment in prepaid royalties and therefore fully expensed this asset no other impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2007 

sharebased compensation 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” on january 1 2006 beginning in 2006 we modified our sharebased employee compensation programs to shift from the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of restricted stock units and stock options along with employee stock purchase rights there were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2008 2007 or 2006 

  30 

in connection with the adoption of sfas no 123r we adopted the straightline method to prospectively expense sharebased awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 the gradedvesting or accelerated method has been used to calculate the expense for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 if the total fair value of sharebased compensation awards as well as other features that impact expense including forfeitures and capitalization of costs was consistent from yeartoyear in each of the last five years and through 2010 this change in expense method from gradedvesting to straightline expensing would yield decreasing annual expense through 2010 until awards granted prior to january 1 2006 were fully expensed however the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of an option the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2008 67 million would have increased or decreased by approximately 7 if the stock price volatility assumption were increased or decreased by 10 to 275 or 225 respectively the total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended december 31 2008 would have increased or decreased by 01 million if the stock price volatility assumption were increased or decreased by 10 to 275 or 225 respectively 

to develop the expected term assumption for option awards we previously elected to use the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 107 which is based on vesting and contractual terms beginning in january 2008 we derive the expected term assumption for options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise the expected term for future awards will be determined using a consistent method longer expected term assumptions increase the fair value of option awards and therefore increase the expense recognized per award the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2008 67 million would have increased or decreased by approximately 12 if the expected term assumption were increased or decreased by one year respectively the total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended december 31 2008 would have increased or decreased by 02 million if the expected term assumption were increased or decreased by one year respectively 

we determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant as such we may use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates the weighted average of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant is as follows 

 

sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results sharebased compensation costs for the year ended december 31 2008 were 102 million which is net of a reduction of 18 million for actual and estimated forfeitures changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment by certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and therefore on sharebased compensation expense 

the fair value of options restricted stock units deferred stock units with vesting conditions and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 totaled 187 million 182 million and 119 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2008 before consideration of estimated forfeitures was 309 million we estimate that this cost will be reduced by approximately 31 million related to forfeitures the weighted average remaining expense recognition period is approximately 2 years 

  31 

income taxes 

we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards net of valuation allowances was 75 million and 154 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2008 would not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in two subsidiaries where a 5 reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of 11 million for those subsidiaries 

for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made similarly a determination that a higher valuation allowance is required would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by 04 million this increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we consider certain operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were 1556 million at december 31 2008 no provision has been made for us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accrued taxes on a current basis 

we record a liability for uncertain tax provisions in accordance with fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition measurement and financial statement disclosure of uncertain tax positions this comprehensive model requires us to assess all tax positions against a more likely than not standard we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change resolution or expiration occurs as of december 31 2008 our net liability for uncertain tax positions was 69 million which includes interest expense and penalties

results of operations 

twelve months ended december 31 2008 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2007 

revenue 

total company revenue increased 1015 million or 11 to 1024 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 incremental sales from businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2007 contributed 1 to revenue growth these acquisitions consisted primarily of veterinary reference laboratories and customer lists in canada the united states and europe a production animal diagnostic products business in france and the critical care division of osmetech plc which we refer to as opti medical the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 1 to revenue growth the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

 

 

 companion animal group the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

 

 

   33 

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us and net of incremental sales from veterinary reference laboratory businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2007 

instruments and consumables revenue increased due to higher consumables sales volumes for most of our analyzers and higher average unit sales prices primarily on slides that are sold for use in our chemistry analyzers additionally increased revenue was also due to higher instrument sales volumes due primarily to sales of recently launched instruments including catalyst dx™ chemistry analyzers and snapshot dx ® analyzers which we began shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008 and sales of coag dx™ blood coagulation analyzers which we began shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of 2007 the increase in volumes due to the placement of recently launched instruments was partly offset by a decrease in sales of most of our other idexx vetlab ® instruments due primarily to increased market penetration and a shift in focus of our sales team to our newer instruments we anticipate that in future periods as we continue to penetrate the market with our nextgeneration chemistry analyzer catalyst dx™ sales of our vettest ® chemistry analyzers will decline the lower sales of our other idexx vetlab ® instruments was also due to lower average unit sales prices due largely to increased promotional discounting higher instrument service revenue was due to the increase in number of instruments covered under service contracts as we continue to increase our active installed base of instruments 

sales volumes of consumables in the us and canada in the first half of 2007 benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in march 2007 we believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual number of pet visits to veterinary clinics in north america in the first and second quarters of 2007 we estimate that this event negatively impacted yearoveryear growth in sales of instruments and consumables for the year ended december 31 2008 by approximately 1 the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by 1 

the increase in practicelevel sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average unit sales prices and higher sales volumes higher average unit sales prices were due primarily to the impact of price increases of certain canine and feline combination tests and to a lesser extent less promotional discounting in connection with our snap ® up the savings™ and other customer programs and higher relative sales of canine combination test products versus single assay test products we expect that the rate of end users’ conversion from canine heartwormonly tests to combination test products will slow in future periods which will decelerate the rate of increase in average unit sales prices increased volume was due primarily to increased us practicelevel sales of our canine combination test products such as the snap ® 4dx ®  and the july 2007 launch of snap ® cpl™ our test for pancreatitis in dogs the favorable impacts on rapid assay sales noted above were partly offset by a decrease in the volume of sales of products under our distribution agreement with agen biomedical limited the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 2 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted from higher testing volume and the impact of price increases as discussed above the first half of 2007 benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the march 2007 pet food recall we estimate that this event negatively impacted yearoveryear growth in laboratory and consulting services revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 by approximately 1 

the increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems partly offset by lower sales of equine radiography systems lower average unit prices for companion animal radiography systems and lower sales of cornerstone ® practice information management systems

revenue from the sales of pharmaceutical products was unchanged as the higher average unit sales price of pzi vet ®  our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats was offset by lower sales volumes of acarexx ® and surpass ® pharmaceutical products as discussed above in a series of transactions in the fourth quarter of 2008 we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines and therefore will not have meaningful pharmaceutical product revenue in 2009 or future years we have retained certain intellectual property and licenses for developed products as well as certain less significant product lines which have been reassigned to other business units see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2008 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  34 

water revenue for water increased 82 million or 12 to 745 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 662 million for the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices higher sales volumes were attributable to the increased sales of our colilert ® products used to detect total coliforms and e coli in water and the commencement in september 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen which increased reported water revenue growth by 5 

production animal segment revenue for pas increased 57 million or 8 to 808 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 751 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in revenue resulted from increased sales volume and the favorable impact from currency exchange rates which contributed 5 to pas revenue growth partly offset by lower average unit sales prices the increase in volume resulted primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales including sales attributable to institut pourquier a francebased manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products that we acquired in march 2007 the yearoveryear growth in sales of pourquier products contributed 3 to pas revenue growth the decrease in average unit sales prices was due primarily to a reduction in average price for our postmortem test for bse 

other revenue for other operating units increased 40 million or 13 to 347 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 308 million for the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher sales volume of our opti medical consumable products and to a lesser extent higher sales volume of dairy snap ® antibiotic residue tests the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 3 to the increase in revenue from other operating units 

gross profit 

total company the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 500 million or 14 to 4122 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 3622 million for the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume in all cag product and service lines except the pharmaceutical business and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 49 from 48 the gross profit percentage in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by the writeoff of pharmaceutical inventory and of a prepaid royalty related to our navigator ® product as discussed below which favorably impacted the comparison of current year gross profit percentage to prior year gross profit percentage by 1 the increase in the 2008 gross profit percentage was also due to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses lower cost of slides that are sold for use in our chemistry analyzers and higher average unit sales prices on canine combination test products these favorable items were partly offset by higher relative sales of lower margin laboratory and consulting services and idexx vetlab ® instruments and also by higher manufacturing costs of our instruments including our catalyst dx™ chemistry analyzer for which we have not yet achieved economies of scale

  35 

during 2007 we recognized a writedown of ntz raw materials inventory of 91 million and a writeoff of a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ® paste we wrote down these assets because the thirdparty contract manufacturer of finished goods notified us that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009 additionally product sales were lower than projected we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms and that we would not be able to obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement because the estimated production volume was low accordingly we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions additionally because of lower sales volume estimates and the reduced product life we determined that we would not realize our related investment in prepaid royalties and therefore fully expensed this asset in the fourth quarter of 2008 we cancelled our supply agreement for ntz and sold our remaining raw material inventory back to the supplier for 20 million payable in monthly installments of 25000 through december 2010 with the remaining balance then due we will recognize these payments in our results of operations when they are received due to uncertain collectibility 

water gross profit for water increased 54 million or 13 to 471 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 417 million for the same period of the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume gross profit percentage remained approximately constant at 63 as lower overall costs of manufacturing and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expense were offset by the impact of greater relative sales of lower margin products consisting primarily of water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen that we began distributing in september 2007 discrete costs incurred as a result of discontinuing a project to qualify a second source supplier for certain products and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices 

production animal segment gross profit for pas increased 83 million or 18 to 550 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 467 million for the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 68 from 62 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent higher relative sales of higher margin livestock diagnostic tests the impact of revenue recognized in 2008 on shipments prior to january 1 2008 to a customer for which we recognize revenue on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectibility and the favorable settlement of a royalty liability the gross profit percentage in 2007 was negatively affected by 1 as a result of purchase accounting for inventory acquired with the pourquier business these favorable impacts were partly offset by the impact of lower average unit sales prices 

other gross profit for other operating units increased 27 million or 21 to 151 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 125 million for the same period of the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 44 from 41 the increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those currencies inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses the gross profit percentage in 2008 also improved due to an initial payment under a royaltybearing license agreement related to certain intellectual property under this agreement we received an initial payment and are entitled to receive a total of 33 million in future milestone payments in addition to royalties based on future product sales milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of each of the milestones these favorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of lower margin products

operating expenses and operating income 

total company the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

 

 

companion animal group the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel and personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded worldwide sales and marketing and the addition of customer service headcount to a lesser extent the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and increased spending on customer support systems also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense these increases were partly offset by lower overall spending on commissions and distributor incentives and marketing programs 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on corporate support functions incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2007 comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent increased bad debt expense and higher personnel costs due in part to increased headcount these increases were partly offset by the absence of nonrecurring costs incurred in 2007 related to acquisitions 

the decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a decrease in product development spending due to the completion of the development of our nextgeneration chemistry analyzer catalyst dx™ and our new quantitative immunoassay platform snapshot dx ®  both of which we began shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008 and to lower external consulting costs related to our pharmaceuticals product line these decreases were largely offset by higher personnel costs to support development initiatives related primarily to idexx vetlab ® instrumentation rapid assay and digital radiography products

water the following table presents water expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel and personnelrelated costs due primarily to expanded headcount and to a lesser extent the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased headcount and costs incurred in connection with the termination of a supply agreement partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase in professional fees and increased headcount partly offset by the absence in 2008 of costs incurred in 2007 related to a regulatory study conducted to support a new test for drinking water 

production animal segment the following table presents pas operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent increased personnel and personnelrelated costs and incremental activities associated with the pourquier business which was acquired in march 2007 these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by costs incurred in 2007 associated with terminating a distribution agreement which favorably impacted the comparison of current year sales and marketing expense to prior year and by increased recruiting costs associated with the increase in headcount the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnel costs the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the pourquier business which are comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets these increases were partly offset by lower overall spending on corporate support function expenses the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased headcount and the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses partly offset by a decrease in spending on research and development supplies and on thirdparty consulting firms used to conduct research 

other operating expenses for other operating units increased 21 million to 136 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due primarily to higher spending on corporate support function expenses increased personnel costs partly due to increased headcount and to incremental expenses related to opti medical which was acquired in january 2007 these increases were partly offset by a reduction in deferred compensation liability related to a deferred compensation plan assumed in the opti medical acquisition the deferred compensation liability is determined based on the value of the investments in an underlying consolidated trust the unrealized loss on the marketable securities in the trust is recorded through other comprehensive income 

  38 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased 43 million to 122 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due primarily to increased corporate research and development spending on software and systems research and development related to integration of our veterinary product and service offerings to a lesser extent the increase in operating expenses was also attributable to the sale of our acarexx ® and surpass ® pharmaceutical products and a product that was under development and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical business we recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately 15 million of which 11 million was recorded in general and administrative expense 03 million was recorded in sales and marketing expense and 01 million was recorded in research and development expense in 2008 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income was 23 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 28 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease in interest income was due to lower effective interest rates partly offset by higher average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 46 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 42 million for the same period of the prior year the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility partly offset by lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt balances and incremental capitalized interest 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 317 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 303 for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several nonrecurring items first we wrote off nondeductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 additionally the increase in tax rate was impacted by certain nonrecurring items that favorably impacted the tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 including the reduction of deferred tax liabilities due to a change in international tax rate and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an audit in 2007 these items were partly offset by tax benefits related to a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 and the 2007 reduction of deferred tax assets due to changes in statutory income tax rates for jurisdictions in which we operate 

we anticipate recognizing approximately 14 million of income tax benefits in 2009 that have not been recognized at december 31 2008 in accordance with fin 48 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statute of limitations for various foreign and state tax jurisdictions

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us and net of incremental sales from businesses and from customerrelated and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to higher unit sales volume higher consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide practicelevel sales of slides and to a lesser extent to increased practicelevel sales of tubes used with our hematology analyzers with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued growth of our installed base of instruments sales volumes of consumables also benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in midmarch 2007 in the us and canada we believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual number of pet visits to veterinary clinics in north america in the first and second quarters of 2007 higher instrument sales revenue resulted mainly from increased sales of our lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and to a lesser extent our idexx vetlab ® station an inclinic laboratory information management system the impact from changes in us distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by less than 1 

the increase in practicelevel sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average unit sales prices and higher sales volumes higher average unit sales prices were due in part to higher relative sales of canine combination test products such as the snap ® 4dx ®  which was launched in the us in september 2006 and less promotional discounting in connection with our snap ® up the savings™ and other customer programs we expect the rate of end users’ conversion from canine heartwormonly tests to combination test products and therefore the rate of increase of average unit sales prices will lessen in future periods higher sales volumes resulted in part from the july 2007 launch of the snap ® cpl™ our test for pancreatitis in dogs effective january 2008 we changed our distribution methods in japan from a combination of direct sales and the use of multiple distributors to an exclusive distribution arrangement for our rapid assay products and instrument consumables the impact from the distributor’s initial stocking orders to build inventory levels increased reported revenue growth by 1 the impact from changes in us distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 4 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from higher testing volume and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases higher testing volume was attributable to both new customers and to increased testing volume from existing customers and benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the march 2007 pet food recall as discussed above and from new test offerings 

the increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal and equine radiography systems higher sales of cornerstone ® practice information management systems and services and the favorable impact of implementing tiered support service level offerings with differentiated pricing for our practice information management systems partly offset by lower average unit prices for radiography systems due to increased competition 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from higher sales volume and price increases in each case related largely to pzi vet ®  our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats 

water revenue for water increased 78 million or 13 to 662 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 585 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to both higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices and greater price competition in certain geographies higher sales volumes resulted in part from our commencement in september 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” which increased reported water revenue growth by 2 the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 4 to the increase in water revenue 

production animal segment revenue for pas increased 161 million or 27 to 751 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 589 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales volume including sales attributable to institut pourquier a manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products in france that we acquired in march 2007 sales of pourquier products contributed 12 to pas revenue growth the favorable impact of higher sales volume was partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for our herdchek ® products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies “tses” due to both greater price competition and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 7 to the increase in pas revenue 

  41 

other revenue for other operating units increased 134 million or 77 to 308 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 174 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental revenue attributable to opti medical which was acquired in january 2007 

gross profit 

total company gross profit increased 840 million or 22 to 4635 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 3795 million for the prior year as a percentage of total revenue gross profit decreased to 50 from 51 

during 2007 we recognized a writedown of ntz raw materials inventory of 91 million and a writeoff of a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ®  which resulted in an unfavorable impact of 11 of total company gross profit for the year ended december 31 2007 these writedowns are included in cost of product revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

sharebased compensation expense of 07 million was included in cost of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 11 million for the prior year beginning in 2007 we have allocated sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments based on headcount and other personnel data this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company which was categorized as “unallocated amounts” sharebased compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments in 2006 therefore the total company sharebased compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year ended december 31 2006 

the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by operating segment 

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 651 million or 22 to 3622 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 2971 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product and service lines partly offset by a decrease in gross profit percentage to 48 from 49 the writedown of pharmaceutical inventory and the related prepaid royalty impairment charge discussed above resulted in an unfavorable impact of 14 of cag revenue greater relative sales of lower margin products and services such as laboratory and consulting services and idexx vetlab ® instruments also contributed to the decrease in the gross profit percentage these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of our canine combination test product snap ® 4dx ® and to a lesser extent all other cag product and service lines except in the digital radiography business lower cost of slides that are sold for use in vettest ® chemistry analyzers and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

water gross profit for water increased 32 million or 8 to 417 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 384 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 63 from 66 the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher manufacturing costs lower average unit sales prices and greater relative sales of lower margin products which was primarily due to the lower gross margin earned on certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen that we began distributing in september 2007

  42 

production animal segment gross profit for pas increased 81 million or 21 to 467 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 387 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62 from 66 the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by lower average unit sales prices net higher production costs the effect of purchase accounting for inventory acquired in connection with the pourquier business acquisition and a relatively lower gross profit rate realized on sales by pourquier largely offset by greater relative sales of higher margin products exclusive of the impact of the pourquier business the gross profit percentage earned on sales by pourquier excluding the impact of purchase accounting was lower than our historical pas gross profit rate due to greater price competition in the primary markets served by pourquier additionally purchase accounting for inventory had an unfavorable impact of 08 of pas revenue because finished goods inventory acquired in connection with a business acquisition are assigned a fair value that exceeds replacement cost which results in a low gross margin on the sale of those finished goods by the acquirer additionally decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

other gross profit for other operating units increased 54 million or 77 to 125 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 70 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental revenue attributable to opti medical which resulted in incremental gross profit for the other operating units excluding the acquisition of opti medical the gross profit percentage was 39 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 41 for the prior year the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to lower average unit sales prices for certain dairy products and higher manufacturing and distribution costs partly offset by the favorable impact of the effect of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies

total company total operating expenses increased 757 million or 30 to 3273 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 2516 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating expenses increased to 35 from 34 

sharebased compensation expense of 79 million was included in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 90 million for the prior year beginning in 2007 we allocate sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments as discussed above the total company sharebased compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year ended december 31 2006

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded worldwide sales marketing and customer service support resources and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance additionally the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense and incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded resources and spending on information technology facilities and other general support functions to a lesser extent the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense 

the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product development spending including additional professional resources related primarily to idexx vetlab ® instrumentation and rapid assay products to a lesser extent product development activities in all other cag product and service categories and the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense also contributed to the increases in research and development expense 

  44

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded headcount and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense and higher spending on information technology facilities and other general support functions partly offset by the favorable comparison due to costs incurred during the third quarter of 2006 to consolidate our office and production facilities based in the united kingdom into a single facility and other net cost reductions the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher costs associated with coliform and e coli water test product development 

production animal segment operating expenses for pas increased 88 million or 39 to 313 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 225 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 42 from 38 sharebased compensation expense of 08 million or 10 of revenue was included in pas operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 the following table presents pas operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from incremental activities associated with the pourquier business higher personnelrelated costs and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from incremental expenses associated with the pourquier business comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets and higher spending on information technology facilities and other general support functions to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense these increases were partly offset by a favorable comparison due to the writeoff in the second quarter of 2006 of certain fixed assets located in our facility in china the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher development activities and associated higher personnelrelated costs including incremental development activities attributable to the pourquier business acquired in march 2007 and to a lesser extent the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense 

  45 

other operating expenses for other operating units increased 72 million to 115 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 43 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental expenses attributable to opti medical which was acquired in january 2007 these costs are mainly composed of operating expenses of a recurring nature to support the opti medical business and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired sharebased compensation expense of 03 million or 10 of revenue was included in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased 70 million to 79 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 149 million for the prior year as described above sharebased compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments in 2006 therefore total company sharebased compensation expense included in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 of 90 million was categorized as “unallocated amounts” beginning in 2007 we allocate a portion of sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments the unallocated sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2007 was 05 million corporate research and development expense was also included in “unallocated amounts” for both periods and grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2007 to support increased longterm product development activities 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income was 28 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 33 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in interest income was due primarily to lower invested cash balances partly offset by higher effective interest rates 

interest expense was 42 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 05 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in interest expense was due primarily to interest expense incurred on borrowings under a revolving credit facility 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 303 for the year ended december 31 2007 and 284 for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several nonrecurring items that benefited the tax rate in the year ended december 31 2006 these 2006 items included the resolution of an income tax audit for years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 a reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain multiyear tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability offsetting the impact of the items occurring in 2006 were several favorable impacts to our rate that occurred during the year ended december 31 2007 these items included an increase in certain federal tax incentives due to changes in legislation tax benefits related to reductions in international rates and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an audit 

we anticipate recognizing approximately 05 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2007 in accordance with fin 48 the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statute of limitations for various foreign and state tax jurisdictions

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had 789 million and 604 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of 606 million and 823 million respectively additionally at december 31 2008 we had borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility of 488 million we believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs for the foreseeable future we further believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates to fund our growth objectives however based on the current credit market the interest rates and financial covenants obtained may be less favorable than historical interest rates and the interest rates and financial covenants available to us under our current credit facilities 

  46 

we consider certain operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences subject to this policy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital 

 

sources and uses of cash 

cash generated by operating activities was 1433 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1351 million for the same period in 2007 we historically have experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher or net positive cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period several factors contribute to the seasonal fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities including the following 

 

net income for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 222 million to 1162 million from 940 million for the prior year the total of net income and net noncash charges was 1768 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1361 million for the same period in 2007 resulting in a yeartoyear increase of 407 million the increase is due to an additional 120 million in net income as adjusted for the write down of navigator ® inventory and the associated royalty license impairment and noncash items of 287 million the changes in noncash adjustments are primarily due to an increase in our provision for deferred income taxes of 147 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 77 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2007 the increase in the provision for deferred income taxes is primarily due to the 2007 deferral of a tax deduction for the writedown of navigator ® inventory until 2008 and bonus depreciation taken for tax purposes in the current year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to incremental spending on computer hardware at the end of 2007 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about the navigator ® inventory writedown 

  47 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 cash decreased by 335 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to a decrease in the same period of 2007 of 10 million resulting in incremental cash used of 325 million the increase in cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to 2007 was primarily attributable to 362 million incremental cash used to pay down accounts payable and accrued expenses and 132 million incremental cash used by changes in inventory partly offset by 153 million less cash used by changes in accounts receivable the incremental cash used to reduce accrued expenses was due to greater relative reductions in employeerelated liabilities including management incentive bonuses and the timing of estimated tax payments caused by changes in federal estimated payment rules that became effective in the current year the incremental cash used by changes in inventory was due primarily to increases in certain instrument inventory including the catalyst dx™ chemistry analyzer and the snapshot dx ® analyzer resulting from the launch of the instruments in the first quarter of 2008 the incremental cash provided by decreases in accounts receivable was due to slower sales growth during the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of the prior year 

cash used by investing activities was 916 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to cash used of 1211 million for the same period of 2007 the decrease in cash used by investing activities for 2008 compared to 2007 was largely due to 812 million less cash used for business acquisitions and intangible assets which are described below partly offset by incremental purchases of property and equipment of 241 million and 350 million less cash provided by the sale of investments 

we paid 68 million in cash to acquire a business and under separate transactions to acquire certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended december 31 2008 and recognized liabilities of 03 million of which 01 million was paid in 2008 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our acquisitions of businesses

in january 2007 we entered into an unsecured shortterm revolving credit facility with a bank in the principal amount of 1250 million that matured on june 30 2007 on march 30 2007 we refinanced this shortterm facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility with four multinational banks that matures on march 30 2012 the “credit facility” in february 2008 we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our credit facility to 2000 million and added a fifth bank to the syndication the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our common stock and business acquisitions the applicable interest rates generally range from 0375 to 0875 above the london interbank offered rate the “libor” or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate the “cdor” dependent on our leverage ratio under the credit facility we pay quarterly commitment fees of 008 to 020 dependent on our leverage ratio on any unused commitment the credit facility contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants as well as customary events of default that would allow any amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be accelerated or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder in the event of noncompliance the financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined by the agreement not to exceed 3to1 at december 31 2008 our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization was less than 1to1 at december 31 2008 we had 1506 million outstanding under the credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 23 at december 31 2007 we had 722 million outstanding under the credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 54 our availability under the credit facility was further reduced at december 31 2008 by 06 million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers’ compensation policy which commenced january 1 2009 of the total amount outstanding at december 31 2008 and 2007 66 million and 51 million respectively was borrowed by our canadian subsidiary and denominated in canadian dollars

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk our functional currency is the us dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are in the us but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our subsidiaries our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany sales of product and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below our subsidiaries in 17 foreign countries use the local currency as their functional currency for the year ended december 31 2008 40 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize some natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions market gains and losses are deferred in other current assets or accruals as appropriate until the contract matures which is the period when the related obligation is settled we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 18 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions 

we identify foreign currency exchange risk by regularly monitoring our transactions denominated in foreign currencies we attempt to mitigate currency risk by hedging the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure currency exposure on large purchases of foreign currency denominated products are evaluated in our hedging program and used as natural hedges to offset hedge requirements 

our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2008 we enter into forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other specific significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statement of operations our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 

we enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk the notional amount of foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany sales outstanding at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 977 million and 1221 million respectively at december 31 2008 we had 68 million in net unrealized gains on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 31 million in taxes 

our foreign currency exchange risk at december 31 2008 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies including the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would reduce operating income by approximately 72 million in 2009 a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would have the exact opposite impact of a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the libor increases or the cdor increases borrowings under our credit facility bear interest in the range from 0375 to 0875 above the libor or the cdor dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio and are outstanding from one to six months borrowings outstanding at december 31 2008 were 1506 million at a weightedaverage interest rate of 23 all borrowings outstanding at december 31 2008 matured one month from the date of the borrowing an increase in the libor or the cdor of 1 would increase interest expense by approximately 15 million

recent developments 

on october 25 2007 our board of directors approved a twoforone split of the outstanding shares of our common stock to be effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend each holder of common stock of record as of november 5 2007 received one additional share of common stock the additional shares of common stock were distributed on november 26 2007 all share and per share data except par value in this form 10k have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented 

products and services 

during 2007 we operated primarily through three business segments products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as our companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for production animal health which we refer to as the production animal segment “pas” we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality which we refer to as dairy and products for the human medical diagnostic market which we refer to as opti medical financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments are combined and presented in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments we added the opti medical operating segment in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the critical care division of osmetech plc in january 2007 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2007 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

companion animal group 

instruments and consumables 

we currently market an integrated and highly flexible suite of inhouse laboratory analyzers for use in veterinary practices that we refer to as the idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers the idexx vetlab ® suite includes several instrument systems as well as associated proprietary consumable products that are described below 

blood and urine chemistry  our vettest ® chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions twentysix separate tests can be performed on the vettest ® chemistry analyzer and additional parameters can be calculated blood tests commonly run include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase creatinine blood urea nitrogen “bun” and total protein the vettest ® chemistry analyzer also runs tests for urine proteinurine creatinine ratio which assists in the detection of early renal disease tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels such as the preanesthetic panel the general health profile the equine health panel the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug “nsaid” monitoring panel the avian health profile the quality control panel and the diagnostic health profile 

our vetlyte ® analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration 

our vetstat ® analyzer measures electrolytes blood gases glucose and ionized calcium and calculates other parameters such as bicarbonate and anion gap these measurements aid veterinarians in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function the vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes 

we purchase all of the reagents used in the vettest ® chemistry analyzer “dry chemistry slides” or “vettest ® slides” from orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” a subsidiary of johnson  johnson see the section below within item i “production and supply” in october 2003 we entered into an agreement with ortho under which we are developing a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market named catalyst dx™ which is based primarily on ortho’s dryslide technology ortho will provide slide consumables used in both the vettest ® chemistry analyzer and the new analyzer catalyst dx™ through 2025 catalyst dx™ will provide significantly improved throughput ease of use and menu including the ability to run electrolytes we expect catalyst dx™ to be commercially available in early 2008 and we will be manufacturing this instrument we also expect to be selling and supporting vettest ® for the foreseeable future 

  4 

chemistry reagent sales for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of idexx vetlab ® equipment 

hematology  we sell two hematology analyzers the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer which uses laserflow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets and the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer 

quantitative immunoassay testing  the idexx snap ® reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurements of total thyroxine “t 4 ” cortisol and bile acids which assist in the evaluation of thyroid adrenal and liver function 

we have under development and plan to launch a new quantitative immunoassay platform called snapshot dx™ in early 2008 this product will replace the idexx snap ® reader snapshot dx™ is designed to significantly improve ease of use throughput and menu we will manufacture this instrument and its consumables internally 

blood coagulation  in late 2007 we introduced the coag dx™ analyzer which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders 

urinalysis  our idexx vetlab ® ua™ urinalysis analyzer provides rapid semiquantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use 

idexx vetlab ® station  we sell idexx vetlab ® station “ivls” as an integral component of the lasercyte system and catalyst dx™ following launch and also as a standalone hardware platform in both cases ivls physically connects and integrates all the idexx vetlab ® equipment and provides a laboratory information management system capability ivls includes a user interface to run the individual equipment generates one integrated patient report stores retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data including snap ® test results and connects to practice information management systems including idexx cornerstone ® and better choice ® systems as well as a wide variety of thirdparty systems 

rapid assays 

we provide a broad range of singleuse handheld test kits under the snap ® name that allow quick accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention if required these kits work without the use of instrumentation 

our principal singleuse tests include canine combination parasite tests called snap ® 3dx ®  which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm and snap ® 4dx ®  which additionally tests for anaplasma phagocytophilum  a canine heartwormonly test canine tests for parvovirus and pancreatitis a feline combination test the snap ® combo fiv antibodyfelv antigen test which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus “fiv” which is similar to the human aids virus and feline leukemia virus “felv” a feline test for felv only and canine and feline tests for giardia  a parasitic disease sales of canine parasite tests including the heartworm only test are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice 

in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek ® name that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple samples petchek ® tests offer accuracy ease of use and cost advantages to highvolume customers we currently sell petchek ® tests for canine heartworm disease fiv and felv 

veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services 

we offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians in the us canada europe australia japan and south africa veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals 

  5 

additionally we provide specialized veterinary consultation telemedicine and advisory services including cardiology radiology internal medicine and ultrasound consulting these services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet from the veterinarians’ offices 

practice information systems and digital radiography 

practice information systems and services  we develop market and sell practice information systems including hardware and software that run key functions of veterinary clinics including patient electronic health records management scheduling including boarding and grooming billing and inventory management our principal system is the cornerstone ® system we also provide software and hardware support to our practice information system customers and related supplies and services to veterinary practice information system users in general and we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts 

digital radiography systems and services  our digital radiography systems capture radiograph images in digital form replacing traditional xray film use of digital radiography systems eliminates the need for the film and processor hazardous chemicals and darkroom required for the production of film images and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through contrast management we market and sell three digital radiography systems the idexxdr™ 1417 and the idexxcr™ 1417 systems for use in the small animal eg dog and cat veterinary hospital and the idexx equiview ® dr system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices such as equine practices our digital radiography systems use idexxpacs™ picture archiving and communication system “pacs” software for the viewing manipulation management storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate the idexxpacs™ software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the cornerstone ® system as well as transferred to other practice information management systems 

pharmaceutical products 

we develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for the veterinary market we currently market and sell four pharmaceutical products pzi vet ®  an insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats acarexx ® 001 ivermectin otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats surpass ® 1 diclofenac sodium a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug for equine use and navigator ® 32 nitazoxanide antiprotozoal oral paste a treatment for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis “epm” see “part i item 1a risk factors – we may be required to discontinue sales of one of our veterinary pharmaceutical products” 

water 

we offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in water 

our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 and colisure ® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water these products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards including us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells 

our enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters our quantitray ® products when used in conjunction with our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ® or enterolert™ products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presenceabsence indication the colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ® and quantitray ® products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries 

  6 

our filtamax ® product is used in the detection of cryptosporidium in water cryptosporidium is a parasite that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested testing of water supplies for cryptosporidium has been mandated by regulation only in the united kingdom on december 29 2006 the drinking water inspectorate in the uk published a proposal to discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for cryptosporidium  subsequently regulatory changes were approved and will become effective january 1 2009 beginning in 2009 therefore we believe that we may lose a substantial portion of our sales of filtamax ® products in england and wales which were 28 million in the year ended december 31 2007 effective september 2007 we commenced distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” the invitrogen kits complement our idexx developed cryptosporidium and giardia testing products 

production animal segment 

we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry cattle and swine producers our largest product is a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” other significant products include antemortem diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome “prrs” pseudorabies “prv” in pigs and bovine viral diarrhea “bvdv” virus in cattle

patents and licenses 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties 

important patents and licenses include 

 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties who are in some cases sole source suppliers to supply us with certain important components raw materials and consumables used in or with our products 

vettest ® chemistry analyzers are manufactured for us by tokyo parts industrial company ltd under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew vettest ® slides are supplied exclusively by ortho under supply agreements with ortho the “ortho agreements” we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest ® slides through 2010 under these agreements ortho will also supply the slide consumables used in the catalyst dx™ chemistry analyzer the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2025 

  8 

the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer and related consumables are manufactured for us by qbc diagnostics inc “qbcd” under a supply agreement that expires on december 31 2020 the vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzer is manufactured for us by roche diagnostics corporation under an agreement that requires roche diagnostics to supply analyzers through december 31 2009 provided that we achieve specified purchase levels and consumables and spare parts through december 31 2013 

idexx vetlab ® ua™ urinalysis strips are manufactured for us by roche diagnostics under agreements that expire on december 31 2010 but are renewable at our option through december 31 2020 if we achieve certain purchase levels under those agreements 

idexx vetlab ® ua™ analyzers are manufactured for us by 77 elektronika kft under agreements that expire on december 31 2022 and which require 77 elektronika to supply spare parts for five years following expiration 

the idexx coag dx™ analyzer and associated cartridges are manufactured for us by international technidyne corporation “itc” under an agreement that expires on february 6 2017 but which we may extend until february 6 2022 if we achieve certain minimum purchase levels under the agreement and which requires itc to supply consumables and spare parts for five years following expiration 

we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from a single supplier these include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products certain digital radiography systems certain other instruments instrument consumables and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products and instruments including in lasercyte ® hematology analyzers we have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products integrate our products develop and maintain effective sales channels attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical and human medical diagnostics companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures some of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

 

  9 

 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to among other things product approvals manufacturing marketing and promotion recordkeeping testing quality storage and product disposal the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

veterinary diagnostic products  most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our production animal products and our rapid assay lines of business are veterinary biological products for infectious diseases that are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the united states department of agriculture “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and our distribution center in memphis tennessee 

our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the fda and does not subject us to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations “cgmp” these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the fdc act 

these products also are subject to the european medical device directives which create a single set of medical device regulations for all european union “eu” member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in eu member countries to obtain european conformity “ce” marking for their products 

veterinary pharmaceuticals  the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by the center for veterinary medicine “cvm” of the fda a new animal drug may not be commercially marketed in the us unless it has been approved as safe and effective by cvm approval may be requested by filing a new animal drug application “nada” with cvm containing substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug data regarding manufacturing methods and controls also are required to be submitted with the nada manufacturers of animal drugs must also comply with cgmp and good laboratory practices “glp” sales of animal drugs in countries outside the us require compliance with the laws of those countries which may be extensive 

  10 

water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the us that is required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ®  quantitray ®  filtamax ® and simplate ® for heterotropic plate counts “hpc” products have been approved by the epa the sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world 

dairy testing products  the sale of dairy testing products in the us is regulated by the fda in conjunction with the aoac research institute “aoac ri” before a product can be sold extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the fda and the aoac ri following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by the national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the fda and ncims while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

human pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers  our opti ® instrument systems are classified as class ii medical devices and their design manufacture and marketing are regulated by the fda accordingly we must comply with cgmp in the manufacture of our opti ® products the fda’s quality system regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the fda new opti ® products fall into fda classifications that require notification of and review by the fda before marketing submitted as a 510k application 

opti ® products are also subject to the european medical device directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food drug medical device and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we had approximately 4700 fulltime and parttime employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

we may be unsuccessful in maintaining our growth rate 

our ability to maintain our growth rate depends on our successful implementation of various strategies including 

 

  11 

 

however we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability 

our dependence on a limited number of suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or reduce our profitability 

we currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources these products include our vetautoread™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte and idexx vetlab ® ua™ urinalysis coagdx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories the consumables associated with our vettest ® chemistry analyzers image capture plates used in our digital radiography system active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components and raw materials used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future we could face cost increases or reductions or delays or discontinuations in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture which could negatively affect our ability to supply the market 

many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be required to discontinue sales of one of our veterinary pharmaceutical products 

for the year ended december 31 2007 2 of cag revenue or 154 million was attributable to sales of our highestselling pharmaceutical product this product is sold under the fda’s regulatory discretion and we believe that the fda would require us to discontinue sales of the product within a short period if and when the fda approves another product to treat the same condition whether such new product was our product or that of another commercial supplier in addition we have a finite inventory of the raw materials used in the manufacture of this product and these raw materials are no longer commercially available we believe that our remaining inventory of raw materials will be adequate to satisfy existing market demand until late 2008 or early 2009 we are seeking fda approval of a new product for the same application based on different raw materials fda approval of this new product would mitigate the commercial risk that we would be required to stop selling our current product due either to fda approval of another manufacturer’s product or to the full depletion of our inventory of raw materials while we hope to transition smoothly to our new product we cannot predict when or if the fda will approve our new product or any product that treats the same condition from another manufacturer further there can be no assurances that the new product would achieve the same revenue and profitability as our existing product 

  12 

various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to market and sell our products 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda the fda and the epa most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale in the us our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our opti ® line of human pointofcare electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the fda and require approval by the fda before they may be sold commercially in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights in this regard we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with sales of our snap ® fivfelv tests are likely to decline following the expiration in june 2009 of a us patent that we exclusively license that broadly covers products that diagnose feline immunodeficiency virus 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

distributor purchasing patterns could negatively affect our operating results 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the enduser demand for our products in addition our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any reason on 60 days notice because significant product sales are made to a limited number of distributors the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency timing or size of distributor purchases could have a negative effect on our results of operations our financial performance therefore is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph 

increased competition and technological advances by our competitors could negatively affect our operating results 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies competitors may develop products that that are superior to our products and as a result we may lose existing customers and market share some of our competitors and potential competitors including large human pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies have substantially greater financial resources than us and greater experience in manufacturing marketing research and development obtaining regulatory approvals and conducting clinical trials than we do

changes in testing could negatively affect our operating results 

the market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our production animal products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence in addition changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing such as our dairy and water products declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

on december 29 2006 the drinking water inspectorate in the uk published a proposal to discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for cryptosporidium  subsequently regulatory changes were approved and will become effective january 1 2009 beginning in 2009 we believe that we may lose a substantial portion of our sales of filtamax ® products in england and wales which were 28 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

consolidation of veterinary hospitals could negatively affect our business 

an increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the us are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals andor opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally major corporate hospital owners in the us include vca antech inc and banfield the pet hospital both of which are currently customers of idexx a similar trend is developing in the uk and may in the future also develop in other countries corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers which could have a negative impact on our results in addition certain corporate owners most notably vca antech our primary competitor in the us market for reference laboratory services also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals any hospitals acquired by these companies are likely to use their laboratory services almost exclusively in addition because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services business hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services 

our inexperience in the human pointofcare market could inhibit our success in this market 

upon acquiring the critical care division of osmetech plc in january 2007 we entered the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the opti ® line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market significant differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing more extensive regulation greater product liability risks larger competitors a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation our inexperience in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human pointofcare medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market

risks associated with doing business internationally could negatively affect our operating results 

for the year ended december 31 2007 40 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period in addition many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured sourced or both in the us and our costs are incurred in us dollars we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure however an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins 

the loss of our president chief executive officer and chairman could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w ayers our president chief executive officer and chairman we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr ayers the loss of mr ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if it occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

if our quarterly results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches operating expenditures litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

future operating results could be negatively affected by the resolution of various uncertain tax positions and by potential changes to tax incentives 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on june 30 2006 cyntegra inc filed suit against us in the us district court for the central district of california alleging that we had violated us federal antitrust laws and california state unfair trade practices laws the complaint alleged among other things that we were monopolizing the us market for companion animal diagnostic products on october 26 2007 the court granted summary judgment in our favor on all of cyntegra’s claims and dismissed the suit cyntegra has appealed this decision we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously as we believe cyntegra’s claims are without merit

 item 7   management’s discussion and analyses of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

during 2007 we operated primarily through three business segments products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as our companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for production animal health which we refer to as the production animal segment “pas” we also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality which we refer to as dairy and products for the human medical diagnostic market which we refer to as opti medical financial information about the dairy and opti medical operating segments are combined and presented in an “other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments we added the opti medical operating segment in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the critical care division of osmetech plc in january 2007 the segment information for the year ended december 31 2005 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 previously pas and dairy were aggregated into a single reportable segment which we referred to as the food diagnostics group see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2007 included in this annual report on form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

cag develops designs manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians water develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water pas develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect diseases in production animals dairy develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in dairy products opti medical develops designs manufactures and distributes pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market 

items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development expenses interest income and expense and income taxes sharebased compensation expense was also reported in “unallocated amounts” in 2006 beginning in 2007 we allocate a portion of sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company which was categorized as “unallocated amounts” 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group 

in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth and complementary nature of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution permits us to offer integrated diseasemanagement solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems including connecting the electronic health record with laboratory test data inclinic test data from our idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers and radiographic data in the idexxpacs™ software taken by our digital radiography systems 

in the us we sell instrument consumables rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products primarily through distributors and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors rather than sales to veterinarians the end users because distributors’ inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying enduser demand for the product therefore we closely track sales of these products by our us distributors to the veterinarians which we refer to as practicelevel sales we believe these sales often provide a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products 

instruments and consumables  our strategy in our idexx vetlab ® instrument business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments the principal instruments used by veterinarians for inclinic diagnostic testing are chemistry and hematology analyzers in addition we sell instruments used for endocrinology blood gas electrolytes urinalysis and blood coagulation testing our idexx vetlab ® station is an inclinic laboratory information management system that records and integrates patient diagnostic information from our analyzers for better practice management 

  23 

during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables and therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross margins in this line of business 

we have an installed base of approximately 30000 active vettest ® chemistry analyzers and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales although we continue to place instruments through sales lease rental and other programs our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

in the first quarter of 2008 we announced the launch of our nextgeneration chemistry analyzer catalyst dx™ as a result of this launch we expect that in 2008 we will derive a greater portion of our idexx vetlab ® revenues from the sale of instruments than we have derived in recent years 

we purchase the consumables used in our vettest ® and catalyst dx™ chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2025 this supply agreement provides us with a longterm source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010 and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume 

our principal hematology analyzer is the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and in addition we sell the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread™ hematology analyzers although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables lasercyte ® consumable sales have been partly offset by declines in sales of vetautoread™ consumables because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte ® consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the vetautoread™ consumables gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ease of use ability to handle compromised samples time to result analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® station education and training and superior sales and customer service our instruments and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies premium pricing 

rapid assay products  our rapid assay business consists primarily of singleuse kits for pointofcare testing and to a limited degree microwellbased kits for laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests through superior performance including by providing our customers with proprietary combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes where alternative pointofcare offerings exist we seek to differentiate our tests with superior performance as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer service these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which we believe do not include a similar level of support we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  24 

veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service technology employed and specialized test menu revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories in 2005 we acquired laboratories in switzerland the united kingdom and france and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us and germany in 2006 we acquired laboratories in the us south africa and canada and acquired a veterinary laboratory customer list in the us in 2007 we acquired laboratories in the us and canada and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us switzerland and united kingdom profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several years while we implement operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 

practice information systems and digital radiography  these businesses consist of veterinary practice information systems including hardware and software and veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems our strategy in the practice information systems business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives we differentiate our software systems through enhanced functionality and ease of use our veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals the digital radiography systems also incorporate idexxpacs™ picture archiving and communication software developed by idexx that allows for image enhancement manipulation storage and retrieval and integration with the practice information software our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the companion animal group 

pharmaceutical products  we currently offer pharmaceutical products to regulate feline diabetes eradicate internal parasites and treat lameness in horses our pharmaceutical strategy is to develop and commercialize proprietary pharmaceutical products for the veterinary market we seek to differentiate our pharmaceutical products through ease of use which in turn enhances customers’ compliance with prescribed treatment programs our product development efforts are focused on applying superior and proprietary delivery technologies to existing pharmaceutical compounds 

water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of market penetration by competitors and increased competition international sales of water testing products represented 45 of total water product sales in 2007 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

  25 

production animal segment 

we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry cattle and swine diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can be subject to fluctuation in 2007 approximately 83 of our sales in this business were international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business internationally 

other 

dairy  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverage almost exclusively the snap ® platform as well as the production equipment and lines of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection to successfully increase sales of dairy testing products we believe that we need to increase penetration in geographies outside the us and in the farm segment of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions 

opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the human market is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use menu convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

opti medical systems is also the supplier including development and manufacturing of our vetstat ® analyzer an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the idexx vetlab for the veterinary market in addition opti medical systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of catalyst dx™ our strategy in the opti medical systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s knowhow intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat ® analyzer and catalyst dx™ platforms for veterinary applications 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2007 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change 

  26 

revenue recognition 

customer programs  we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits or award points award points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us andor toward future purchases of our products or services we establish accruals for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and incentive offerings for each program based on numerous factors including 

 

revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits points earned but not yet issued and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current revenue in our analysis we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected inhouse that details the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic “practicelevel sales data” 

our two most significant customer programs are practice developer ® and snap ® up the savings tm “suts” both of which are offered only to north american customers for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded revenue reductions of 66 million 51 million and 48 million respectively related to our practice developer ® program and 43 million 49 million and 51 million respectively related to our suts program at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the accrued revenue reductions were 120 million 104 million and 71 million respectively for the practice developer ® program and 12 million 14 million and 14 million respectively for the suts program following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and incentive offerings for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005  in thousands

our practice developer ® program is a companion animal group awards program that permits customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly minimums in certain product and service categories including idexx reference laboratories services vettest ® slides vettest ® snapreader reagents lasercyte ® tubes feline and canine snap ® tests and service and maintenance agreements points may then be applied against the purchase price for idexx products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us suts is our volume incentive program for selected snap ® tests that provides customers with benefits in the form of 1 discounts off invoice at the time of purchase and 2 points under the practice developer ® program awarded quarterly throughout the suts program year which ends on august 31 based on total purchase volume of qualified snap ® products during the year 

for the practice developer program the accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter based on sales to end users during the quarter by either us or our distributors and on our estimate of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the quarter as points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to expire or breakage using historical forfeiture rates on november 30 of each year unused points granted before january 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate 

under the suts program commencing september 1 2007 customers receive a 5 rebate of their purchase price if they purchase a minimum volume of products either from us or our distributors we cannot be certain what percentage of customers will purchase the minimum volume of products until that program year has ended at the beginning of the program year we develop an estimate of the percentage of customers that we expect to meet the minimum purchase threshold over the program period based on program enrollee purchasing patterns historical experience with similar programs current sales trends and marketing analysis the percentage of customers expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold is adjusted quarterly during the program year based on our experience with the program and finalized when the program year ends in august the 5 revenue reduction is calculated quarterly based on the applicable gross sales during the period at enduser prices and the estimated percentage of end users that are expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold by the end of the program year the accrued revenue reduction also includes our estimate of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the quarter 

if the estimated percentage of customers expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold required to receive the 5 rebate under the suts program were to increase or decrease by 5 we would be required to further reduce revenue or increase revenue respectively by 01 million 

doubtful accounts receivable  we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances might be required account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the receivable will not be recovered writeoffs of customer accounts during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were 07 million 05 million and 04 million respectively 

inventory valuation 

we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand market conditions and remaining shelf life if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations certain major components of inventory for which we have made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below 

lasercyte ® hematology analyzer  at december 31 2007 and 2006 27 million and 17 million respectively of inventory associated with our lasercyte ® hematology instrument required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods which was net of 17 million and 09 million respectively of writedowns for inventory estimated to be obsolete we determined writedowns based on our estimate of the costs to rework inventory compared to replacement cost and the probability of success primarily based on historical experience we expect to fully realize our net investment in this inventory however if we are unsuccessful reworking this inventory if we revise our judgment of our ability to successfully rework inventory due to new experience in reworking this inventory or if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 

  28 

nitazoxanide  at december 31 2006 our inventories included 93 million of inventory associated with navigator ®  our nitazoxanide product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis this inventory consisted of 02 million of finished goods and 91 million of active ingredient and other raw materials we have an agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longerdated material during 2007 we recognized a writedown of nitazoxanide raw materials inventory of 91 million and a writeoff of a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ®  our analysis of the realizability of these assets was triggered upon our receipt of notice from the thirdparty contract manufacturer of finished goods that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009 because of the low production volume of navigator ®  we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms and therefore we would not be able to obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement accordingly we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions this inventory comprised 91 million of active ingredient and other raw materials for which we recognized a full writedown during 2007 at december 31 2007 this inventory net of reserves comprised less than 01 million of finished goods sales of navigator ® were 04 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

a significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or if applicable fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net assets over the purchase price collectively “fair value” of the acquired business if a market value is not readily available the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions which are assumptions that are not specific to idexx the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks appropriate discount rates and the useful lives of intangible assets when deemed appropriate by management we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” for impairment testing the fair values of the reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the cash flows used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time because our pharmaceutical business is still substantially in an investment stage the determination of the fair value of this business unit requires significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of the unit’s future cash flows including assumptions about the markets for our products and proprietary technologies the future success of research and development activities the attainment and timing of regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell new products the introduction and success of competitive products by other market participants and other business risks changes in forecast cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period however a 25 decrease in the current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge for any of our reporting units that include goodwill no impairments were identified as a result of the annual or eventdriven reviews during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 or 2005 

we assessed goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business for impairment at june 30 2007 due to the matters discussed above and the resulting nitazoxanide inventory writedown and prepaid royalty license impairment charge the goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business of 137 million was not impaired at june 30 2007 or subsequently when evaluated as part of the annual assessment 

  29 

we assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time no impairments were identified during the years ended december 31 2006 or 2005 

during 2007 we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ® paste we also recognized a related inventory writedown and the circumstances are described in the above discussion of critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in inventory valuation and in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions we determined that we would not realize our investment in prepaid royalties and therefore fully expensed this asset no other impairments were identified during the year ended december 31 2007 

sharebased compensation 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” on january 1 2006 beginning in 2006 we modified our sharebased employee compensation programs to shift from the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of restricted stock units and stock options along with employee stock purchase rights there were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options during 2007 or 2006 

in connection with the adoption of sfas no 123r we adopted the straightline method to prospectively expense sharebased awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 the gradedvesting or accelerated method has been used to calculate the expense for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 if the total fair value of sharebased compensation awards as well as other features that impact expense including forfeitures and capitalization of costs was consistent from yeartoyear in each of the last five years and through 2010 this change in expense method from gradedvesting to straightline expensing would yield decreasing annual expense through 2010 until awards granted prior to january 1 2006 were fully expensed however the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

the fair value of options restricted stock units deferred stock units with vesting conditions and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 totaled 182 million 119 million and 157 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2007 before consideration of estimated forfeitures was 242 million the weighted average remaining expense recognition period is approximately 20 years 

the weighted average valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant were as follows 

 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of an option the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2007 74 million would have increased or decreased by approximately 7 if the stock price volatility assumption were increased or decreased by 10 respectively the total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended december 31 2007 would have increased or decreased by 01 million if the stock price volatility assumption were increased or decreased by 10 respectively 

  30 

to develop the expected term assumption for 2007 and 2006 option awards we elected to use the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 which is based on vesting and contractual terms the application of the simplified method is allowable for options granted through december 31 2007 we will transition to developing expected term assumptions for future awards based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise longer expected term assumptions increase the fair value of option awards and therefore increase the expense recognized per award the total fair value of options awarded during the year ended december 31 2007 74 million would have increased by approximately 12 or decreased by approximately 9 if the expected term assumption were increased or decreased by one year respectively the total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended december 31 2007 would have increased by 02 million or decreased by 01 million if the expected term assumption were increased or decreased by one year respectively 

sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results at december 31 2007 we applied annual forfeiture rates ranging from 4 to 16 to estimate future forfeitures of previously granted options and restricted stock units that had vesting dates after december 31 2007 net sharebased compensation costs for the year ended december 31 2007 were 86 million which is net of a reduction of 20 million for estimated forfeitures changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment by certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and therefore on sharebased compensation expense 

income taxes 

we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 

the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards net of valuation allowances was 154 million and 129 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made a reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5 of revenue compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended december 31 2007 would not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in one subsidiary where a 5 reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of 07 million for that subsidiary 

for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made similarly a determination that a higher valuation allowance is required would decrease income in the period such determination was made 

  31 

our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged as appropriate to income in the period such determination was made for example an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated us state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by 05 million this increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted likewise a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated us state income tax rate would have the opposite effect 

we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we consider certain operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us the cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries was 1296 million at december 31 2007 no provision has been made for us federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate these earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made for the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the united states we have accrued taxes on a current basis 

estimates for certain contingencies 

under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for us employees since january 1 2003 we have retained the first 250000 in claim liability per incident and aggregate claim liability based on payroll for each year the insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims claims incurred during the year ended december 31 2007 and year ended december 31 2006 are relatively new and significant additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims our liability for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 could exceed our estimates and we could be liable for up to 25 million and 10 million respectively in excess of the expense we have recognized for the three years ended on or prior to december 31 2005 based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability our maximum liability at december 31 2007 is 04 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized

results of operations 

twelve months ended december 31 2007 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2006 

revenue 

total company revenue increased 1834 million or 25 to 9226 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 7391 million for the prior year incremental sales from businesses and from customerrelated and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 contributed 8 to revenue growth these acquisitions consisted primarily of veterinary reference laboratories and customerrelated assets in canada the united states europe and south africa intellectual property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business a production animal diagnostic products business in france and the critical care division of osmetech plc the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 3 to revenue growth the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

 

 

 

companion animal group revenue for cag increased 1461 million or 24 to 7525 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 6063 million for the prior year incremental sales from veterinary reference laboratory businesses and customerrelated assets and from intellectual property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 contributed 6 to cag revenue growth the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 3 to the increase in cag revenue the following table presents revenue by product and service category for cag 

 

 

 

  33 

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us and net of incremental sales from businesses and from customerrelated and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 

because our instrument consumables rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products are sold in the us and certain other geographies by distributors distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices who are the end users distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying enduser demand for our products as a result fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to higher unit sales volume higher consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide practicelevel sales of slides and to a lesser extent to increased practicelevel sales of tubes used with our hematology analyzers with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued growth of our installed base of instruments sales volumes of consumables also benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in midmarch 2007 in the us and canada we believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual number of pet visits to veterinary clinics in north america in the first and second quarters of 2007 higher instrument sales revenue resulted mainly from increased sales of our lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and to a lesser extent our idexx vetlab ® station an inclinic laboratory information management system the impact from changes in us distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by less than 1 

the increase in practicelevel sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average unit sales prices and higher sales volumes higher average unit sales prices were due in part to higher relative sales of canine combination test products such as the snap ® 4dx ®  which was launched in the us in september 2006 and less promotional discounting in connection with our snap ® up the savings™ and other customer programs we expect the rate of end users’ conversion from canine heartwormonly tests to combination test products and therefore the rate of increase of average unit sales prices will lessen in future periods higher sales volumes resulted in part from the july 2007 launch of the snap ® cpl™ our test for pancreatitis in dogs effective january 2008 we changed our distribution methods in japan from a combination of direct sales and the use of multiple distributors to an exclusive distribution arrangement for our rapid assay products and instrument consumables the impact from the distributor’s initial stocking orders to build inventory levels increased reported revenue growth by 1 the impact from changes in us distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 4 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from higher testing volume and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases higher testing volume was attributable to both new customers and to increased testing volume from existing customers and benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the march 2007 pet food recall as discussed above and from new test offerings 

the increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal and equine radiography systems higher sales of cornerstone ® practice information management systems and services and the favorable impact of implementing tiered support service level offerings with differentiated pricing for our practice information management systems partly offset by lower average unit prices for radiography systems due to increased competition 

  34 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from higher sales volume and price increases in each case related largely to pzi vet ®  our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats 

water revenue for water increased 78 million or 13 to 662 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 585 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to both higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices and greater price competition in certain geographies higher sales volumes resulted in part from our commencement in september 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” which increased reported water revenue growth by 2 the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 4 to the increase in water revenue 

production animal segment revenue for pas increased 161 million or 27 to 751 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 589 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales volume including sales attributable to institut pourquier a manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products in france that we acquired in march 2007 sales of pourquier products contributed 12 to pas revenue growth the favorable impact of higher sales volume was partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for our herdchek ® products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies “tses” due to both greater price competition and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 7 to the increase in pas revenue 

other revenue for other operating units increased 134 million or 87 to 288 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 154 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental revenue attributable to opti medical which was acquired in january 2007 

gross profit 

total company gross profit increased 840 million or 22 to 4635 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 3795 million for the prior year as a percentage of total revenue gross profit decreased to 50 from 51 

during 2007 we recognized a writedown of nitazoxanide raw materials inventory of 91 million and a writeoff of a prepaid royalty license of 10 million associated with navigator ®  which resulted in an unfavorable impact of 11 of total company gross profit for the year ended december 31 2007 these writedowns are included in cost of product revenue in the consolidated statement of operations our analysis of the realizability of these assets was triggered upon our receipt of notice from the thirdparty contract manufacturer of finished goods that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009 because of the low production volume of navigator ®  we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms and therefore we would not be able to obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement accordingly we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions 

sharebased compensation expense of 07 million was included in cost of revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 11 million for the prior year beginning in 2007 we allocate sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments based on headcount and other personnel data this allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated sharebased compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company which was categorized as “unallocated amounts” sharebased compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments in 2006 therefore the total company sharebased compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year ended december 31 2006 

  35 

the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by operating segment 

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 652 million or 22 to 3632 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 2980 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product and service lines partly offset by a decrease in gross profit percentage to 48 from 49 the writedown of pharmaceutical inventory and the related prepaid royalty impairment charge discussed above resulted in an unfavorable impact of 14 of cag revenue greater relative sales of lower margin products and services such as laboratory and consulting services and idexx vetlab ® instruments also contributed to the decrease in the gross profit percentage these unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of our canine combination test product snap ® 4dx ® and to a lesser extent all other cag product and service lines except in the digital radiography business lower cost of slides that are sold for use in vettest ® chemistry analyzers and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

water gross profit for water increased 32 million or 8 to 417 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 384 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 63 from 66 the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher manufacturing costs lower average unit sales prices and greater relative sales of lower margin products which was primarily due to the lower gross margin earned on certain water testing kits manufactured by invitrogen corporation “invitrogen” that we began distributing in september 2007 

production animal segment gross profit for pas increased 81 million or 21 to 467 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 387 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62 from 66 the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by lower average unit sales prices net higher production costs the effect of purchase accounting for inventory acquired in connection with the pourquier business acquisition and a relatively lower gross profit rate realized on sales by pourquier largely offset by greater relative sales of higher margin products exclusive of the impact of the pourquier business the gross profit percentage earned on sales by pourquier excluding the impact of purchase accounting was lower than our historical pas gross profit rate due to greater price competition in the primary markets served by pourquier additionally purchase accounting for inventory had an unfavorable impact of 08 of pas revenue because finished goods inventory acquired in connection with a business acquisition are assigned a fair value that exceeds replacement cost which results in a low gross margin on the sale of those finished goods by the acquirer additionally decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

other gross profit for other operating units increased 53 million or 86 to 114 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 61 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental revenue attributable to opti medical which resulted in incremental gross profit for the other operating units excluding the acquisition of opti medical the gross profit percentage was 38 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 40 for the prior year the decrease in the gross profit percentage was due to lower average unit sales prices for certain dairy products and higher manufacturing and distribution costs partly offset by the favorable impact of the effect of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies 

  36 

operating expenses and operating income 

total company total operating expenses increased 757 million or 30 to 3273 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 2516 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating expenses increased to 35 from 34 

sharebased compensation expense of 79 million was included in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 90 million for the prior year beginning in 2007 we allocate sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments as discussed above the total company sharebased compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year ended december 31 2006 

operating income increased 83 million or 6 to 1362 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 1279 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased to 15 from 17 

the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment 

 

 

companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 646 million or 33 to 2619 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 1972 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 35 from 33 sharebased compensation expense of 60 million or 08 of revenue was included in cag operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded worldwide sales marketing and customer service support resources and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance additionally the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense and incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense 

  37 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded resources and spending on information technology facilities and other general support functions to a lesser extent the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to january 1 2006 comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense 

the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product development spending including additional professional resources related primarily to idexx vetlab ® instrumentation and rapid assay products to a lesser extent product development activities in all other cag product and service categories and the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense also contributed to the increases in research and development expense 

water operating expenses for water increased 21 million or 17 to 148 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 127 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue were approximately constant at 22 sharebased compensation expense of 04 million or 06 of revenue was included in water operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 the following table presents water expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded headcount and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense and higher spending on information technology facilities and other general support functions partly offset by the favorable comparison due to costs incurred during the third quarter of 2006 to consolidate our office and production facilities based in the united kingdom into a single facility and other net cost reductions the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher costs associated with coliform and e coli water test product development 

production animal segment operating expenses for pas increased 88 million or 39 to 313 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 225 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 42 from 38 sharebased compensation expense of 08 million or 10 of revenue was included in pas operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 the following table presents pas operating expenses by functional area 

 

  38 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from incremental activities associated with the pourquier business higher personnelrelated costs and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from incremental expenses associated with the pourquier business comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets and higher spending on information technology facilities and other general support functions to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense these increases were partly offset by a favorable comparison due to the writeoff in the second quarter of 2006 of certain fixed assets located in our facility in china the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher development activities and associated higher personnelrelated costs including incremental development activities attributable to the pourquier business acquired in march 2007 and to a lesser extent the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense 

other operating expenses for other operating units increased 72 million to 115 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 43 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental expenses attributable to opti medical which was acquired in january 2007 these costs are mainly composed of operating expenses of a recurring nature to support the opti medical business and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired sharebased compensation expense of 03 million or 10 of revenue was included in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2007 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments decreased 70 million to 79 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 149 million for the prior year as described above sharebased compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments in 2006 therefore total company sharebased compensation expense included in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 of 90 million was categorized as “unallocated amounts” beginning in 2007 we allocate a portion of sharebased compensation expense to the operating segments the unallocated sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2007 was 05 million corporate research and development expense was also included in “unallocated amounts” for both periods and grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2007 to support increased longterm product development activities 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income was 28 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 33 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in interest income was due primarily to lower invested cash balances partly offset by higher effective interest rates 

interest expense was 42 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 05 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in interest expense was due primarily to interest expense incurred on borrowings under a revolving credit facility 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 303 for the year ended december 31 2007 and 284 for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several nonrecurring items that benefited the tax rate in the year ended december 31 2006 these 2006 items included the resolution of an income tax audit for years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 a reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain multiyear tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability offsetting the impact of the items occurring in 2006 were several favorable impacts to our rate that occurred during the year ended december 31 2007 these items included an increase in certain federal tax incentives due to changes in legislation tax benefits related to reductions in international rates and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an audit 

  39 

we anticipate recognizing approximately 05 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at december 31 2007 in accordance with fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” the income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statute of limitations for various foreign and state tax jurisdictions 

twelve months ended december 31 2006 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2005 

revenue 

total company revenue increased 1010 million or 16 to 7391 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 6381 million for the prior year the following table presents revenue by reportable operating segment 

 

 

 

companion animal group revenue for cag increased 855 million or 16 to 6063 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 5208 million for the prior year incremental sales from businesses acquired since january 1 2005 consisting primarily of veterinary reference laboratories a digital radiography business and intellectual property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business contributed 2 to cag revenue growth the following table presents revenue by product and service categories for cag 

 

 

 

  40 

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to higher unit sales volume of both instruments and of consumables and to a lesser extent to higher average unit sales prices for slides that are sold for use in vettest ® chemistry analyzers higher consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide practicelevel sales of slides and to a lesser extent to increased us practicelevel sales of tubes used with our hematology analyzers with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued growth of our installed base of instruments higher instrument sales volume resulted mainly from sales of vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and to a lesser extent lasercyte ® hematology analyzers and snap ® readers the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels had no significant impact on reported revenue growth of instruments and consumables 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products was due primarily to increased sales volume of canine products including sales of snap ® 4dx ®  which was launched in the us in september 2006 the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported rapid assay revenue growth by 3 to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices of canine products in part due to less promotional discounting and higher relative sales of combination test products also contributed to rapid assay revenue growth these increases were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices of feline products partly due to greater promotional discounting incremental sales of rapid assay products for which we acquired distribution rights in the second quarter of 2006 contributed 2 to rapid assay revenue growth 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from higher testing volume and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases and incremental sales attributable to acquisitions between january 1 2005 and december 31 2006 businesses acquired since january 1 2005 contributed 4 to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth 

the increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography resulted primarily from an increase in the number of digital radiography systems sold digital radiography sales volume growth was due primarily to sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 which contributed 12 to practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue growth higher sales volumes of existing products and sales of the idexxdr™ 1417 digital radiography system which became commercially available during the third quarter of 2006 to a lesser extent revenue growth was also due to the impact of price increases for support services for our practice information management systems higher sales of computer hardware to practice information management systems customers and a shift in sales mix to larger practice information management systems 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from increased practicelevel demand and to a lesser extent from price increases both impacts related largely to pzi vet ®  our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats 

water revenue for water increased 17 million or 3 to 585 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 568 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume in the americas and europe and to a lesser extent to higher average unit sales prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of 05 million or 1 to the increase in water revenue 

production animal segment revenue for pas increased 140 million or 31 to 589 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 449 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide livestock diagnostics sales volume including notably sales in europe of our herdchek ® products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies to a lesser extent increased average unit sales prices in certain geographies higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at higher unit prices and higher poultry diagnostics sales volume in the americas also contributed to production animal products revenue growth the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of 04 million or 1 to the increase in pas revenue

gross profit 

total company gross profit increased 566 million or 18 to 3795 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 3229 million for the prior year as a percentage of total revenue gross profit was approximately constant at 51 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r and began expensing sharebased compensation beginning on january 1 2006 which had a negative impact on our gross profit percentages and on operating margins  for the year ended december 31 2006 sharebased compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized as “unallocated amounts” the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by reportable segment 

 

companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 476 million or 19 to 2980 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 2504 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to a lesser extent to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 49 from 48 for the prior year the increase in the gross profit percentage was largely due to lower cost of slides that are sold for use in vettest ® chemistry analyzers under the agreement with our supplier and higher average selling prices the increase in the gross profit percentage was partly offset by greater relative sales of lower margin products and services such as laboratory and consulting services 

water gross profit for water increased 02 million to 384 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 383 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 67 the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by increased freight and distribution costs and higher relative sales of lower margin products 

production animal segment gross profit for pas increased 109 million or 39 to 387 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 278 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume and to a lesser extent to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 62 the gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred in 2005 and higher average unit sales prices discrete costs in 2005 comprised integration costs and the impacts of purchase accounting that were associated with an acquisition in december 2004 

operating expenses and operating income 

total company total operating expenses increased 440 million to 2516 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 2076 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating expenses increased to 34 from 33 for the prior year the change in accounting for sharebased compensation beginning january 1 2006 resulted in an increase of 90 million or 4 in total company operating expenses for 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 sharebased compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized as “unallocated amounts” 

operating income increased 126 million to 1279 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 1153 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased to 17 from 18 the change in accounting for sharebased compensation beginning january 1 2006 had a negative impact of 1 on reported operating income as a percentage of total company revenue

the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by reportable segment 

 

companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 298 million or 18 to 1972 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 1674 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 33 from 32 the following table presents cag operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded worldwide sales marketing and customer service headcount and to higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance to a lesser extent incremental activities associated with businesses acquired since january 1 2005 also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities information technology and other general support functions to a lesser extent incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired since january 1 2005 comprised mainly of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense increases in general and administrative expenses were partly offset by the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005 

the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product development spending related primarily to idexx vetlab ® instrumentation and to a lesser extent rapid assay and digital radiography products 

  43 

water operating expenses for water increased 04 million or 3 to 127 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 123 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue were constant at 22 the following table presents water operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities information technology and other general support functions higher bad debt expense higher compensation and costs incurred to consolidate our office and production facilities based in the united kingdom into a single facility the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs the decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from lower spending following the launch of the idexx filtamax xpress ™ system a cryptosporidium and giardia testing product in the second quarter of 2006 

production animal segment operating expenses for pas increased 20 million or 10 to 225 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 205 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue pas operating expenses decreased to 38 from 46 the following table presents pas operating expenses by functional area 

 

the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities information technology and other general support functions and to a lesser extent from a writedown of an equity investment in a technology licensor increases in general and administrative expenses were partly offset by the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred in 2005 and the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005 discrete costs in 2005 were associated with the cessation of production in our swedenbased facility in connection with the centralization of our european production animal diagnostics operations in bern switzerland the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs increases in research and development expense from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded headcount and from higher patentrelated costs were substantially offset by lower facilities and overhead costs in europe as a result of the consolidation of our european production animal business including research and development activities during the second half of 2005 

unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments consisting primarily of the companywide sharebased compensation expense and corporate research and development increased 114 million to 149 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 35 million for the prior year this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense of 90 million in 2006 due to the adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 corporate research and development expense grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2005 and 2006 to support increased longterm product development activities 

  44 

interest income and interest expense 

interest income was 33 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase in interest income from higher interest rates was largely offset by lower average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 05 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest expense incurred on the mortgage assumed in connection with the westbrook maine facility purchase in may 2006 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 284 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 342 for the year ended december 31 2005 the majority of this rate differential resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2006 of an irs income tax audit for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 as a result of completing this audit we reduced previously accrued taxes and recognized a tax benefit of 37 of income before tax other items that decreased our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 included a reduction of previously recorded international deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain multiyear tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability in addition the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2006 was less than the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2005 due to the incremental tax expense in 2005 on the repatriation of 300 million pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004  these rate reductions were partly offset by the nonrecognition in 2006 of tax benefits on compensation expense for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase rights that were recorded in accordance with sfas no 123r effective january 1 2006 

recent accounting pronouncements 

a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 2r to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2007 included in this annual report on form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we had 604 million and 967 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments and working capital of 823 million and 1775 million respectively additionally at december 31 2007 we had borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility of 528 million we believe that current cash and cash equivalents funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs we further believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at customary interest rates to fund our growth objectives in february 2008 we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility to 2000 million the extent and timing of acquisitionsrelated spending and repurchases of our common stock could cause variations in our liquidity and leverage levels 

we consider certain operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences subject to this policy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

  45 

the following table presents additional key information concerning working capital 

 

sources and uses of cash 

cash generated by operating activities was 1351 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 1098 million for the same period in 2006 the total of net income and net noncash charges was 1361 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 1200 million for the same period in 2006 

we have historically experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and net positive cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period several factors contribute to the seasonal fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities including the following 

 

net income for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 03 million to 940 million from 937 million for the prior year income adjusted for noncash items and the tax benefit from exercises of stock options was 1454 million compared to 1294 million resulting in a yeartoyear increase of 160 million the changes in noncash adjustments are primarily due to the inclusion in net income for the year ended december 31 2007 of the writedown of navigator ® inventory and the associated royalty license impairment of 101 million and the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the prior year of 112 million the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due in part to the increase in amortization expense recognized for acquired intangibles assets of 37 million see notes 3 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets the navigator ® inventory writedown and intangible assets respectively 

during the year ended december 31 2007 cash decreased by 10 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to a decrease in the same period of 2006 of 102 million resulting in a yeartoyear change of 92 million the decrease in cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to 2006 was primarily attributable to 204 million less cash used by changes in inventory and an increase of 155 million of cash provided by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses partly offset by an increase of 190 million of cash used to fund increases in accounts receivable and 87 million used for other assets the decrease in cash used by inventory compared to the same period of 2006 was due in part to the receipt in the first quarter of 2006 of vettest ® slide inventory receipts from our supplier that were deferred from the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in an unusually large increase in vettest ® slide inventory during the year ended december 31 2006 

  46 

additionally during 2007 certain inventory levels that grew during the later part of 2006 subsequently decreased due to consumption and sales these inventory levels had increased during the second half of 2006 in preparation for a supplier’s production facility transition and to ensure adequate supply of certain instrument components and accessories that were being discontinued by the manufacturers the increase in cash provided by accounts payable and accrued expenses was due in part to higher development costs associated with new products that were launched during the first quarter of 2008 incremental receipts of vettest ® slide inventory near the end of 2007 incremental royalties payable due to higher revenue including revenue from businesses acquired during 2007 and higher deferred rent liabilities including real estate rental obligations associated with business acquisitions the increase in cash used to fund accounts receivable was due largely to higher sales during the three months and the year ended december 31 2007 

cash used by investing activities was 1211 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to cash used of 407 million for the same period of 2006 the increase in cash used by investing activities for 2007 compared to 2006 was largely due to 647 million of incremental cash used for business acquisitions and intangible assets which are described below and incremental purchases of property and equipment of 328 million these decreases in cash were partly offset by higher net proceeds from investments in 2007 of 43 million and the absence of expenditures on land and buildings in 2007 compared to 121 million during 2006 primarily for the purchase of our westbrook maine facility 

we paid 866 million and assumed liabilities including contingent liabilities and deferred tax liabilities associated with purchase accounting of 179 million to acquire businesses and certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended december 31 2007 we also paid 32 million in relation to businesses acquired in prior years in january 2007 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the critical care division of osmetech plc the acquired business is based in the united states and develops designs manufactures and distributes pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical and veterinary diagnostics markets in march 2007 we acquired all of the equity of vitatech canada inc “vitatech” and institut pourquier sas “pourquier” in separate transactions vitatech is the largest provider of reference laboratory testing services to veterinarians in canada and has operations in toronto and montreal canada pourquier is based in montpellier france and develops designs manufactures and distributes production animal diagnostic products in march and october 2007 we acquired veterinary reference laboratories located in the united states we also acquired certain assets of other veterinary reference laboratories during the year ended december 31 2007 that did not comprise businesses see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our acquisitions of businesses 

we paid 651 million to purchase fixed assets and 11 million to acquire rental instruments sold under recourse during the year ended december 31 2007 our total capital expenditures for 2007 included approximately 13 million towards the renovation and expansion of our primary facility in westbrook maine we preliminarily project additional capital spending of approximately 140 million during 2008 through 2011 to complete this project with 75 million of the projected spending during 2008 the first phase of this project will provide more efficient manufacturing and research and development facilities 

in january 2007 we entered into an unsecured shortterm revolving credit facility with a bank in the principal amount of 1250 million that would have matured on june 30 2007 on march 30 2007 we refinanced this shortterm facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility with four multinational banks that matures on march 30 2012 the “credit facility” in february 2008 we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility to 2000 million the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our common stock and business acquisitions the applicable interest rates generally range from 0375 to 0875 above the london interbank rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate dependent on our leverage ratio under the credit facility we pay quarterly commitment fees of 008 to 020 dependent on our leverage ratio on any unused commitment the credit facility contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants as well as customary events of default that would allow any amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be accelerated or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder in the event of noncompliance the financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as defined by the agreement not to exceed 3to1 at december 31 2007 we had 722 million outstanding under the credit facility 

  47 

the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions from the inception of the program in august 1999 to december 31 2007 we repurchased 33148000 shares we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our employee sharebased compensation programs repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information about our share repurchases

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate subsidiaries in 17 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize some natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions market gains and losses are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals as appropriate until the contract matures which is the period when the related obligation is settled we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 18 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases for the next year from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions 

our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended december 31 2007 we enter into currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other specific significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle at december 31 2007 we had 13 million in net unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 06 million in taxes 

our currency rate exposure at december 31 2007 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies based on our overall currency rate exposure excluding unrealized losses of 19 million at december 31 2007 and unrealized losses of 20 million at december 31 2006 on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges a 10 weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december 31 2007 would increase or decrease operating income respectively by approximately 34 million in 2008 and a 10 weakening or strengthening of the us dollar from december 31 2006 would have increased or decreased operating income respectively by approximately 31 million in 2007 at december 31 2007 a 10 weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would increase or reduce operating income respectively by approximately 157 million in 2008 compared to 139 million in 2007

 item 7 management’s discussion and analyses of financial condition and results of operations during 2006 we operated primarily through three business segments products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as our companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products for production animal health which we refer to as the production animal segment “pas” we also operate a smaller segment that comprises products for dairy quality which we refer to as dairy financial information about the dairy operating segment is presented in an “other” category as of january 2007 we have added an operating segment opti medical in connection with our acquisition of the critical care division of osmetech plc which is presented in an “other” category cag develops designs manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians water develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water pas develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect diseases in production animals dairy develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in dairy products opti medical develops manufactures and sells pointofcare electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market unallocated items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of sharebased compensation costs effective january 1 2006 corporate research and development expenses interest income and expense and income taxes the segment information for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2006 previously pas and dairy were aggregated into a single reportable segment which we referred to as the food diagnostics group see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 included in this form 10k for financial information about our segments including geographic information and about our product and service categories 

the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution permits us to offer integrated diseasemanagement solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems including connecting the electronic health record with laboratory test data inclinic test data from our idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers and radiographic data in the idexxpacs™ software taken by our digital radiography systems 

in the us we sell instrument consumables rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products primarily through distributors and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors rather than sales to veterinarians the end users because distributors’ inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying enduser demand for the product therefore we closely track sales of these products by our us distributors to the veterinarians “practicelevel sales” which we think provide a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products 

  instruments and consumables  our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and in doing so achieve their practice economic objectives including growth and profitability we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline 

we have a large installed base of vettest ® chemistry analyzers and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales although we continue to place instruments through sales lease rental and other programs our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

we purchase the consumables used in vettest ® chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2020 this supply agreement provides us with a longterm source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010 and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume under this agreement we are developing and expect to introduce a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer named catalyst dx™ for the veterinary market based primarily on the ortho dryslide technology and secondarily on opti ® electrolyte technology and ortho will supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest ® chemistry analyzer we plan to launch catalyst dx™ in january 2008 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we introduced the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread™ hematology analyzers although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables lasercyte ® consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of vetautoread™ consumables because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte ® consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the vetautoread™ consumables gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ease of use ability to handle compromised samples time to result analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® station education and training and superior sales and customer service our instruments and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends in part on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies premium pricing 

  rapid assay products  our rapid assay business consists primarily of singleuse kits for pointofcare testing and to a limited degree microwellbased kits for laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population we seek to differentiate our tests through superior performance including by providing our customers with proprietary combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes where alternative pointofcare offerings exist we seek to differentiate our tests with superior performance as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer service these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which we believe do not include a similar level of support we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing in 2008 we plan to introduce a new idexx vetlab ® analyzer snapshot dx ™  that later that year will include the capability to interpret the test results from all snap assays and log the tests and their results in the idexx vetlab ® station database and therefore in the medical and financial records of the practice 

  reference laboratory and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories in markets outside the us inclinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service technology employed and specialized test menu revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories in 2004 we acquired a laboratory in columbus ohio opened a laboratory in seattle washington and acquired vet med lab which is based in germany and is the largest european veterinary reference laboratory in 2005 we acquired laboratories in switzerland the united kingdom and france and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us and germany in 2006 we acquired laboratories in clearwater florida south africa and canada and acquired a veterinary laboratory customer list in the us profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several years while we implement operating improvements and efficiencies therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 

  practice information management systems and digital radiography  these businesses consist of veterinary practice information management systems “pims” including hardware and software and veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems our strategy in the pims business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives we differentiate our software systems through enhanced functionality and ease of use our veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals the digital radiography systems also incorporate idexxpacs™ picture archiving and communication software developed by idexx that allows for image enhancement manipulation storage and retrieval and integration with the practice information software our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the companion animal group 

  pharmaceutical products  we currently offer pharmaceutical products to regulate feline diabetes eradicate internal parasites and treat lameness in horses our pharmaceutical strategy is to develop register and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products for the veterinary market we seek to differentiate our pharmaceutical products through ease of use which in turn enhances customers’ compliance with prescribed treatment programs our product development efforts are focused on applying superior and proprietary delivery technologies to existing pharmaceutical compounds 

water our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of market penetration by competitors and increased competition international sales of water testing products represented 42 of total water product sales in 2006 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

production animal segment we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry cattle and swine diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can be subject to fluctuation in 2006 approximately 79 of our sales in this business were international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 

in 2004 we received usda approval of our postmortem test for bse mad cow disease and in february 2005 we were informed that this test was approved by the european commission for sale in eu member countries while bse testing is very limited in the us a larger market for bse testing exists in europe 

other   dairy  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance the manufacture of these testing products leverage almost exclusively the snap ® platform as well as the production equipment and lines of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection sales of dairy testing products have declined slightly over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market to increase sales of dairy testing products we look to increase penetration in geographies outside the us and in the farm segment of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions 

  opti medical systems  our strategy in the opti medical systems business is to develop manufacture and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical pointofcare diagnostics market worldwide with a focus on small to midsized hospitals we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use menu convenience international distribution and service and instrument reliability similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line are derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventory goodwill and other intangible assets sharebased compensation income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 included in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 

     certain diagnostic instruments and practice information management systems offered for sale may include software that is considered more than incidental to the utility and value of the product sales arrangements may provide for software update rights or postcontract customer support judgment is required to determine whether sales arrangements include multiple elements 

when multiple products andor services are sold together we generally allocate the total consideration received amongst the elements based on their relative fair values which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers when there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 

we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings which may give customers credits award points or tradein rights awards points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us andor toward future purchase of our products and services we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits points actually awarded and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue for the snap up the savings ™ program estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers for our practice developer™ volume discount program we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because the historical forfeitures have been de minimus on november 30 of each year unused points awarded before january 1 of the prior year expire 

we may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future for tradein rights we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average tradein value 

we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances might be required 

inventory valuation we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations certain major components of inventory for which we have made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below 

  lasercyte ® hematology analyzer  at december 31 2006 our net inventories included 115 million of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte ® hematology instrument in addition we had firm purchase commitments for an additional 42 million of component parts as of december 31 2006 at december 31 2006 17 million of the net lasercyte ® inventory required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods which was net of 09 million writedowns for inventory estimated to be obsolete we expect to fully realize our net investment in inventory and purchase commitments however if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 

  nitazoxanide  our nitazoxanide product navigator ®  for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis “epm” was approved by the fda in november 2003 at december 31 2006 our inventories included 93 million of inventory associated with navigator ®  consisting of 02 million of finished goods and 91 million of active ingredient and other raw materials we have an agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longerdated material we paid 09 million in january 2005 for consideration for this agreement and capitalized this payment as inventory cost we believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale however if actual market conditions or our market share through 2022 are less than we estimate we may be required to write off some of the associated inventory for example if we sell approximately 50 fewer units through 2025 than we estimate we would have approximately 5 million of excess inventory 

valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets a significant portion of the purchase prices of our business acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or if applicable fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net assets over cost collectively “fair value” when acquired if a market value is not readily available the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions the estimation of discounted cash flows requires significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows risks the cost of capital and the useful lives of intangible assets when the fair values of acquired intangible assets are significant we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices of acquisitions to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

        we continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value in determining expected future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups the cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” for impairment testing we identify our reporting units allocate assets and liabilities including goodwill to the reporting units and compare the reporting units’ net book value to their estimated fair value the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the cash flow estimates used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if a reporting unit’s net book value exceeds its fair value then the implied fair value of goodwill is determined if the net book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess no impairments have been identified as a result of the annual or eventdriven reviews during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 or 2004 

the determination of the fair value of our pharmaceutical products business unit requires significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of the unit’s future cash flows including assumptions about the markets for our products and proprietary technologies the future success of research and development activities the attainment and timing of regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell new products the introduction and success of competitive products by other market participants and other business risks we believe that the goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business of 137 million is not impaired at december 31 2006 however changes in our assumptions and estimates due to new information or actual results that are below expectations could result in an impairment in the future of some or all of the goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical products business 

sharebased compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” on january 1 2006 sfas no 123r requires all sharebased compensation to employees including grants of stock options to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the requisite service period generally the vesting period prior to january 1 2006 we measured costs related to employee sharebased compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb no 25” accordingly no employee compensation cost was recognized for these plans prior to january 1 2006 

effective january 1 2006 under the modified prospective method of transition sharebased compensation expense includes expense for unvested awards at december 31 2005 and all awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 sharebased compensation expense for the unvested awards outstanding at december 31 2005 is based on the grantdate fair value previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 

beginning in 2006 we modified our sharebased employee compensation programs to shift from the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of restricted stock units and stock options along with employee stock purchase rights there were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options during 2006 or 2005 

in connection with the adoption of sfas no 123r we adopted the straightline method to prospectively expense sharebased awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 the gradedvesting or accelerated method has been used to calculate the expense for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 if the total fair value of sharebased compensation awards as well as other features that impact expense including forfeitures and capitalization of costs was consistent from yeartoyear in each of the last five years and through 2010 this change in expense method from gradedvesting to straightline expensing would yield decreasing annual expense through 2010 until awards granted prior to january 1 2006 were fully expensed however the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors including our sharebased award practices therefore sharebased compensation expense is likely to fluctuate possibly significantly from year to year 

selected financial impacts of sharebased compensation excluding the impact of deferred stock units issued under our director deferred compensation plan or our executive deferred compensation plan that do not have vesting conditions which are described below are presented in the table below  in thousands except per share amounts  

 sharebased compensation costs are classified in costs of sales and operating expenses consistently with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such sharebased compensation capitalized sharebased employee compensation cost at december 31 2006 was 02 million which was included in inventory on the consolidated balance sheet 

the fair value of options restricted stock units deferred stock units with vesting conditions and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 totaled 119 million 157 million and 134 million respectively the total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested sharebased compensation awards outstanding at december 31 2006 net of estimated forfeitures was 146 million approximately 63 million is expected to be recognized in the year ending december 31 2007 for outstanding awards and decreasing amounts of the total expense are expected to be recognized over the subsequent five years resulting in a weighted average remaining expense recognition period of approximately 15 years 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model to determine the fair value of options granted optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of an option to develop the expected term assumption for 2006 option awards we elected to use the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 107 which is based on vesting and contractual terms the application of the simplified method is allowable for options granted through december 31 2007 we will transition to developing expected term assumptions for future awards based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regards to option exercise longer expected term assumptions increase the fair value of option awards and therefore increase the expense recognized per award 

the weighted average valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows 

 sharebased compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is therefore reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited the forfeiture estimate is based on historical data and other factors and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant unanticipated increases or decreases in sharebased compensation expense from period to period the termination of employment by certain employees who hold large numbers of sharebased compensation instruments may also have a significant unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and therefore on sharebased compensation expense 

the tax benefit related to the option fair value is recognized when disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options occur as either a reduction of the current period tax provision or an increase in additional paidin capital as required by sfas no 123r transitional accounting rules depending on the vesting status of awards at the sfas no 123r adoption date and the amounts previously expensed under sfas no 123r employees’ exercise of vested options and disposition of shares acquired is influenced by the market price of the common stock and other factors outside of our control the timing and volume of disqualifying dispositions the vesting status of such exercised options at the date of our adoption of sfas no 123r and the relationship between the sale price of the common stock the option exercise price and the option fair value may have a significant unpredictable impact on our effective tax rate as the aggregate fair value of outstanding options that has been expensed under sfas no 123r grows we expect to recognize increasing tax benefits in net income related to disqualifying dispositions however the growth of the aggregate fair value of outstanding options that has been expensed under sfas no 123r will be limited in future years as a result of changes implemented in 2006 in our sharebased compensation programs under which we have shifted from the grant of stock options only to the grant of a mix of stock options and restricted stock unit awards that have a lower aggregate fair value than was awarded in prior years reductions in the fair value of options outstanding are expected to reduce the variability in our effective tax rate 

income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we consider the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states the cumulative amount of which was 1114 million at december 31 2006 no provision has been made for united states federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate nonunited states earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made 

estimates for certain contingencies under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for us employees for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 2004 and 2003 we retain the first 250000 in claim liability per incident and 31 million 28 million 30 million and 14 million respectively in aggregate claim liability we entered into a similar workers’ compensation insurance policy effective january 1 2007 the insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims based on this analysis we have recognized cumulative expenses of 13 million 06 million 07 million and 08 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

under our employee health care insurance policy we retain claims liability risk up to 125000 per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month we estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage our claims experience the number of employees enrolled in the program and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported should actual employee health care claims liability exceed estimates we are liable for up to an additional 15 million for potential uninsured obligations at december 31 2006 we have insurance coverage of 10 million for claims above the aggregate limit should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage 

we are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business including with respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can reasonably be estimated however our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals 

results of operations twelve months ended december 31 2006 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2005 revenue   total company revenue increased 1010 million or 16 to 7391 million from 6381 million for the prior year the following table presents revenue by reportable operating segment 

     companion animal group revenue for cag increased 855 million or 16 to 6063 million from 5208 million for the prior year incremental sales from businesses acquired since january 2005 consisting primarily of veterinary reference laboratories a digital radiography business and intellectual property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business contributed 2 to cag revenue growth the following table presents revenue by product and service categories for cag 

   the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

because our instrument consumables rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products are sold in the us and certain other geographies by distributors distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices who are the end users distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying enduser demand for our products as a result fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period conversely if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year then distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables from 2005 to 2006 was due mainly to higher unit sales volume of both instruments and of consumables and to a lesser extent to higher average unit sales prices for slides that are sold for use in vettest ® chemistry analyzers higher consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide practicelevel sales of slides and to a lesser extent to increased us practicelevel sales of tubes used with our hematology analyzers with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued growth of our installed base of instruments higher instrument sales volume resulted mainly from sales of vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and to a lesser extent lasercyte ® hematology analyzers and snap ® readers the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels had no significant impact on reported revenue growth of instruments and consumables 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to increased sales volume of canine products including sales of snap ® 4dx ®  which was launched in the us in september 2006 the impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported rapid assay revenue growth by 3 to a lesser extent higher average unit sales prices of canine products in part due to less promotional discounting and higher relative sales of combination test products also contributed to rapid assay revenue growth these increases were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices of feline products partly due to greater promotional discounting incremental sales of rapid assay products for which we acquired distribution rights in the second quarter of 2006 contributed 2 to rapid assay revenue growth 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services from 2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from higher testing volume and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases and incremental sales attributable to acquisitions since january 2005 businesses acquired since january 2005 contributed 4 to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth 

the increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography from 2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of digital radiography systems sold digital radiography sales volume growth was due primarily to sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 which contributed 12 to practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue growth higher sales volumes of existing products and sales of the idexxdr™ 1417 digital radiography system which became commercially available during the third quarter of 2006 to a lesser extent revenue growth was also due to the impact of price increases for support services for our practice information management systems higher sales of computer hardware to practice information management systems customers and a shift in sales mix to larger practice information management systems 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products from 2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from increased practicelevel demand and to a lesser extent from price increases both impacts related largely to pzi vet ®  our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats 

  water revenue for water increased 17 million or 3 to 585 million from 568 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume in the americas and europe and to a lesser extent to higher average unit sales prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of 05 million or 1 to the increase in water revenue 

  production animal segment revenue for pas increased 140 million or 31 to 589 million from 449 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide livestock diagnostics sales volume including notably sales in europe of our herdchek ® products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies to a lesser extent increased average unit sales prices in certain geographies higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at higher unit prices and higher poultry diagnostics sales volume in the americas also contributed to production animal products revenue growth the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of 04 million or 1 to the increase in pas revenue 

gross profit   total company gross profit increased 566 million or 18 to 3795 million from 3229 million for the prior year as a percentage of total revenue gross profit was approximately constant at 51 

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r and began expensing sharebased compensation beginning on january 1 2006 which had a negative impact on our gross profit percentages and on operating margins  sharebased compensation expense is not allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized as “unallocated amounts” the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by reportable segment 

   companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 476 million or 19 to 2980 million from 2504 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to a lesser extent to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 49 from 48 for the prior year the increase in the gross profit percentage was largely due to lower cost of slides that are sold for use in vettest ® chemistry analyzers under the agreement with our supplier and higher average selling prices the increase in the gross profit percentage was partly offset by greater relative sales of lower margin products and services such as laboratory and consulting services 

  water gross profit for water increased 02 million to 384 million from 383 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 67 the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by increased freight and distribution costs and higher relative sales of lower margin products 

  production animal segment gross profit for pas increased 109 million or 39 to 387 million from 278 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume and to a lesser extent to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 66 from 62 the gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred in 2005 and higher average unit sales prices discrete costs in 2005 comprised integration costs and the impacts of purchase accounting that were associated with an acquisition in december 2004 

operating expenses and operating income   total company total operating expenses increased 440 million to 2516 million from 2076 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating expenses increased to 34 from 33 for the prior year the change in accounting for sharebased compensation beginning january 1 2006 resulted in an increase of 90 million or 4 in total company operating expenses for 2006 sharebased compensation expense is not allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized as “unallocated amounts” 

operating income increased 126 million to 1279 million from 1153 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased to 17 from 18 the change in accounting for sharebased compensation beginning january 1 2006 had a negative impact of 1 on reported operating income as a percentage of total company revenue 

the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by reportable segment 

    companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 298 million or 18 to 1972 million from 1674 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 33 from 32 the increase was attributable to a 13 113 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 20 101 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 28 84 million increase in research and development expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded worldwide sales marketing and customer service headcount and to higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance to a lesser extent incremental activities associated with businesses acquired since january 2005 also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities information technology and other general support functions to a lesser extent incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired since january 2005 comprised mainly of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the acquired businesses also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense increases in general and administrative expenses were partly offset by the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005 the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product development spending related primarily to idexx vetlab ® instrumentation and to a lesser extent rapid assay and digital radiography products 

  water operating expenses for water increased 04 million or 3 to 127 million from 123 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue were constant at 22 the increase was attributable to a 7 03 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 3 01 million increase in sales and marketing expense partly offset by 5 01 million decrease in research and development expense the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities information technology and other general support functions higher bad debt expense higher compensation and costs incurred to consolidate our office and production facilities based in the united kingdom into a single facility the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs the decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from lower spending following the launch of the idexx filtamax xpress ™ system a cryptosporidium and giardia testing product in the second quarter of 2006 

  production animal segment operating expenses for pas increased 20 million or 10 to 225 million from 205 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue pas operating expenses decreased to 38 from 46 the increase in operating expenses resulted primarily from a 14 11 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 12 09 million increase in sales and marketing expense the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities information technology and other general support functions and to a lesser extent from a writedown of an equity investment in a technology licensor increases in general and administrative expenses were partly offset by the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred in 2005 and the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005 discrete costs in 2005 were associated with the cessation of production in our swedenbased facility in connection with the centralization of our european production animal diagnostics operations in bern switzerland the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnelrelated costs increases in research and development expense from higher personnelrelated costs due in part to expanded headcount and from higher patentrelated costs were substantially offset by lower facilities and overhead costs in europe as a result of the consolidation of our european production animal business including research and development activities during the second half of 2005 

  unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments consisting primarily of the companywide sharebased compensation expense and corporate research and development increased 114 million to 149 million from 35 million for the prior year this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of sharebased compensation expense of 90 million in 2006 due to the adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 corporate research and development expense grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2005 and 2006 to support increased longterm product development activities 

interest income and interest expense interest income was 33 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase in interest income from higher interest rates was largely offset by lower average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 05 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to interest expense incurred on the mortgage assumed in connection with the westbrook maine facility purchase in may 2006 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 284 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 342 for the year ended december 31 2005 the majority of this rate differential resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2006 of an irs income tax audit for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 as a result of completing this audit we reduced previously accrued taxes and recognized a tax benefit of 37 of income before tax other items that decreased our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 included a reduction of previously recorded international deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain multiyear tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability in addition the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2006 was less than the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2005 due to the incremental tax expense in 2005 on the repatriation of 300 million pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004  these rate reductions were partly offset by the nonrecognition in 2006 of tax benefits on compensation expense for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase rights that were recorded in accordance with sfas no 123r effective january 1 2006 

twelve months ended december 31 2005 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2004 revenue   total company revenue increased 889 million or 16 to 6381 million from 5492 million for the prior year the following table presents revenue by reportable segment 

     companion animal group revenue for cag increased 721 million or 16 to 5208 million from 4487 million for the prior year incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 and 2005 consisting of veterinary reference laboratories and a digital radiography business contributed approximately 7 to cag revenue growth during the period the following table presents revenue by product and service categories for cag 

   the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables from 2004 to 2005 was due mainly to increased sales volume the increased sales volume of consumables was due primarily to higher worldwide practicelevel sales of vettest ® slides to a lesser extent increased domestic sales of consumables used with our vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzers and higher practicelevel sales of tubes used with our hematology instruments also resulted in increased sales volume of consumables increased vettest ® chemistry and hematology consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments throughout 2004 and 2005 the increase in sales of vetlyte ® consumables was due in part to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to product unavailability which had a favorable impact of 1 on the growth rate for instruments and consumables during 2005 increased instrument sales volume resulted mainly from higher sales of lasercyte ® hematology analyzers and to a lesser extent the launch of our vetstat ® electrolyte and blood gas analyzer 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to increased domestic practicelevel sales volume of our canine combination test the snap ® 3dx ® canine test and to higher average unit sales prices for canine and feline products 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services from 2004 to 2005 resulted primarily from the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases and higher testing volume incremental sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 contributed approximately 23 to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth during 2005 

the increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems from 2004 to 2005 resulted from increased sales volume of digital radiography instruments the increase in digital radiography revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold including sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 incremental sales from this acquired business contributed approximately 7 to practice information management and digital radiography systems revenue growth during 2005 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products in 2005 resulted primarily from increased practicelevel demand and to a lesser extent from price increases on certain products 

  water revenue for water increased 37 million or 7 to 568 million from 531 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices attributable to both greater price competition in certain geographies and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of 02 million or less than 1 to the increase in water revenue 

  production animal segment revenue for pas increased 133 million or 42 to 449 million from 317 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume of livestock and to a lesser extent poultry diagnostics including sales attributable to acquisitions in 2004 incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 17 to production animal products revenue growth during the period changes in foreign currency rates did not have a significant impact on the pas revenue growth rate 

gross profit   total company gross profit increased 439 million or 16 to 3229 million from 2790 million for the prior year and as a percentage of total revenue was approximately constant at 51 the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by reportable segment 

 36 

  companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 355 million or 17 to 2504 million from 2149 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product lines as a percentage of revenue cag gross profit was approximately constant at 48 the gross profit percentage was positively impacted by relatively higher selling prices particularly for laboratory and consulting services and rapid assay products lower product and service costs associated with the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and lower product cost of slides sold for use in our vettest ® chemistry analyzers under the agreement with our supplier and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses the increases in the gross profit percentage were largely offset by higher overall net product and service costs apart from the favorable lasercyte ® and slide costs mentioned above greater relative sales of lower margin products and services mainly from higher sales growth of laboratory services and writedowns of excess pharmaceutical product inventory 

  water gross profit for water increased 24 million or 7 to 383 million from 359 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume partly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage to 67 from 68 the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by costs related to a manufacturing issue during the third quarter of 2005 and by lower average unit sales prices these decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

  production animal segment gross profit for pas increased 66 million or 31 to 278 million from 212 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62 from 67 during the same period of the prior year a reduction of approximately 18 million in an estimated liability for a third party claim was accounted for as a reduction in cost of revenue and increased the 2004 gross profit percentage by four percentage points for 2005 an unfavorable impact on the gross margin percentage of two percentage points was attributable to incremental acquisition integration costs the gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products and by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses partially offset by higher net product costs 

operating expenses and operating income   total company total operating expenses increased 366 million to 2076 million from 1710 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating expenses increased to 33 from 31 for the prior year 

operating income increased 73 million to 1153 million from 1080 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased to 18 from 20 during 2005 operating income was reduced by acquisition integration costs associated with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 including costs incurred in connection with the centralization of our european production animal diagnostics operations in bern switzerland during 2004 operating income benefited from the settlement of a third party claim described in the above discussion of production animal segment gross profit and a payment received in settlement of litigation partly offset by acquisition integration costs these discrete items in both years resulted in a reported decrease in operating income as a percentage of total company revenue of one percentage point the remaining difference in the operating income percentage for 2005 compared to the prior year was attributable in part to the expansion of the cag sales customer service and marketing organization during 2004 and the first half of 2005 amortization expense for intangible assets purchased in connection with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 and other changes in gross profit and operating expenses described in this discussion 

the following tables present operating expenses and operating income by reportable segment 

 37 

   companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 296 million or 22 to 1674 million from 1378 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 32 from 31 the increase was attributable to a 21 151 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 25 101 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 17 44 million increase in research and development expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the expansion of the worldwide sales customer service and marketing organization ongoing expenses attributable to the vet med lab business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and to a lesser extent the digital radiography business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses attributable to businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 comprised of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and integration costs to a lesser extent the increase in general and administrative expense was also attributable to higher spending on information technology and other general support functions the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and the positive impact in 2004 of a payment received in the second quarter of 2004 to settle certain litigation the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased spending related to instrument development and to a lesser extent rapid assay and pharmaceutical product development 

  water operating expenses for water increased 07 million or 6 to 123 million from 116 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue were approximately constant at 22 the dollar increase was attributable to a 13 06 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 12 02 million increase in research and development expense partly offset by a 2 01 million decrease in sales and marketing expense the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and to a lesser extent from the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased spending on cryptosporidium testing product development there were no significant individual events or fluctuations in the nature and amounts of sales and marketing expense 

  production animal segment operating expenses for pas increased 63 million or 44 to 205 million from 142 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 46 from 45 the increase resulted from a 103 41 million increase in general and administrative expense a 26 15 million increase in sales and marketing expense and a 15 07 million increase in research and development expense the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses associated with the acquisition of bommeli in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the subsequent centralization of our european production animal diagnostics operations in bern switzerland these costs are composed mainly of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the bommeli business costs related to the cessation of production in our swedenbased facility and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired to a lesser extent higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the addition of bommeli sales and marketing activities and from sales and marketing costs to support the launch of our herdchek ® bse antigen test kit the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to the addition of bommeli research and development activities and to higher compensation costs partly offset by reduced development activity following the launch of our herdchek ® bse antigen test kit 

  unallocated amounts operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments consisting primarily of corporate research and development increased 03 million or 10 to 35 million from 32 million for the prior year due mainly to increased longterm development activities 

interest income and interest expense interest income was 32 million for 2005 and 2004 the impact of higher interest rates was substantially offset by the impact of lower average invested cash balances 

interest expense was 01 million for 2005 compared to 02 million in 2004 the decrease was primarily due to interest incurred on a tax payment in december 2004 and the final payment of a note payable in february 2005 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 342 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 297 for the year ended december 31 2004 the majority of this rate differential resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2004 of an irs income tax audit through the year ended december 31 2001 as a result of completing this audit we reduced previously accrued taxes other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates in addition 2005 tax expense increased by 10 million and the 2005 effective income tax rate increased by 08 percentage points due to incremental taxes on the repatriation of 300 million pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004  

recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note 2q to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 included in this form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources liquidity we fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations at december 31 2006 and 2005 we had 967 million and 1327 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments respectively and working capital of 1775 million and 1927 million respectively 

we consider the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the us changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences subject to this policy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the us 

in january 2007 we entered into an unsecured shortterm revolving credit facility with a bank in the principal amount of 1250 million that matures on june 30 2007 the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes including repurchases of our common stock and business acquisitions the applicable interest rates generally range from 0375 to 0875 above the london interbank rate or the canadian dollardenominated bankers’ acceptance rate dependent on our leverage ratio under the credit facility we pay quarterly commitment fees of 008 to 020 dependent on our leverage ratio on any unused commitment the credit facility contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants as well as customary events of default that would allow any amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be accelerated or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder in the event of noncompliance the financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest and taxes as defined by the agreement not to exceed 3to1 we expect to enter into a longterm credit facility with similar terms prior to june 30 2007 

we believe that current cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments funds generated from operations and amounts available under credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs we further believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at comparable interest rates to fund our growth objectives the extent and timing of acquisitionsrelated spending and repurchases of our common stock could cause variations on our liquidity and leverage levels 

sources and uses of cash cash provided by operating activities was 1098 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 1166 million for 2005 the total of net income and net noncash charges was 1200 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 1058 million for 2005 reported cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by a change in accounting for the tax benefits from exercises of stock options and disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired in connection with our adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 which reduced reported cash flows from operations by 94 million for the year ended december 31 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 the tax benefit on exercises of stock options and disqualifying dispositions of shares was classified as a cash flow from financing activities whereas the benefit was classified as a cash flow from operating activities in prior years 

in 2006 cash decreased 102 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities whereas in 2005 cash increased by 107 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in a yeartoyear change of 210 million the increase in cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to 331 million of incremental cash used to purchase inventory partly offset by 77 million of additional cash provided by an increase in accrued liabilities during the year ended december 31 2006 the greater incremental increase in inventories was due in part to increased inventories in support of higher sales volumes to our preparation for a supplier’s production facility transition and to ensure adequate supply of certain instrument components and accessories that are being discontinued by the manufacturers the reported increase in cash provided by changes in accrued liabilities compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the change in the presentation of tax benefits noted above of 94 million from exercises of stock options and disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired 

cash used by investing activities was 407 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 126 million for 2005 the increase in cash used by investing activities for 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the increase in cash used for acquisitions an incremental increase of 176 million in 2006 compared to 2005 was largely due to the 152 million paid to acquire a veterinary reference laboratory in canada additionally in 2006 we had lower incremental net proceeds from net sales and maturities of short and longterm investments of 136 million we paid 121 million for the purchase of land and buildings and we had incremental purchases of property and equipment of 81 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate subsidiaries in 16 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions we also utilize some natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions market gains and losses are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals as appropriate until the contract matures which is the period when the related obligation is settled we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 18 months 

our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases for the next twelve months from time to time we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific significant transactions our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods we enter into currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to or less than other specific significant transactions thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income 

our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following year accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle at december 31 2006 we had 13 million in net unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 07 million in taxes 

our currency rate exposure at december 31 2006 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency based on our overall currency rate exposure excluding unrealized losses of 20 million at december 31 2006 and unrealized gains of 08 million at december 31 2005 on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges a 10 weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december 31 2006 would increase or decrease operating income respectively by approximately 31 million in 2007 and a 10 weakening or strengthening of the us dollar from december 31 2005 would have increased or decreased operating income respectively by approximately 26 million in 2006 as of december 31 2006 a 10 weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would increase or reduce operating income respectively by approximately 139 million in 2007 compared to 97 million in 2006

water 

we offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in water 

our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 and colisure ® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water these products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells 

our enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters our quantitray ® products when used in conjunction with our colilert ®  colilert ® 18 colisure ® or enterolert™ products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presenceabsence indication the colilert ®  colilert18 ®  colisure ® and quantitray ® products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries 

our filtamax ® product is used in the detection of cryptosporidia in water cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the united kingdom but is not regulated in other countries at this time 

food diagnostics group 

  production animal services 

we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine producers significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and pseudorabies virus in pigs newcastle disease in poultry and johne’s disease bovine viral diarrhea virus and brucellosis in cattle in december 2004 we completed the acquisition of dr bommeli ag a swiss manufacturer of production animal tests for cash consideration of approximately 158 million net of cash acquired 

we have developed a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” this test was approved for use in the us by the united states department of agriculture “usda” in 2004 and for use in the european union “eu” by the european commission in february 2005 we also offer a related kit for the detection of a similar disease scrapie in small ruminants including sheep testing for bse in the us is limited and we do not know when or if the usda will expand its testing program which would increase the domestic market for these tests 

  dairy testing 

our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the snap ® betalactam test dairy producers and processors use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk and government and foodquality managers use them for ongoing surveillance 

in march 2003 we entered into an agreement with the fda under which we agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap ® betalactam products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were 156 million in 2005 

marketing and distribution 

we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in australia china france germany italy japan the netherlands spain switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom in 2005 2004 and 2003 we spent 1020 million 857 million and 718 million or 16 16 and 15 of sales respectively on sales and marketing 

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and test kits pharmaceutical products and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel outside the us we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we sell our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales force we market our software products through our direct sales force primarily in the us we market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force 

in 2005 two of our cag distributors the butler company and burns veterinary supply inc merged and as a result they collectively accounted for 10 of our 2005 revenue and 4 of our net accounts receivable at december 31 2005 in 2004 and 2003 no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our revenue our largest customers are our us distributors of our products in the cag segment the largest consumer of our products and services accounts for approximately 1 of our sales 

research and development 

our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry into new business areas our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new diagnostic instrument platforms and information systems new immunoassay devices new diagnostic tests new animal drugs enhanced practice information systems and improvements in the performance connectivity and interoperability of our products and services our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and consulting costs were approximately 409 million 354 million and 323 million or 6 6 and 7 of sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

patents and licenses 

we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties these licenses include an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents relating to diagnostic products for fiv that expire in 2009 from the regents of the university of california and exclusive licenses from tulane university and the university of texas to certain patents and patent applications expiring beginning in 2019 that relate to the detection of lyme disease we also have an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents expiring in 2007 relating to defined substrate technology “dst” that is utilized in the colilert ®  colilert18 ®  colisure ® and enterolert™ watertesting products although we do not believe the expiration of the dst patents in 2007 will have a material effect on our water business in addition we hold a us patent expiring in 2014 that specifically covers the colilert®18 product and another patent expiring in 2014 that relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies and which covers certain of our snap ® products including our snap ® combo fivfelv and canine snap ® 3dx ® combination tests 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

production and supply 

vettest ® chemistry analyzers are manufactured for us by tokyo parts industrial company ltd under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew vettest ® slides are supplied exclusively by ortho under supply agreements with ortho the “ortho agreements” we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest ® slides through 2010 the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2020 

the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer is manufactured for us by qbc diagnostics inc “qbcd” under a supply agreement that expires on december 31 2020 the vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzer is manufactured for us by roche diagnostics corporation under an agreement that requires roche diagnostics to supply analyzers through december 31 2006 and consumables and spare parts through december 31 2013 the vetstat™ electrolyte and blood gas analyzer is manufactured for us by osmetech inc under an agreement that requires osmetech to supply analyzers and consumables through 2015 and we have an option to extend this agreement for an additional four years we have certain minimum purchase obligations under these agreements 

we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from a single supplier these include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products certain digital radiography systems instrument consumables and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers we have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers however there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures some of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

    7 

government regulation 

many of our products are subject to regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

  veterinary diagnostic products  most diagnostic tests for animal health applications are veterinary biological products that are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the usda animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine and memphis tennessee 

our instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by fda and does not subject us to the fda’s good manufacturing practices regulations “gmps” these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the fdc act 

  veterinary pharmaceuticals  the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by the center for veterinary medicine “cvm” of the fda a new animal drug may not be commercially marketed in the us unless it has been approved as safe and effective by cvm approval may be requested by filing an nada with cvm containing substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug data regarding manufacturing methods and controls also are required to be submitted with the nada manufacturers of animal drugs must also comply with gmps and good laboratory practices “glps” sales of animal drugs in countries outside the us require compliance with the laws of those countries which may be extensive 

  water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test can be used as part of a waterquality monitoring program in the us that is required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epaapproved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert® colilert®18 colisure® quantitray® filtamax® and simplate® for heterotropic plate counts “hpc” products have been approved by the epa the sale of watertesting products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world 

  dairy testing products  the sale of dairy testing products in the us is regulated by the fda in conjunction with the aoac research institute “aoac ri” before a product can be sold extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the fda and the aoac ri following approval of a product by the fda the product must also be approved by the national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the fda and ncims while some foreign countries accept aoac ri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food drug and waterquality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

employees 

at december 31 2005 we had approximately 3300 fulltime and parttime employees we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are good 




 item 1a risk factors 

our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

  idexxs future growth and profitability depend on several factors 

the future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies including 

      however we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability 

  our products and services are subject to various government regulations 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture “usda” us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap® betalactam dairytesting products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residuetesting products were 156 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda to obtain such approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical manufacturing and other data to the fda regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture labeling storage record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products failure to obtain or delays in obtaining fda approval for new pharmaceutical products would have a negative impact on our future growth 

  we purchase materials for our products from a limited number of sources 

we currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore cannot be readily replaced by alternative sources these products include our vettest ® chemistry vetautoread™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte and vetstat™ electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumables certain digital radiography system components specifically image capture plates and readers active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components of our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the slides sold for use in our vettest ® chemistry analyzers are purchased under an agreement with ortho that as of december 31 2005 required us to purchase a minimum of 927 million of slides through 2010 we purchase our electrolyte instruments components and consumables under an agreement with roche diagnostics under which we are required to purchase a minimum of 41 million of these products through 2006 we purchase our vetautoread™ hematology analyzers components and consumables under an agreement with qbcd under which we are required to make aggregate minimum purchases of 180 million through 2020 if demand for any of the products purchased under these agreements is insufficient to support our minimum purchase obligations for those products we could incur losses related to those obligations in addition because we purchase the products at predetermined prices our profits on sales of these products could decline if we are unable to maintain current pricing levels for such products 

  our biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture 

many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process we attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by continuing to improve the characterization of all of our input materials utilizing multiple vendors manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate characteristics however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  our sales are dependent on distributor purchasing patterns 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors because significant product sales are made to a limited number of customers unanticipated changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results our financial performance therefore is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 

distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer distribution companies consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer concentration level which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph 

  our markets are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies some of our competitors and potential competitors including large pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  changes in diagnostic testing could negatively affect our operating results 

the market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases our production animal services business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence and governmentmandated testing programs such declines in diagnostic testing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  international revenue accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue 

for the year ended december 31 2005 34 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period in addition many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured sourced or both in the us and our costs are incurred in us dollars we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure however an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins 

 we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w ayers our president chief executive officer and chairman we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr ayers the loss of mr ayers could have a material impact on our business 

 the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches research and development expenditures litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

 in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities we believe that we have adequately accrued for all potential tax liabilities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions if we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives our inability to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business overview 

we operate primarily through three business segments the companion animal group “cag” water testing business “water” and the food diagnostics group “fdg” cag is comprised of the following product and service categories instruments and consumables rapid assays reference laboratory and consulting services practice information management and digital radiography systems and pharmaceuticals water develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water fdg develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and dairy products other items that are not included in our reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development and interest income 

for the three years ended december 31 2005 revenues by product and service categories were as follows in thousands  

 the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

  companion animal group 

in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution permits us to offer integrated diseasemanagement solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and outside laboratory testing and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems including connecting the electronic health record with laboratory test data inclinic test data from our idexx vetlab ® suite of analyzers and radiographic data in the idexxpacs™ software taken by our digital radiography systems 

in the us we sell instrument consumables rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily through distributors and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors rather than sales to veterinarians the endusers because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product therefore we closely track sales of these products by our us distributors to the veterinarians “practicelevel sales” which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products in the discussion of results below we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced positively or negatively by changes in distributor inventories 

  instruments and consumables  our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and in doing so achieve their practice objectives including growth and economic success we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments during the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline 

we have a large installed base of vettest ® chemistry analyzers and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales although in recent years we have grown the annual number of unit instrument placements through sales lease rental and other programs our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

we purchase the consumables used in vettest ® chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2020 this supply agreement provides us with a longterm source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010 and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume under this agreement we are developing and expect to introduce a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the ortho dryslide technology and ortho will supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest ® chemistry analyzer we do not expect this nextgeneration analyzer to be commercially available before the latter part of 2007 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we introduced the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform the vetautoread™ hematology analyzer a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread™ hematology analyzers although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables lasercyte ® consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of vetautoread™ consumables because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte ® consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the vetautoread™ consumables gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer our gross margins on lasercyte ® hematology analyzer sales have been low in the early years of the program due to higher manufacturing service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer as we have gained experience with the analyzer we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs which have improved gross margins on these products particularly in 2005 while we expect that lasercyte ® gross margins will continue to improve they will continue to have a negative impact on overall cag gross margins 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of diagnostic menu flexibility of menu selection accuracy reliability ease of use ability to handle compromised samples time to result analytical capability of software integration with the idexx vetlab ® system education and training and superior sales and customer service our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends in part on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy 

  rapid assays  our rapid assay business comprises singleuse kits for inclinic testing and microwellbased kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior sales and customer service these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which we believe do not include a similar level of support we augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  reference laboratory and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service technology employed and specialized test menu revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories in 2004 we acquired a laboratory in columbus ohio opened a laboratory in seattle washington and acquired vet med lab which is based in germany and is the largest european veterinary reference laboratory in 2005 we acquired laboratories in switzerland the united kingdom and france and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us and germany profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements therefore in the short term new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 

  practice information management and digital radiography systems  these businesses consist of veterinary practice information management systems “pims” including hardware and software and veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems our strategy in the pims business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions backed by superior customer support and education to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives we differentiate our software systems through continually enhanced functionality through regular software releases our veterinaryspecific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals the digital radiography systems also incorporate idexxpacs™ picture archiving and communication software developed by idexx that allows for image enhancement manipulation storage and retrieval and integration with the practice information software our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the companion animal group 

  water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration international sales of watertesting products represented 41 of total water product sales in 2005 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

  food diagnostics group 

  production animal services  we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry cattle and swine diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can be subject to fluctuation in 2005 approximately 77 of our sales in this business was international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 

in 2004 we received usda approval of our postmortem test for bse mad cow disease and in february 2005 we were informed that this test was approved by the european commission for sale in eu member countries while bse testing is very limited in the us a larger market for bse testing exists in europe 

  dairy testing  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance these testing products use almost exclusively the snap® platform and manufacturing processes of our rapid assay business incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection sales of dairy testing products have declined slightly over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market to increase sales of dairy testing products we look to increase penetration in geographies outside the united states and in the farm segment of the dairy market and to develop product line enhancements and extensions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to inventory goodwill and other intangible assets warranty reserves income taxes contingencies and revenue recognition we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 included in this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these financial statements 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  inventory 

inventories include material labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we estimated additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on results of operations certain major components of inventory are discussed in more detail below 

  lasercyte ® hematology analyzer  at december 31 2005 and 2004 our net inventories included 98 million and 119 million respectively of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte ® hematology instrument in addition we had firm purchase commitments for an additional 26 million of component parts as of december 31 2005 at december 31 2005 and 2004 23 million and 19 million of the net lasercyte ® inventory respectively required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods at december 31 2005 and 2004 the inventory subject to rework was net of 07 million and 03 million writedowns respectively for inventory estimated to be obsolete we expect to fully realize our net investment in inventory and purchase commitments however if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 

  vettest chemistry ® slides  at december 31 2005 and 2004 our net inventories included 144 million and 227 million respectively of slides used in our vettest ® chemistry analyzers the decrease in slide inventory at december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 was primarily due to the delay of inventory receipts from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006 most of the slides have a shelflife of 24 months at the date of manufacture the average remaining shelflife at december 31 2005 was 164 months in addition we are required to purchase a minimum of 927 million of slides from ortho through december 31 2010 during the quarter ended december 31 2003 we entered into a new contract with ortho which extended the term of the supply agreement through 2018 and left the contract minimum purchase commitments unchanged in june 2005 we further amended this agreement to among other things extend its term from 2018 to 2020 as a result of the current and projected demand for vettest® slides our commitment to develop a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer that will utilize these slides and the ratable decrease in required annual slide purchases from ortho through 2010 we believe that we will not incur a loss under the contract see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 included in this form 10k for additional discussion of our development commitment 

  nitazoxanide  our nitazoxanide product navigator® for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis “epm” was approved by the fda in november 2003 at december 31 2005 our inventories included 94 million of inventory associated with navigator® consisting of 02 million of finished goods and 92 million of active ingredient and other raw materials in december 2004 we entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which we paid the supplier 09 million in january 2005 and the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longerdated material the payment was capitalized as inventory cost we believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale 

  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are valued at fair value when acquired if a market value is not readily available the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on expected cash flows of the associated business acquired that are attributable to the intangible asset goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the other net assets acquired 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

       we continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas no 144” if an impairment review is triggered we evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows the asset is written down to its estimated fair value in determining expected future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups the cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 

under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” we are required to perform annual tests of goodwill for impairment or additional tests whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist for our annual impairment tests we identify our reporting units allocate assets and liabilities including goodwill to the reporting units and compare the reporting units’ net book value to their estimated fair value the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the cash flow estimates used contain our best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time if a reporting unit’s net book value exceeds its fair value then the implied fair value of goodwill is determined if the net book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess no impairment has been identified as a result of the annual reviews 

  warranty reserves 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue at the time revenue is recognized our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates which are based on historical data revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had accrued 32 million and 37 million for estimated warranty expense respectively including warranty reserves of 25 million and 33 million respectively for lasercyte® hematology analyzers warranty expense was 22 million 36 million and 36 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

the decrease in the warranty liability during 2005 compared to 2004 was due to the improved reliability of the lasercyte® hematology analyzer partially offset by the impact of the growing installed base of lasercyte® hematology analyzers the increase in warranty liability during 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the impact of the growing installed base of lasercyte® hematology analyzers partially offset by a reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments we charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte® revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience the reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of 03 million and 06 million in cost of product revenue for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  income taxes 

we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income respectively in the period such determination was made 

we consider the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states the cumulative amount of which was 796 million at december 31 2005 no provision has been made for united states federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries during 2005 we repatriated approximately 300 million under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and recorded a tax provision of 10 million related to this repatriation should we repatriate nonunited states earnings in the future we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made 

  estimates for certain contingencies 

under our workers’ compensation insurance policy for us employees for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we retain the first 250000 in claim liability per incident and 28 million 30 million and 14 million respectively in aggregate claim liability we entered into a similar workers’ compensation insurance policy effective january 1 2006 we estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims based on this analysis we have recognized cumulative expenses of 07 million 06 million and 07 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

under our employee health care insurance policy we retain claims liability risk up to 125000 per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month which was estimated to be 139 million at december 31 2005 we estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage our claims experience the number of employees enrolled in the program and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported should actual employee health care claims liability exceed estimates we are liable for up to an additional 17 million for potential uninsured obligations at december 31 2005 we have insurance coverage of 10 million for claims above the aggregate limit should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage 

from time to time we are notified that a claim is being made against us we evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim if warranted we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly 

  revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when four criteria are met these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 

     when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under the emerging issues task force consensus on issue 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” accordingly the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers the deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 

we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings which may give customers credits award points or tradein rights awards points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us andor toward future purchase of our products and services we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits points actually awarded and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue for the snapupthesavings™ program estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers for our practice developer™ volume discount program we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures during 2005 we notified customers that effective november 30 2005 unused points awarded prior to january 1 2004 including points issued under the snapupthesavings™ program would be canceled and that on november 30 of each subsequent year unused points issued prior to january 1 of the prior year would also be canceled the value of points canceled in 2005 was less than 01 million 

we may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future for tradein rights we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average tradein value 

we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances might be required 

results of operations 

twelve months ended december 31 2005 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2004 

revenue 

total company revenue increased 889 million or 16 to 6381 million from 5492 million for the prior year the following table presents revenue by operating segment 

 1   represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended december 31 2004 to the 12 months ended december 31 2005 

  companion animal group revenue for cag increased 721 million or 16 to 5208 million from 4487 million for the prior year incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 and 2005 consisting of veterinary reference laboratories and a digital radiography business contributed approximately 7 to cag revenue growth during the period the following table presents revenue by product and service categories for cag 

 1   represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended december 31 2004 to the 12 months ended december 31 2005 

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

because our instrument consumables rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products are sold in the us and certain other geographies by distributors distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices who are the endusers distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying enduser demand for our products fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying enduser demand therefore we believe it is important to track distributor sales to endusers and to distinguish between the impact of enduser demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth 

where growth rates are affected by changes in enduser demand we refer to the impact of practicelevel sales on growth where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales in the current period conversely if during the comparable period of the prior year distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year then distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales in the current period 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to increased sales volume the increased sales volume of consumables was due primarily to higher worldwide practicelevel sales of vettest ® slides to a lesser extent increased domestic sales of consumables used with our vetlyte ® electrolyte analyzers and higher practicelevel sales of tubes used with our hematology instruments also resulted in increased sales volume of consumables increased vettest ® chemistry and hematology consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments throughout 2004 and 2005 the increase in sales of vetlyte ® consumables was due in part to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to product unavailability which had a favorable impact of 1 on the growth rate for instruments and consumables during 2005 increased instrument sales volume resulted mainly from higher sales of lasercyte ® hematology analyzers and to a lesser extent the launch of our vetstat™ electrolyte and blood gas analyzer 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products was due primarily to increased domestic practicelevel sales volume of our canine combination test the snap ® 3dx ® canine test and to higher average unit sales prices for canine and feline products 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases and higher testing volume incremental sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 contributed approximately 23 to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth during 2005 

the increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems resulted from increased sales volume of digital radiography instruments the increase in digital radiography revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold including sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 incremental sales from this acquired business contributed approximately 7 to practice information management and digital radiography systems revenue growth during 2005 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from increased practicelevel demand and to a lesser extent from price increases on certain products we expect pharmaceutical revenue for 2006 as a percentage of 2005 revenue to grow at a lower rate of 15 to 20 

  water revenue for water increased 37 million or 7 to 568 million from 531 million for the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume partly offset by lower average unit sales prices attributable to both greater price competition in certain geographies and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of 02 million or less than 1 to the increase in water revenue 

  food diagnostics group revenue for fdg increased 131 million or 28 to 605 million from 474 million for the prior year incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 11 to fdg revenue growth during the year the following table presents revenue by product and service categories for fdg 

 1   represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended december 31 2004 to the 12 months ended december 31 2005 

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

the increase in sales of production animal products resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume of livestock and to a lesser extent poultry diagnostics including sales attributable to acquisitions in 2004 incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 17 to production animal products revenue growth during the period 

the decrease in sales of dairy testing products resulted primarily from the divestiture of the parallux™ product line and from lower average unit sales prices attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices these decreases were partially offset by higher unit sales of snap ® tests 

gross profit 

  total company gross profit increased 439 million or 16 to 3229 million from 2790 million for the prior year and as a percentage of total revenue was approximately constant at 51 the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage by operating segment 

 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” and will expense sharebased compensation beginning on january 1 2006 which will have a negative impact on our future gross profit percentages and on operating margins for all of our segments 

  companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 355 million or 17 to 2504 million from 2149 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product lines as a percentage of revenue cag gross profit was approximately constant at 48 the gross profit percentage was positively impacted by relatively higher selling prices particularly for laboratory and consulting services and rapid assay products lower product and service costs associated with the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and lower product cost of slides sold for use in our vettest ® chemistry analyzers under the agreement with our supplier and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses the increases in the gross profit percentage were largely offset by higher overall net product and service costs apart from the favorable lasercyte ® and slide costs mentioned above greater relative sales of lower margin products and services mainly from higher sales growth of laboratory services and writedowns of excess pharmaceutical product inventory 

  water gross profit for water increased 24 million or 7 to 383 million from 359 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume partly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage to 67 from 68 the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by costs related to a manufacturing issue during the third quarter of 2005 and by lower average unit sales prices these decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

  food diagnostics group gross profit for fdg increased 60 million or 21 to 342 million from 282 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 57 from 60 during the same period of the prior year a reduction of approximately 18 million in an estimated liability for a third party claim was accounted for as a reduction in cost of revenue and increased the 2004 gross profit percentage by four percentage points for 2005 an unfavorable impact on the gross margin percentage of two percentage points was attributable to incremental acquisition integration costs the gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products and by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses partially offset by higher net product costs 

operating expenses and operating income 

  total company total operating expenses increased 366 million to 2076 million from 1710 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating expenses increased to 33 from 31 for the prior year 

operating income increased 73 million to 1153 million from 1080 million for the prior year as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased to 18 from 20 during 2005 operating income was reduced by acquisition integration costs associated with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 including costs incurred in connection with the centralization of our european production animal diagnostics operations in bern switzerland during 2004 operating income benefited from the settlement of a third party claim described above and a payment received in settlement of litigation partly offset by acquisition integration costs these discrete items in both years resulted in a reported decrease in operating income as a percentage of total company revenue of one percentage point the remaining difference in the operating income percentage for 2005 compared to the prior year was attributable in part to the expansion of the cag sales customer service and marketing organization during 2004 and the first half of 2005 amortization expense for intangible assets purchased in connection with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 and other changes in gross profit and operating expenses described in this narrative

    companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 296 million or 22 to 1674 million from 1378 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 32 from 31 the increase was attributable to a 21 151 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 25 101 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 17 44 million increase in research and development expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the expansion of the worldwide sales customer service and marketing organization ongoing expenses attributable to the vet med lab business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and to a lesser extent the digital radiography business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses attributable to businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005 comprised of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and integration costs to a lesser extent the increase in general and administrative expense was also attributable to higher spending on information technology and other general support functions the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and the positive impact in 2004 of a payment received in the second quarter of 2004 to settle certain litigation the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased spending related to instrument development and to a lesser extent rapid assay and pharmaceutical product development 

  water operating expenses for water increased 07 million or 6 to 123 million from 116 million for the prior year and as a percentage of revenue were approximately constant at 22 the dollar increase was attributable to a 13 06 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 12 02 million increase in research and development expense partly offset by a 2 01 million decrease in sales and marketing expense the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and to a lesser extent from the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased spending on cryptosporidium testing product development there were no significant individual events or fluctuations in the nature and amounts of sales and marketing expense

  other operating expenses consisting primarily of corporate research and development increased 03 million or 10 to 35 million from 32 million for the prior year due mainly to increased longterm development activities 

interest income 

net interest income was 31 million for 2005 and 2004 the impact of higher interest rates was substantially offset by the impact of lower average invested cash balances 

provision for income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 342 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 297 for the year ended december 31 2004 the majority of this rate differential resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2004 of an irs income tax audit through the year 2001 as a result of completing this audit we reduced previously accrued taxes other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates in addition 2005 tax expense increased by 10 million and the 2005 effective income tax rate increased by 08 percentage points due to incremental taxes on the repatriation of 300 million pursuant to the american jobs creation act of 2004

 1   represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended december 31 2003 to the 12 months ended december 31 2004 

the following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables an increase of 206 million or 12 was due mainly to increased sales volume including higher domestic practicelevel sales of vettest ® slides and to a lesser extent tubes used with our hematology instruments as well as higher volume outside the us the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us increased instrument sales due primarily to increased sales of the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments during 2003 and 2004 shipments to distributors during the twelve months ended december 31 2003 were reduced as a result of the company’s continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel the reduced shipments during 2003 had a positive impact on sales growth in the 2004 period the collective impact of favorable currency exchange and favorable comparisons resulting from lower distributor purchases in 2003 caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying practicelevel growth of instruments and consumables 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of 105 million or 13 was due primarily to increased domestic practicelevel sales volume of canine and to a lesser extent feline products as well as demand for our snap ® test to screen dogs and cats for giardia infection which was launched during the first quarter of 2004 the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us shipments to distributors during 2003 were reduced as a result of the company’s efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel which contributed to a reported sales growth in the 2004 period the collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable currency exchange caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying practicelevel growth of rapid assay products 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services an increase of 239 million or 25 resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories mainly in the us and to a lesser extent in the united kingdom and australia the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in late 2003 and in 2004 and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us and higher pricing 

the increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems an increase of 57 million or 25 resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems partly offset by lower service sales 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products an increase of 35 million or 51 resulted in part from sales of new products launched in 2003 and 2004 

  water revenue for water increased 62 million or 13 to 531 million from 469 million for the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us partly offset by lower average unit prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 19 million or 4 to the increase in water revenue 

  food diagnostics group revenue for fdg increased 28 million or 6 to 474 million from 446 million for the same period of the prior year businesses acquired during 2004 contributed approximately 1 to fdg revenue growth during the year the following table presents revenue by product and service categories for fdg 

 1   represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from the 12 months ended december 31 2003 to the 12 months ended december 31 2004 

the increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us and higher sales volume of production animal diagnostics these increases were partly offset by lower average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and dairytesting products and by decreased sales volume of dairytesting products the increase in production animal diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of livestock products outside the us the lower average unit prices were attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and to a lesser extent to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 24 million or 5 to the increase in fdg revenue 

gross profit

   companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 393 million or 22 to 2149 million from 1756 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of cag revenue gross profit increased to 48 from 46 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to productivity improvements across cag product lines and services the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses and to a lesser extent favorable pricing from our supplier of slide consumables compared to the same period of the prior year the productivity improvements were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs related to our lasercyte ® hematology analyzer and to a lesser extent to fixed costs spread over a higher revenue base the lasercyte ® service cost improvements generated a favorable change in our accruals for cost of product warranties and extended maintenance agreements for all placed instruments for which we have such future obligations 

these increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in 2004 including due to the purchase accounting impact of writing off supplies and to a lesser extent by other laboratory service expansion costs including startup costs of laboratories opened in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2004 

  water gross profit for water increased 44 million or 14 to 359 million from 315 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased revenue as a percentage of water revenue gross profit increased to 68 from 67 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses

the increase in accrued expenses was due to the impact of higher income tax accruals in 2005 compared to 2004 and the impact of higher accruals for points granted to customers under our practice developer™ volume discount program in 2005 compared to 2004 the higher income tax accruals were due in part to the rate reduction in 2004 resulting from the resolution of an irs income tax audit through the year 2001 which lowered the accrual in 2004 relative to 2005 and the impact of differences in the timing of expense recognition in the financial statements compared to income tax deductibility the incremental cash generated from accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of payments to vendors including contractual purchase commitments to ortho for vettest ® slides the incremental cash generated from inventory was due to lower inventories of vettest ® slides and lasercyte ® hematology analyzers partially offset by higher vetautoread™ instrument and consumable inventory the decrease in the vettest ® slide inventory was due to the deferral of receipts of slides from ortho from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006 the decrease in cash to fund accounts receivable was due to higher sales the 59 million increase in depreciation and amortization was due primarily to acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate subsidiaries in 15 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 18 months gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals as appropriate and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods our hedging strategy provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following twelve months accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle at december 31 2005 we had 06 million in net unrealized gains on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 03 million in taxes 

our currency rate exposure at december 31 2005 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency based on our overall currency rate exposure excluding unrealized gains of 08 million at december 31 2005 and unrealized losses of 43 million at december 31 2004 on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately 26 million for 2006 and a 10 strengthening of the us dollar from december 31 2004 would have reduced operating income for 2005 by approximately 33 million a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december 31 2005 would increase operating income by approximately 26 million in 2006 a 10 weakening of the us dollar from december 31 2004 would have increased operating income by approximately 33 million in 2005 as of december 31 2005 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would reduce operating income by approximately 97 million in 2006 compared to 99 million in 2005 and the effects of a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would increase operating income by approximately 97 million in 2006 compared to 99 million in 2005

companion animal group   rapid assays 

we provide a broad range of singleuse handheld test kits that allow quick in most cases less than ten minutes accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention if required 

our principal singleuse tests are sold under the snap ® name and include a feline combination test the snap ® combo fiv antibodyfelv antigen test which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus “fiv” which is similar to the human aids virus and feline leukemia virus “felv” a canine combination test the snap ® 3dx ®  which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm a canine heartwormonly test and canine and feline tests for giardia  a parasitic disease sales of heartworm tests are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease 

in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek ® name which are used by larger clinics and independent laboratories to test multiple samples petchek ® tests offer accuracy ease of use and cost advantages to highvolume customers we currently sell petchek ® tests for felv fiv and canine heartworm disease 

  instruments and consumables 

we currently market several instrument systems as well as associated consumable products for use in veterinary clinics these instruments which we refer to collectively as the idexx vetlab ®  are described below 

  blood and urine chemistry  our vettest ® blood and urine chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions twentythree separate tests can be performed on the vettest ® analyzer blood tests commonly run include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase creatinine bun blood urea nitrogen and total protein the vettest ® also runs tests for urine proteinurine creatinine ratio which assists in the detection of early renal disease tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels such as the preanesthetic panel and the general health profile 

we purchase all of the reagents used in the vettest ® analyzer “dry chemistry slides” or “vettest ® slides” from orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” a subsidiary of johnson  johnson see “businessproduction and supply” in october 2003 we entered into a new agreement with ortho under which we are developing a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on ortho’s dryslide technology and ortho will supply the slide consumables used in both the vettest ® analyzer and the new analyzer through 2018 we do not expect this new instrument to be commercially available before 2006 

  hematology  we sell two hematology analyzers the lasercyte ® system which uses laserflow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets and the qbc ® vetautoread™ hematology analyzer which is based on the becton dickinson  company “becton dickinson” qbc® autoread™ hematology system that is sold to physicians for human applications we purchase all of our qbc ® vetautoread™ analyzers and consumables from becton dickinson 

  electrolytes and blood gases  our vetlyte ® system measures three electrolytes—sodium potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration test results are available in less than one minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the vetlyte ® analyzer or downloaded to the vettest ® analyzer we purchase our vetlyte® instruments and consumables from roche diagnostics corporation 

our vetstat™ analyzer which we expect to introduce in the second quarter of 2005 measures electrolytes blood gases acidbase balance glucose and ionized calcium and calculates other parameters such as bicarbonate and anion gap these measurements aid veterinarians in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function the vetstat™ analyzer runs singleuse disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes and provides results in less than two minutes we purchase all of our vetstat™ analyzers and consumables from osmetech inc 

  quantitative hormone testing  the vettest ® snap ® reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones including thyroxine t 4  and cortisol these measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases such as hyper and hypothyroidism cushing’s syndrome and addison’s disease samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our snap ® device platform 

  veterinary laboratory and consulting services 

we offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians in the us europe australia and japan in november 2004 we completed the acquisition of vet med lab a laboratory based in germany for cash consideration of approximately 313 million net of cash acquired in february 2004 we completed the acquisition of a veterinary laboratory located in ohio for cash consideration of 53 million and issued 10 million in notes payable veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals 

additionally we provide specialized veterinary consultation telemedicine and advisory services including cardiology radiology internal medicine and ultrasound consulting these services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet from the veterinarians’ offices 

  information products and services and digital radiography systems 

  information products and services  we develop market and sell practice information management software systems and related hardware that run key functions of veterinary clinics including scheduling billing and patient records management our systems permit automated electronic transfer of test results from our idexx vetlab analyzers and from our veterinary reference laboratories directly into the patients’ medical records we believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software systems in north america with an installed base of more than 7300 of the approximately 25000 veterinary hospitals in north america we also provide software and hardware support and related supplies and we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts 

  digital radiography systems  we market and sell two digital radiography systems the idexx digital radiography system which is appropriate for use in the veterinary clinic and the idexx digital radiography compact system which is primarily used as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices such as equine practices our digital radiography systems generate digital radiograph images which replace traditional xray film use of digital radiographs eliminates the need for the film and processor hazardous chemicals and darkroom required for the production of film images 

  pharmaceutical products 

we develop market and sell novel therapeutics for the veterinary market we currently market and sell four pharmaceutical products pzi vet ®  an insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats acarexx ® 01 ivermectin otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats surpass ® 1 diclofenac sodium a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for equine use and navigator ® 32 nitazoxanide antiprotozoal oral paste a treatment for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis epm we are developing a longacting injectable form of the antibiotic tilmicosin for cats our new animal drug application “nada” for this product is under review by the us food and drug administration “fda” and we do not expect fda approval of this product before 2006 

water our colilert ®  colilert18 and colisure ® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water these products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells 

our enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters our quantitray ® products when used in conjunction with our colilert ®  colilert18 colisure ® or enterolert™ products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather then a presenceabsence indication the colilert ®  colilert18 colisure ® and quantitray ® products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries 

in august 2000 we acquired genera technologies limited a ukbased company that develops and sells products for detection of cryptosporidia in water cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the united kingdom but is not regulated in other countries at this time 

food diagnostics group   production animal services 

we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine producers significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and pseudorabies virus in pigs newcastle disease in poultry and johne’s disease and brucellosis in cattle in december 2004 we completed the acquisition of dr bommeli ag a swiss manufacturer of production animal tests for cash consideration of approximately 158 million net of cash acquired 

we have developed a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” or “mad cow disease” this test was approved for use in the us by the united states department of agriculture “usda” in 2004 and for use in the european union “eu” by the european commission in february 2005 testing for bse in the us is limited and we do not know when or if the usda will expand its testing program which would increase the domestic market for these tests the european union “eu” maintains a much more significant testing program and we believe approximately 10 million tests are performed annually in eu member countries 

  dairy testing 

our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the snap ® betalactam test dairy producers and processors use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk and government and foodquality managers use them for ongoing surveillance 

in march 2003 we entered into an agreement with the fda under which we agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap ® betalactam products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were 157 million in 2004 

marketing and distribution we market sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in australia china france germany italy japan the netherlands spain switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom in 2004 2003 and 2002 we spent 857 million 718 million and 568 million or 16 15 and 14 of sales respectively on sales and marketing 

generally we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments and laboratory services sold directly by idexx sales personnel and test kits pharmaceutical products and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel outside the us we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through our direct sales force and in certain countries through distributors and other resellers we market our software products and veterinary laboratory services through our direct sales force we market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force 

in 2004 2003 and 2002 no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our sales our largest customers are our us distributors of our products in the cag segment the largest consumer of our products accounts for approximately 1 of our sales 

research and development our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry into new business areas our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new diagnostic instrument platforms new immunoassay devices new diagnostic tests new animal drugs and improvements to our products and services our research and development expenses which consist of salaries employee benefits materials and consulting costs were approximately 354 million 323 million and 293 million or 6 7 and 7 of sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

patents and licenses we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties these licenses include an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents relating to diagnostic products for fiv that expire in 2009 from the regents of the university of california an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents expiring in 2007 that are utilized in the colilert ®  colilert18 colisure ® and enterolert™ watertesting products and exclusive licenses from tulane university and the university of texas to certain patents and patent applications expiring beginning in 2019 that relate to the detection of lyme disease in addition we hold a us patent that expires in 2014 and relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies which covers our snap ® combo fivfelv and canine snap ® 3dx ® combination tests 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—future operating results” 

production and supply vettest ® analyzers are manufactured for us by tokyo parts industrial company ltd under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew vettest ® slides are supplied exclusively by ortho under supply agreements with ortho the “ortho agreements” we are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of vettest ® slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest ® slides through 2010 the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2018 

the qbc ® vetautoread™ system is manufactured for us by becton dickinson under a development and distribution agreement that requires becton dickinson to supply analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010 becton dickinson is the sole source of these analyzers and reagents 

the vetlyte ® system is manufactured for us by roche diagnostics corporation under an agreement that requires roche diagnostics to supply analyzers through december 31 2006 and consumables and spare parts through december 31 2013 we have certain minimum purchase obligations under this agreement 

we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from only one source these include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products including navigator ®  digital radiography systems vetstat™ instruments and consumables and certain components used in our snap ® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte ® systems 

we have in the past been successful in extending important sole and single source supply agreements to ensure an uninterrupted supply of the relevant products and we will seek in the future to extend any such agreements that would otherwise expire under their terms however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in extending any such agreements on equivalent or better terms or that we will be able to extend such agreements at all 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures some of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do

in the cag segment we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings the breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution permits us to offer integrated diseasemanagement solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and laboratory testing and facilitates the flow of medical information in the clinic by integrating practicemanagement software systems with laboratory test results and inclinic test results from our idexx vetlab ® analyzers 

in the us we sell instrument consumables rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily through distributors and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors rather than sales to veterinarians the endusers because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product therefore we closely track sales of these products by our us distributors to the clinics “cliniclevel sales” which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products in the discussion of results below we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced positively or negatively by changes in distributor inventories 

  instruments and instrument consumables  our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments during the early stage of an instruments life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline 

we have a large installed base of vettest ® chemistry analyzers and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales although we continue to place instruments through sales and through rental and other programs our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition customer retention and increased customer utilization of those instruments to increase utilization we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

we purchase the consumables used in vettest ® chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2018 this supply agreement provides us with a longterm source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010 and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume under this agreement we are developing and expect to introduce a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the ortho dryslide technology and ortho would supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest ® chemistry analyzer we do not expect this nextgeneration analyzer to be commercially available before 2006 our declining cost of vettest slides is expected to improve margins in our instruments and consumables product line beginning in 2006 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we introduced the lasercyte ® hematology analyzer which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform the qbc ® vetautoread™ system a substantial portion of lasercyte ® placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our qbc ® vetautoread™ instruments although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables lasercyte ® consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of qbc ® vetautoread™ consumables because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte ® consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the qbc ® vetautoread™ consumables gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte ® system our gross margins on lasercyte ® system sales have been low due to higher manufacturing service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer as we have gained experience with the analyzer we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs which has improved margins while we expect that lasercyte ® margins will continue to improve they will continue to have a negative impact on overall cag gross margins 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability quality of diagnostic information reliability integration with the idexx vetlab ® suite and customer service our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends in part on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy 

  laboratory and consulting services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service and technology revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories in february 2004 we acquired a laboratory in columbus ohio in november 2004 we opened a laboratory in seattle washington and we acquired vet med lab which is based in germany and is the largest european veterinary reference laboratory profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements new laboratories typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements therefore in the short term new and acquired laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 

  rapid assays  our rapid assay business comprises singleuse kits for inclinic testing and microwellbased kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which we believe do not include a similar level of support we augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

  water 

our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration international sales of watertesting products represented 41 of total water product sales in 2004 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe 

  food diagnostics group 

  production animal services  we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry cattle and swine diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can be subject to fluctuation in 2004 approximately 73 of our sales in this business was international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 

in 2004 we received usda approval of our postmortem test for bse mad cow disease and in february 2005 we were informed that this test was approved by the european commission for sale in eu member countries while bse testing is very limited in the us a significant market for bse testing exists in europe and marketing and sale of this product will be a major priority for our production animal services business in 2005 

  dairy testing  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residuetesting products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance sales of dairytesting products have declined over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market to increase sales of dairytesting products we will need to increase penetration in geographies outside the united states and in the farm segment of the dairy market 

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations restructuring and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  inventory 

our inventories include material labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 

as of december 31 2004 and 2003 our net inventories included 119 million and 72 million respectively of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte ® hematology instrument in addition we had firm purchase commitments for an additional 19 million of component parts as of december 31 2004 as of december 31 2004 and 2003 22 million and 37 million of this inventory respectively required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods as of december 31 2004 the inventory was net of a 03 million writedown for inventory estimated to be obsolete there were no writedowns of this inventory as of december 31 2003 for inventory estimated to be obsolete we expect to fully realize our investment in inventory and purchase commitments however if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 

navigator ® is our pharmaceutical product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis “epm” that we launched during the fourth quarter of 2003 our inventories as of december 31 2004 included 87 million of inventory associated with navigator ®  consisting of 04 million of finished goods and 83 million of active ingredient and other raw materials in december 2004 we entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide the active ingredient in navigator ®  under which we paid the supplier 09 million in january 2005 and the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longerdated material we believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale 

  valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill 

we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

      when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above we measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows net intangible assets and goodwill totaled 1245 million as of december 31 2004 consisting of 692 million related to veterinary laboratories of which 541 million represents goodwill 193 million related to production animal services of which 76 million represents goodwill 192 million related to watertesting products of which 169 million represents goodwill 157 million related to pharmaceutical products of which 137 million represents goodwill and 11 million of other of which 06 million represents goodwill 

  revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when four criteria are met these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the sales price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 

    16 

  when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under eitf 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” accordingly the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers the deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 

we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings which may give customers credits award points which may be applied to trade amounts owed us andor toward future purchase of our products and services or tradein rights we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits points actually awarded and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue for the snapupthesavings™ program estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers for our practice developer™ volume discount program we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures 

we may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future for these tradein rights we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average tradein value in 2001 we began offering guaranteed tradein values on current sales of our qbc ® vetautoread™ instruments when the customer subsequently trades in the qbc ® vetautoread™ instrument for a lasercyte ® system to qualify for a guaranteed tradein value the customer must trade in their qbc ® vetautoread™ instrument within five years of original purchase the value of the tradein depends on the amount of time from original purchase to tradein we have recorded a tradein reserve of 05 million for these tradeins the maximum tradein liability at december 31 2004 was 34 million and we anticipate that we would receive equipment valued at 09 million if all customers were to exercise their tradein rights 

we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances might be required 

  income taxes 

we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas no 109” this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to state and international net operating loss carryforwards and certain other unrealizable international deferred tax assets while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

we consider the operating earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states the cumulative amount of which was 855 million as of december 31 2004 no provision has been made for united states federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries should we repatriate nonunited states earnings we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made 

the recently enacted american jobs creation act of 2004 allows for a reduced rate of united states tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the united states we are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final determination as to the amounts if any that will be repatriated as such the income tax effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated 

  warranty reserves 

we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates which are based on historical data revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had accrued 37 million and 33 million for estimated warranty expense respectively including warranty reserves of 33 million and 31 million respectively for lasercyte ® systems warranty expense was 36 million 36 million and 04 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

the increase in warranty liability during 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the impact of the growing installed base of lasercyte ® systems partially offset by a reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments we charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte ® revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its twoyear warranty period cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience the reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of 06 million in cost of product revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 

we sell extended maintenance agreements covering our instruments we anticipate that losses will be incurred for certain of these contracts and have recognized provisions for the estimated losses the anticipated loss reserves were 01 million and 04 million as of december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  estimates for certain claims 

we purchase insurance policies annually for individual and aggregate amounts of employee health insurance claims we are selfinsured for up to 01 million per claim and up to an annual aggregate limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month which was estimated to be 120 million as of december 31 2004 we estimate our liability for employee health claims based on individual and aggregate coverage our monthly claims experience the number of employees enrolled in the program and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported 

we purchase workers’ compensation insurance policies annually prior to january 1 2003 we were fully insured for workers’ compensation claims beginning january 1 2003 we purchased an insurance policy under which we are liable for the first 025 million in claims per occurrence and up to an aggregate limit based on payroll which was approximately 30 million and 14 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively we entered into a similar policy effective january 1 2005 we estimate our liability for workers’ compensation claims based on the insurance policy limits claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to litigate andor settle the claims based on this analysis we have recognized cumulative expenses of 06 million and 09 million for claims incurred during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

periodically we are notified that a claim is being made against us we evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim if warranted we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly 

results of operations twelve months ended december 31 2004 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2003 revenue   total company revenue for the total company increased 732 million or 15 to 5492 million from 4760 million in the same period of the prior year the following table presents revenue for the company and its operating segments 

    companion animal group revenue for cag increased 643 million or 17 to 4487 million from 3844 million in the same period of the prior year this increase resulted primarily from increased sales of laboratory and consulting services and instruments and consumables and to a lesser degree rapid assay products information products and services digital radiography systems and pharmaceutical products the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 105 million or 3 to the increase in cag revenue 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services an increase of 239 million or 25 resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories mainly in the us and to a lesser extent in the uk and australia the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in late 2003 and in 2004 and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us and higher pricing growth in sales of laboratory services in 2005 will continue to be positively affected by the inclusion of results from vet med lab a german veterinary reference laboratory that we acquired in november 2004 for 2005 we expect incremental sales from vet med lab of 200 million to 250 million 

the increase in sales of instruments and consumables an increase of 206 million or 12 was due mainly to increased sales volume including higher domestic cliniclevel sales of vettest ® slides and to a lesser extent tubes used with our hematology instruments as well as higher volume outside the us the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us increased instrument sales due primarily to increased sales of the lasercyte ® hematology system and the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments during 2003 and 2004 shipments to distributors during the twelve months ended december 31 2003 were reduced as a result of the company’s continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel the reduced shipments during 2003 had a positive impact on sales growth in the 2004 period the collective impact of favorable currency exchange and favorable comparisons resulting from lower distributor purchases in 2003 caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying cliniclevel growth of instruments and consumables 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of 105 million or 13 was due primarily to increased domestic cliniclevel sales volume of canine and to a lesser extent feline products as well as demand for our new snap ® test to screen dogs and cats for giardia infection which was launched during the first quarter of 2004 the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us shipments to distributors during 2003 were reduced as a result of the company’s efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel which contributed to a reported sales growth in the 2004 period the collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable currency exchange caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying cliniclevel growth of rapid assay products 

the increase in sales of information products and services and digital radiography systems an increase of 57 million or 25 resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems partly offset by lower service sales 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products an increase of 35 million or 51 resulted in part from sales of new products launched in 2003 and 2004 for 2005 we expect slower growth in pharmaceutical sales since we will not benefit from the favorable comparisons created by the 2003 and 2004 product launches and no new product launches are planned for 2005 

  water revenue for water increased 62 million or 13 to 531 million from 469 million for the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us partly offset by lower average unit prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 19 million or 4 to the increase in water revenue for 2005 we expect slower growth in water sales due in part to increased competitive pressures 

  food diagnostics group revenue for fdg increased 28 million or 6 to 474 million from 446 million for the same period of the prior year the increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us and higher sales volume of production animal diagnostics these increases were partly offset by lower average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and dairytesting products and by decreased sales volume of dairytesting products the increase in production animal diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of livestock products outside the us the lower average unit prices were attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and to a lesser extent to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 24 million or 5 to the increase in fdg revenue for 2005 we anticipate increased fdg revenue growth led by the launch of our herdchek ® bse antigen test kit a rapid test for detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy “bse” in europe and the fullyear impact of our acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004 of dr bommeli ag “bommeli” a swiss manufacturer of production animal diagnostics 

gross profit   total company gross profit for the total company increased 487 million or 21 to 2790 million from 2303 million for the same period in the prior year as a percentage of total company revenue gross profit increased to 51 in 2004 from 48 in 2003 the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the company and its operating segments 

 as of july 1 2005 we will be required to expense equityrelated compensation which will have a negative impact on our gross profit percentage and on operating margins for all of our segments 

  companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 393 million or 22 to 2149 million from 1756 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of cag revenue gross profit increased to 48 from 46 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to productivity improvements across cag product lines and services the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses and to a lesser extent favorable pricing from our supplier of slide consumables compared to the same period of the prior year the productivity improvements were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs related to our lasercyte ® hematology instrument and to a lesser extent to fixed costs spread over a higher revenue base the lasercyte ® service cost improvements generated a favorable change in our accruals for cost of product warranties and extended maintenance agreements for all placed instruments for which we have such future obligations beginning in 2006 we expect cag gross margin percentage to be favorably affected by improved consumable costs under our supply agreement with ortho 

these increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in 2004 including due to the purchase accounting impact of writing off supplies and to a lesser extent by other laboratory service expansion costs including startup costs of laboratories opened in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2004 the greater proportion of laboratory sales resulting largely from the 2004 acquisitions relative to total cag sales may negatively impact our cag gross margin percentage as laboratory services generally have a lower gross margin than our product businesses 

  water gross profit for water increased 44 million or 14 to 359 million from 315 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased revenue as a percentage of water revenue gross profit increased to 68 from 67 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 

  food diagnostics group gross profit for fdg increased 50 million or 22 to 282 million from 232 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of fdg revenue gross profit increased to 60 from 52 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reductions in an accrual related to a thirdparty claim resulting from the settlement of that claim and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses partly offset by unfavorable product costs the reduction in the accrual for the thirdparty claim resulted in an aggregate benefit recognized in 2004 of 18 million or a fourpercentagepoint increase in the gross margin percentage the unfavorable product costs were due to fixed costs spread over lower production volume in europe and to a lesser extent the impact of expensing a portion of the purchase accounting fair market value adjustment of inventory obtained in connection with the 2004 acquisitions we expect to incur integration costs in 2005 associated with the bommeli acquisition that will negatively impact our fdg gross margin percentage 

operating expenses   total company total company operating expenses increased 211 million to 1710 million from 1499 million for the same period of the prior year as a percentage of revenues operating expenses remained relatively constant at 31 the following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the company and its operating segments 

  21 

  companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 174 million or 14 to 1378 million from 1204 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at 31 from year to year as a percent of sales the increase was attributable to a 23 134 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 10 24 million increase in research and development expense and a 4 16 million increase in general and administrative expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased sales and sales support personnel and marketing program costs the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses and to a lesser extent expenses associated with the vet med lab acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004 the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased staffing and higher spending to support instrument and pharmaceutical product development the increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions partly due to expenses associated with sarbanesoxley act compliance efforts expenses associated with laboratory acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters of 2004 including amortization of intangible assets and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the writedown of fixed assets associated with the discontinuation of development of a clinical chemistry instrument in october 2003 we extended our relationship with ortho the supplier of our vettest ® slides we committed to develop a nextgeneration clinical chemistry system based on ortho’s dryslide technology and discontinued efforts to develop the alternative system 

for 2005 we expect cag operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due primarily to the full year impact of 2004 sales and customer support personnel additions in the us as well as similar investments we plan to make in europe and to integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with the vet med lab acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2004 partly offset by a slight decline in research and development expense as a percent of sales as laboratory services with its negligible research and development spending requirements account for a greater proportion of total cag sales 

  water operating expenses for water increased 11 million or 10 to 116 million from 105 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at 22 from year to year as a percent of sales the increase was attributable to a 25 08 million increase in general and administrative expense a 7 01 million increase in research and development expense and a 2 01 million increase in sales and marketing expense the increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions partly due to expenses associated with sarbanesoxley act compliance efforts the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses and the impact of a gain from a legal settlement in 2003 that was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense there were no significant fluctuations in the nature and amounts of research and development expense or of sales and marketing expense 

  food diagnostics group operating expenses for fdg increased 28 million or 18 to 184 million from 156 million in the same period of the prior year and as a percent of sales increased to 39 from 35 in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 25 11 million increase in general and administrative expense a 14 06 million increase in research and development expense a 5 03 million increase in sales and marketing expense and a 07 million decrease in other income the increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from ongoing expenses associated with the china joint venture formed in 2003 higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions partly due to expenses associated with sarbanesoxley act compliance efforts the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses and expenses associated with the bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004 the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher compensation costs for additional personnel increased spending in support of our herdchek ® bse antigen test kit and expenses associated with the bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004 the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased spending in support of our herdchek ® bse antigen test kit and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencydenominated expenses partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the formation of the china joint venture the decrease in other income results from the nonrecurrence in 2004 of the reduction in an accrual related to a thirdparty claim recorded as other income in 2003 for 2005 we expect fdg operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due to integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with the bommeli acquisition 

  other operating expenses for 2004 consisting primarily of corporate research and development decreased 02 million or 6 to 32 million from 34 million for the same period of the prior year 

interest income net interest income was 31 million for 2004 compared with 29 million during 2003 the increase in interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances partially offset by lower effective interest rates 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 297 for 2004 compared with 315 for 2003 the majority of this rate reduction resulted from the resolution of an irs income tax audit through the year 2001 as a result of completing this audit the company reduced previously accrued taxes other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates partially offset by revisions in 2003 to international tax estimates and a charge to writedown fixed assets occurring in a hightax jurisdiction 

the increase in our valuation allowances from 2002 to 2003 was primarily related to the generation of state net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized the generation of state net operating losses increased our valuation allowance by 05 million the reduction in valuation allowances from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to releasing a valuation allowance that previously offset the international deferred tax assets of an international subsidiary this valuation allowance of 07 million was released as a result of our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 

the recently enacted american jobs creation act of 2004 allows for a reduced rate of united states tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the united states we are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final determination as to the amounts if any that will be repatriated as such the income tax effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated 

twelve months ended december 31 2003 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2002 revenue   total company revenue for the total company increased 633 million or 15 to 4760 million from 4127 million in the same period of the prior year the following table presents revenue for the company and its operating segments 

    companion animal group revenue for cag increased 575 million or 18 to 3844 million from 3269 million in the same period of the prior year this increase resulted primarily from sales of instruments and consumables and to a lesser degree rapid assay products laboratory and consulting services and pharmaceutical products the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 118 million or 4 to the increase in cag revenue 

the increase in sales of our instruments and consumables an increase of 338 million or 24 was due to increased sales of the lasercyte ® hematology system which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2002 partially offset by lower sales of qbc ® vetautoread ™ systems and increased sales of vettest ® slides and to a lesser extent lasercyte ® tubes partially offset by reduced sales of qbc ® vetautoread ™ tubes resulting from the replacement of qbc ® vetautoread ™ systems by lasercyte ® systems the overall increase in sales of instrument consumables was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the impact of reductions in distributors’ inventory levels in 2002 higher volume outside the us and increased domestic cliniclevel sales 

the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of 125 million or 18 was due to increased domestic cliniclevel sales of canine products and to a lesser degree feline products higher average unit prices the impact of reductions in distributors’ inventory levels in 2002 and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the increased sales volume was due in part to the apparent temporary difficulty of one of our competitors in supplying certain competitive products to the market in january 2004 this competitor announced that it had reentered the heartworm market in addition another competitor announced that it had entered the heartworm market 

shipments to distributors of our instrument consumables and rapid assay products during 2002 were significantly reduced by the company as part of a plan to reduce product inventories held by distributors the reduced shipments during 2002 create a favorable yeartoyear comparison for revenue growth rates for 2003 

the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services an increase of 82 million or 9 resulted primarily from higher volume primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in the uk and australia the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us and favorable pricing partially offset by the termination of the veterinary referral business 

the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products an increase of 18 million or 35 resulted from the commencement of sales of a product licensed to a third party and to a lesser extent growth of existing products 

  water revenue for water increased 50 million or 12 to 469 million from 420 million for the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume of watertesting products and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 18 million or 4 to the increase in water revenue 

  food diagnostics group revenue for fdg increased 08 million or 2 to 446 million from 438 million for the same period of the prior year the increase was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 35 million or 8 to the increase in fdg revenue 

an increase in sales of production animal diagnostics an increase of 11 million or 4 resulted from the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us these increases were partially offset by lower average unit prices and sales volume 

a decrease in sales of dairytesting products a decrease of 03 million or 2 was attributable to lower unit sales volume offset partially by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us 

gross profit   total company gross profit for the total company increased 376 million or 20 to 2303 million from 1927 million for the same period in the prior year as a percentage of total company revenue gross profit increased to 48 in 2003 from 47 in 2002 the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the company and its operating segments 

 24 

  companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 329 million or 23 to 1756 million from 1427 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to a lesser extent to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of cag revenue gross profit increased to 46 from 44 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to greater relative sales of rapid assay products and the 2003 termination of a lowmargin veterinary referral business productivity improvements across cag product lines in service and distribution operations the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses reduced amortization of vettest ® instruments in our rental and tradeup programs as units became fully amortized and increased average unit prices of rapid assay products and laboratory services these increases were partially offset by higher sales of our lower gross margin lasercyte ® hematology instrument and by the temporarily higher cost of vettest ® slides purchased in 2002 and sold in 2003 as a result of the 2002 renegotiation of our vettest ® slide supply agreement with ortho 

  water gross profit for water increased 29 million or 10 to 315 million from 286 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of water revenue gross profit decreased to 67 from 68 for the same period in the prior year the decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to higher royalty expenses the net impact of currency exchange and exchange contract losses unfavorable manufacturing variances and an unfavorable product mix of higher sales of lower margin accessories 

  food diagnostics group gross profit for fdg increased 18 million or 9 to 232 million from 214 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of fdg revenue gross profit increased to 52 from 49 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reduced inventory writedowns in 2003 compared to those recognized in the same period in 2002 primarily on an instrument and related components sold by the dairy business 

operating expenses   total company total company operating expenses increased 230 million to 1499 million from 1269 million for the same period of the prior year as a percentage of revenues operating expenses remained flat at 31 the following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the company and its operating segments 

    companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 237 million or 25 to 1204 million from 967 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 28 127 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 75 million increase in other expense a 9 19 million increase in research and development expense and a 6 17 million increase in general and administrative expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnel and marketing program costs increased costs to support the rampup in lasercyte ® sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencydenominated expenses 

the increase in other expense is primarily due to a 74 million charge for the writedown of production equipment purchased for the manufacture of consumables for use in an alternative clinical chemistry system as described above 

the increase in research and development expense resulted from increased staffing the increase in administrative expenses reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and an increase in bad debt provisions offset partially by the elimination of certain expenses related to legal matters that concluded in 2002 

  water operating expenses for water increased 03 million or 3 to 105 million from 102 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 21 09 million increase in sales and marketing expense and an 11 02 million increase in research and development expense partly offset by a 08 million reduction in other expense the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to compensation and benefits associated with additional personnel the decrease in other expense reflects the absence of certain nonrecurring expenses that were recognized in 2002 associated with a writeoff of intangible assets and litigation that concluded in 2002 

  food diagnostics group operating expenses for fdg increased 19 million or 14 to 156 million from 137 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 23 14 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 17 07 million increase in general and administrative expense and a 16 06 million increase in research and development expense partly offset by a 08 million increase in other income the increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount and from expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the china joint venture see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the increase in general and administrative expense reflects an increase in administrative support expenses outside of the us including support of the china joint venture and higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions the increase in research and development expense was due to new product development efforts primarily related to products for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies the increase in other income was primarily due to a reduction in an accrual related to a thirdparty claim 

  other operating expenses for 2003 decreased 29 million or 46 to 34 million from 63 million for the same period of the prior year the decrease resulted primarily from 34 million in nonrecurring benefits provided in 2002 in connection with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer in january 2002 partly offset by corporate research and development hiring costs incurred in 2003 

interest income net interest income was 29 million for 2003 compared with 30 million during 2002 the decrease was due to lower effective interest rates and the receipt in 2002 of 03 million in interest on a domestic tax refund the decrease was partially offset by interest earned on higher invested cash balances 

provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 315 for 2003 compared with 340 for 2002 the decrease in the effective rate is due to ongoing domestic and international tax planning initiatives revisions to prior year international tax estimates and the charge to writedown fixed assets discussed above occurring in a hightax jurisdiction the writedown reduced the effective tax rate by 05 

recent accounting pronouncements in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board •fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51” “fin 46r” fin 46r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights “variable interest entities” and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the variable interest entity this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either 1 the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or 2 the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties in addition fin 46r requires additional related disclosures certain disclosure provisions of fin 46r apply to all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 the consolidation provisions apply to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date and the remaining provisions with the exception of interest in special purpose entities apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march 15 2004 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 application for interest in special purpose entities is required for periods after december 15 2003 the adoption of fin 46r had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab no 104” which replaces sab no 101 this staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance included in topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations the principal revisions relate to the rescission of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in us generally accepted accounting principles this staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document issued in conjunction with topic 13 selected portions of that document have been incorporated into topic 13 sab no 104 also rescinds the accounting guidance in sab no 101 related to multipleelement arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas no 123 and supersedes accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of sharebased payments is no longer an alternative sfas no 123r is effective for all stockbased awards granted on or after july 1 2005 in addition companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123 we plan to use the modified prospective application method and to adopt the standard on july 1 2005 we are currently studying sfas no 123r and believe we will recognize approximately 80 million in pretax expense for the year ended december 31 2005 related to this standard 

liquidity and capital resources we fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had 1373 million and 2207 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments respectively and working capital of 2016 million and 2702 million respectively as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we also had longterm investments primarily in municipal bonds of 197 million and 351 million respectively as of december 31 2004 and 2003 we had total cash shortterm investments and longterm investments of 1570 million and 2558 million respectively 

effective january 1 2003 we entered into a workers’ compensation insurance policy for us employees under which we retain the first 025 million in claim liability per incident and up to specific limits based on payroll in claim liability in the aggregate we renewed this workers’ compensation policy effective january 1 2004 and entered into a similar workers’ compensation policy effective january 1 2005 we are liable for up to 30 million and 14 million in aggregate claim liability for 2004 and 2003 respectively and estimate that we will be liable for up to 25 million for 2005 we have recorded our estimated claim liability as of december 31 2004 and 2003 based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims the insurance company administers and pays these claims and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion of these claims the insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we issued a 11 million letter of credit to the insurance company as security for these claims as of december 31 2004 and agreed to issue a 05 million letter of credit for 2004 for our 2005 policy 

we purchased approximately 291 million in fixed assets and 26 million in rental instruments sold under recourse during the year ended december 31 2004 principally related to the cag segment our total capital budget for 2005 is approximately 280 million research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for 2005 is expected to be slightly lower than 2004 levels as we will record relatively higher proportion of our revenues from our laboratory services business which does not incur significant research and development expenses under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments slides for our vettest ® instruments and certain raw materials at december 31 2004 we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately 647 million of products in 2005 in 2004 we utilized cash of 539 million to acquire vet med lab bommeli a laboratory in columbus ohio and a production animal diagnostics company in new york 

cash provided by operating activities was 954 million during 2004 cash of 82 million was generated from the income tax benefit obtained due to the exercise of nonqualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options noncash expense of 46 million was recorded from the provision for deferred income taxes primarily due to accelerated depreciation cash of 58 million was used to pay vendor payables primarily due to ortho for vettest ® slides that were received in 2003 cash of 52 million was used to increase accounts receivable due to higher sales cash of 54 million was used by a decrease in accruals due primarily to the settlement of a thirdparty claim 

during 1999 and 2000 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions in october 2003 the board authorized the purchase of an additional 2000000 shares of common stock and in october 2004 the board of directors increased the authorization by an additional 2000000 shares of common stock during 2004 we repurchased approximately 2413000 shares of our common stock for 1288 million at an average price of 5337 per share as of december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 11955000 9541000 and 8614000 cumulative shares respectively had been repurchased under these programs during 2004 and 2003 the company received approximately 1000 and 133000 shares of stock respectively which were owned by the holder for greater than six months in payment for the exercise price of stock options the shares of stock had a fair market value of 01 million and 49 million respectively see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are required to make the following payments in the years below 

  we believe that current cash shortterm investments longterm investments and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital purchase requirements 

future operating results the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

  idexx’s future growth and profitability depends on several factors 

the future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies including 

     however we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability 

  idexx’s markets are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change 

we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies some of our competitors and potential competitors including large pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

  idexx’s products and services are subject to various government regulations 

in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture “usda” us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale our watertesting products must be approved by the epa before they can be used by customers in the us as a part of a waterquality monitoring program required by the epa our pharmaceutical and dairytesting products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap ® betalactam dairytesting products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residuetesting products were 157 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2004 

commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda to obtain such approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical manufacturing and other data to the fda regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture labeling storage record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products failure to obtain or delays in obtaining fda approval for new pharmaceutical products would have a negative impact on our future growth 

  changes in veterinary medical practices could negatively affect operating results 

the market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  idexx’s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies 

we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources 

we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore may not be available from other sources these products include our vettest ® chemistry qbc ® vetautoread™ hematology vetlyte ® electrolyte and vetstat™ blood gas analyzers and related consumables digital radiography systems active ingredients for pharmaceutical products including navigator ® paste and certain components of our snap ® rapid assay devices watertesting products and lasercyte ® systems if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the slides sold for use in our vettest ® instruments are purchased under an agreement with ortho at fixed prices under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of 1318 million of slides through 2010 to the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides we may incur losses in the future under this agreement to the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers our profits on slide sales could decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices 

  idexx’s biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture 

many of our products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials limits the precision of specifications for these materials which creates greater risk in the manufacturing process we attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by utilizing multiple vendors manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate characteristics however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  idexx’s sales are dependent on distributor purchasing patterns 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors because significant product sales are made to a limited number of customers unanticipated changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results our financial performance therefore is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 

  international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx’s total revenue 

in 2004 32 of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period in addition many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured sourced or both in the us and our costs are incurred in us dollars we utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure however an appreciation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our gross margins 

  the loss of our president chief executive officer and chairman could adversely affect our business 

we rely on the management and leadership of jonathan w ayers our president chief executive officer and chairman we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for mr ayers the loss of mr ayers could have a material impact on our business 

  we could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility which if occurs could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us 

the market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects in the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities we may be the target of similar litigation in the future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  if our quarterly results of operations fluctuate this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline resulting in losses to you 

our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors including seasonality of certain product lines changes in our accounting estimates the impact of acquisitions timing of distributor purchases product launches research and development expenditures litigation and claimrelated expenditures changes in competitors’ product offerings and other matters similarly our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors many of which are beyond our control if our operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods our stock price may fall 

  future operating results could be materially affected by the resolution of various uncertain taxpositions and adversely affected by potential changes to tax incentives 

in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities management believes that it has adequately accrued for all potential tax liabilities and although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals additionally we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions some of which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2005 if we are unable to renew such incentives the expiration of these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate subsidiaries in 16 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure see note 2m to our consolidated financial statements 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with a duration of less than 18 months gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods our hedging strategy provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following twelve months accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle as of december 31 2004 the company had 29 million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 15 million in taxes 

our currency rate exposure at december 31 2004 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency based on our overall currency rate exposure excluding unrealized losses of 43 million at december 31 2004 and 44 million at december 31 2003 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately 23 million for 2005 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar from december 31 2003 would have reduced operating income for 2004 by approximately 22 million a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december 31 2004 would increase operating income by approximately 23 million in 2005 a 10 weakening of the us dollar from december 31 2003 would have increased operating income by approximately 22 million in 2004 as of december 31 2004 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would reduce operating income by approximately 93 million in 2005 compared to 81 million in 2004 and the effects of a 10 weakening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would increase operating income by approximately 93 million in 2005 compared to 81 million in 2004

products and services we operate primarily through three business segments products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as our companion animal group “cag” water quality products “water” and products and services for production animal health and dairy quality which we refer to as the food diagnostics group “fdg” see note 17 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for financial information about our business segments including geographic information 

companion animal group   rapid assays we provide a broad range of singleuse hand held test kits that allow quick in most cases less than ten minutes accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention if required our principal singleuse tests are sold under the snap® name and include a feline combination test the snap® combo fiv antibodyfelv antigen test which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus “fiv” which is similar to the human aids virus and feline leukemia virus “felv” a canine combination test the snap® 3dx® which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm and a canine heartwormonly test sales of heartworm tests are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek® name which are used by larger clinics and independent laboratories to test multiple samples petchek® tests offer accuracy ease of use and cost advantages to highvolume customers we currently sell petchek® tests for felv fiv and canine heartworm disease   instruments and consumables we currently market several instrument systems as well as associated consumable products for use in veterinary clinics these instruments include the following   blood chemistry  our vettest® blood chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions twentyone separate blood chemistry tests can be performed on the vettest® analyzer with up to 12 tests run in under six minutes after sample application commonly run tests include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase creatinine bun blood urea nitrogen and total protein we purchase all of the reagents used in the vettest® analyzer “dry chemistry slides ” or “vettest slides” from orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” a subsidiary of johnson  johnson see “businessproduction and supply” in october 2003 we entered into a new agreement with ortho under which we are developing a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on ortho’s dry slide technology and ortho will supply the slide consumables used in both the vettest analyzer and the new analyzer through 2018   hematology  in october 2002 we introduced the lasercyte® system a hematology system that uses laserflow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets we believe that the lasercyte® system is the only inclinic hematology system that provides veterinarians with a fivepart white blood cell differential and an absolute reticulocyte count which provides enhanced diagnostic capabilities to veterinarians we also sell the qbc® vetautoread™ hematology analyzer which is based on the becton dickinson qbc® autoread™ hematology system that is sold to physicians for human applications   electrolytes  our vetlyte® system measures three electrolytes – sodium potassium and chloride – to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration test results are available in less than one minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the vetlyte® analyzer or downloaded to the vettest® analyzer 3   quantitative hormone testing  the vettest® snap® reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones including thyroxine t4 and cortisol these measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases such as hyper and hypothyroidism cushing’s syndrome and addison’s disease samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our snap® device platform   computed radiography  we market and sell two computed radiography systems the idexxcr system which is appropriate for use in the veterinary clinic and the idexxcr compact system which is primarily used as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices such as equine practices our computed radiography systems generate digital radiograph images which replace traditional xray film use of digital radiographs eliminates the need for the film and processor hazardous chemicals and darkroom required for the production of film images we are currently involved in litigation with our supplier of computed radiography instruments see “production and supply” below   veterinary laboratory and consulting services we offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services in the us through facilities located in arizona california colorado georgia illinois kentucky maryland massachusetts new jersey ohio oregon and texas through subsidiaries located in the united kingdom japan and australia we offer commercial veterinary laboratory services to veterinary clinics located in those countries veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals additionally we provide specialized veterinary consultation telemedicine and advisory services including cardiology radiology internal medicine dermatology and ultrasound consulting these services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet from the veterinarians’ offices approximately 74 71 and 72 of the company’s revenues were derived from sales of rapid assays veterinary instruments and consumables and veterinary laboratory and consulting services within the cag segment in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively   information products and services we develop market and sell practice information management software systems that run key functions of veterinary clinics including scheduling billing and patient records management our systems also provide veterinarians with the ability to download laboratory results electronically from our veterinary reference laboratories directly into the patients’ medical records we believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software systems in the us with an installed base of more than 7500 of the approximately 25000 veterinary hospitals in north america we also provide software and hardware support and derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts   veterinary pharmaceuticals we develop market and sell novel therapeutics for the veterinary market in december 2000 we introduced acarexx® 01 ivermectin otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats our first drug approved by the us food and drug administration “fda” in 2002 we commenced active marketing of pzi vet® an insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats under the fda’s regulatory discretion guidelines in november 2003 we introduced navigator® 32 nitazoxanide antiprotozoal oral paste a new treatment for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis epm epm is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system that can cause serious or even fatal neurological problems in horses we currently have a number of other products under development including a topical form of diclofenac a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for equine use and tilmicosin a longacting injectable form of the antibiotic tilmicosin for cats we have completed the safety and efficacy components of our new animal drug application “nada” for diclofenac and have submitted 4 information relating to manufacturing in response to questions from the fda we submitted all components in support of a nada for tilmicosin to the fda in the second quarter of 2003 

water our colilert® colilert18 and colisure® tests simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water these products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells our enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters our quantitray® products when used in conjunction with our colilert® colilert18 colisure® or enterolert™ products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather then a presenceabsence indication the colilert® colilert18 colisure® and quantitray® products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries in august 2000 we acquired genera technologies limited a ukbased company that develops and sells products for detection of cryptosporidia in water cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the united kingdom but is not regulated in other countries at this time approximately 10 of the company’s revenues were derived from sales of water testing products in each of 2003 2002 and 2001 

food diagnostics group   production animal services we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine producers significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and pseudorabies virus in pigs newcastle disease in poultry and johne’s disease and brucellosis in cattle we have developed a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease” we have submitted an application to the united states department of agriculture “usda” for approval of this test however there is no current testing program in the us that requires use of rapid tests of the kind that we manufacture and we do not know when or if the usda will implement any such program we also have submitted an application to the eu food safety commission seeking a license to sell this product in eu member countries   dairy testing our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the snap® betalactam test dairy producers and processors use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk and government and food quality managers use them for ongoing surveillance in march 2003 we entered into an agreement with the fda under which we agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap® betalactam products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were 161 million in 2003 approximately 9 11 and 10 of the company’s revenues were derived from sales of production animal and dairy products and services in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 5

production and supply vettest® analyzers are manufactured for us by tokyo parts industrial company ltd under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew vettest® slides are supplied exclusively by ortho under supply agreements with ortho the “ortho agreements” we are required to purchase all of our requirements for vettest® slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest® slides through 2010 the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2018 the qbc®vetautoread™ system is manufactured for us by becton dickinson under a development and distribution agreement that requires becton dickinson to supply analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010 becton dickinson is the sole source of these analyzers and reagents we purchase certain other products raw materials and components from only one source these include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products including navigator® computed radiography systems and certain components used in our snap® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte® systems the loss of some of these sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company the supplier of our computed radiography systems has informed us that it believes we are in breach of our supply agreement we believe we have complied fully with that agreement and we have filed suit against that supplier seeking declaratory judgment from the court that we are not in breach of the agreement an order from the court compelling the supplier to honor our agreement and damages for certain breaches of the agreement by the supplier the supplier has asserted counterclaims against us alleging among other things breaches of implied covenants in the contract we believe we have strong defenses to these counterclaims and intend to contest them vigorously an adverse result in this litigation could result in loss of supply of our computed radiography instruments andor a requirement that we pay damages to the supplier revenue from this product line was 13 million in 2003 we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales 

competition we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain patent protection and obtain adequate capital resources we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures some of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below  7

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

business overview we operate primarily through three business segments the companion animal group “cag” water testing business “water” and the food diagnostics group “fdg” cag comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services rapid assays instruments instrument consumables and laboratory and consulting services veterinary pharmaceuticals and veterinary information products and services water develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water fdg develops designs manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and food other encompasses activities that are not included in our three business segments and is comprised primarily of corporate research and development a ceo succession charge and interest income we have conformed the financial information about segments for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2003 previously we reported two operating segments 12 the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business   companion animal group our cag segment accounted for approximately 81 of our sales in 2003 and is therefore our most significant business the largest product lines within our cag segment by percentage of revenue in 2003 are  other consists primarily of practice information management software and services and pharmaceutical products to date revenues from sales of pharmaceutical products have not been substantial however we are investing significantly in a pipeline of companion animal pharmaceutical products if we are successful in developing obtaining fda approval for and marketing these products we believe that sales of pharmaceutical products will become a more material component of cag sales in the future by offering to companion animal veterinarians a broad range and an integrated set of proprietary diagnostic products and services therapeutics and practice management computer systems we believe we have developed a strong customer franchise providing us a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings our complementary products and services give us scale in sales and distribution in this market and permit us to offer programs such as practice developer™ a loyalty program that allows clinics to earn points with purchases depending on the number of product categories they purchase from and the volume of those purchases and to apply earned points toward among other things the purchase of a variety of idexx products and services by offering both pointofcare diagnostics for use in the clinic and outside laboratory services we are able to develop integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and laboratory testing in addition by integrating our practice management software systems with our instruments and with our reference laboratories we enhance the veterinary practices of our customers by facilitating the flow of medical information in the clinic in the us we sell instrument consumables rapid assays and pharmaceuticals through distributors and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors rather than sales to veterinarians the endusers because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product therefore we closely track sales of these products by our distributors to the clinics “cliniclevel sales” which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products in the discussion of results below we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced positively or negatively by changes in distributor inventories   instruments and instrument consumables  our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments called idexx vetlab® that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments during the early stage of an instrument life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent on our ability both to develop and sell new instruments with enhanced diagnostic capabilities and to maximize customer utilization of those instruments which creates more consumables sales we have a large installed base of vettest® chemistry analyzers and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales although we continue to place instruments through sales and through rental and other programs as a result the success of this product line is partially dependent on 13 increased customer utilization of those instruments toward that end we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes we purchase the consumables used in vettest® chemistry analyzers from ortho in october 2003 we entered into a new supply agreement with ortho under which we are developing and will introduce a nextgeneration chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the ortho dryslide technology and ortho will supply us with the slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest® chemistry analyzer the new agreement provides us with a source of dryslide consumables through 2018 at an expected improved cost over the term of the agreement the new agreement does not increase over the prior agreement the minimum unit volume of slides we are required to purchase from ortho over the term of the agreement as a result of this new agreement we discontinued certain internal development activities relating to an alternative nextgeneration clinical chemistry instrument we incurred a noncash pretax charge in the quarter ended december 31 2003 of approximately 74 million for the impairment of manufacturing equipment purchased for the production of consumables for use in this alternative instrument in the fourth quarter of 2002 we introduced our new hematology analyzer the lasercyte® system which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform the qbc® vetautoread™ system our success in growing hematology revenues over the next several years will depend upon our ability to sell lasercyte® instruments although we intend to continue to sell the qbc® vetautoread™ system we do not intend to rent lasercyte® instruments in the foreseeable future at earlier stages in the life cycle of this product a substantial portion of lasercyte® placements will be made at veterinary clinics that already own our qbc® vetautoread™ instruments as a result net consumables sales are not likely to grow significantly in the near future as we expect the increase in lasercyte® consumable sales to be largely offset by declines in sales of qbc® vetautoread™ consumables however we believe that the enhanced diagnostic capabilities of the lasercyte® system will lead veterinarians to perform more inclinic hematology testing which will increase consumables sales as our installed base of lasercyte® systems increases in addition we expect the gross margin percentage of lasercyte® consumables to exceed the gross margin percentage of the qbc® vetautoread™ consumables with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability quality of diagnostic information reliability and customer service our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy in addition our inclinic instrumentation competes with outside laboratory services for similar diagnostic information and such services are typically offered at a lower cost therefore our success also depends on our ability to market the relative attractiveness of inclinic diagnostic testing versus less convenient and timely but lower priced laboratory testing   laboratory services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service and technology revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers in the third quarter of 2003 we acquired a laboratory in kentucky in the fourth quarter of 2003 we opened a new laboratory in atlanta and in the first quarter of 2004 we acquired a laboratory in columbus ohio profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements   rapid assays  our rapid assay business comprises singleuse kits for inclinic testing and microwellbased kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our two principal product lines are canine heartworm products and the snap® fiv antibodyfelv antigen combination test our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which we believe do not include a similar level of support we augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 14   water our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration international sales of water testing products represented 37 of total water product sales in 2003 and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe   food diagnostics group   production animal services  we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry cattle and swine diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can be subject to fluctuation in 2003 approximately 70 of our sales in this business was international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally   dairy testing  our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance sales of dairy testing products have declined over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market to increase sales of dairy testing products we will need to increase penetration in geographies outside the united states and in the farm segment of the dairy market 

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations restructuring and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements   inventory our inventories include material labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on our results of operations as of december 31 2003 our inventories included 72 million of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte® hematology instrument which we began shipping to customers in fourth quarter of 15 2002 in addition we have firm purchase commitments for an additional 35 million we expect to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments however if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the associated inventory   valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following  when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above we measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to 618 million as of december 31 2003 consisting of 252 million related to veterinary laboratories of which 246 million represents goodwill 173 million related to water test products of which 149 million represents goodwill 160 million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products of which 137 million represents goodwill and 33 million of other of which 18 million represents goodwill in 2002 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 and as a result we ceased to amortize goodwill but continued to amortize all other intangibles we had recorded approximately 50 million of goodwill amortization on these amounts during the year ended december 31 2001 and would have recorded approximately 45 million of goodwill amortization during the same periods in 2003 and 2002 if the existing standards had been continued in addition we recorded 05 million 06 million and 15 million of other intangible amortization during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively in lieu of goodwill amortization we were required to perform annual impairment reviews of our goodwill no impairment was found as a result of either our initial impairment review or our 2003 and 2002 yearend reviews   revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the seller’s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured  16  when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under eitf 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” accordingly the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers the deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or tradein rights we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years revenue reductions are finalized on a quarterly basis for most programs upon issuance of credits or free or discounted products for the snapupthesavings™ program estimates of future customer credits are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of credits to customers for our practice developer™ volume discount program we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment additional allowances might be required   income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable respectively and a deferred tax liability or asset as the case may be for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we have recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to state and international net operating loss carryforwards and certain other unrealizable international deferred tax assets while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us as of december 31 2003 we had unremitted earnings in subsidiaries outside the us of 604 million on which no us taxes have been provided our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when taxeffective to do so it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings 17   warranty reserves we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates which are based on historical data and engineering estimates where applicable revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we had accrued 37 million and 03 million for estimated warranty expense respectively warranty expense was 40 million 04 million and 03 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in warranty accrual and expense is due to our launch of the lasercyte® system in the fourth quarter of 2002 we expect sales of lasercyte® will continue to increase in 2004 and beyond we will charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte® sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates our cost of sales of lasercyte® systems would increase   estimates for certain claims we purchase insurance policies annually for individual and aggregate amounts of employee health insurance claims we are selfinsured for up to 01 million per claim and up to an aggregate limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month which is estimated to be 10 million annually we estimate our liability for employee health claims based on individual and aggregate coverage our monthly claims experience the number of employees enrolled in the program and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported we purchase workers’ compensation insurance policies annually prior to january 1 2003 we were fully insured for workers’ compensation claims beginning january 1 2003 we purchased an insurance policy where we are liable for the first 025 million in claims per occurrence and up to an aggregate limit based on payroll which is estimated to be 14 million for 2003 we renewed this policy effective january 1 2004 we estimate our liability for workers’ compensation claims based on the insurance policy limits claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to litigate andor settle the claims periodically we are notified that a claim is being made against us we evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of each claim if warranted we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly 

results of operations twelve months ended december 31 2003 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2002 revenue   total company revenue for the total company increased 633 million or 15 to 4760 million from 4127 million in the same period of the prior year the following table presents revenue for the company and its operating segments  18   companion animal group revenue for cag increased 575 million or 18 to 3844 million from 3269 million in the same period of the prior year this increase resulted primarily from sales of instruments rapid assay products instrument consumables laboratory services pharmaceutical products and veterinary practice management software and services the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 118 million or 4 to the increase in cag revenue the increase in sales of instruments an increase of approximately 185 million or 127 was due primarily to increased sales of the lasercyte® hematology system which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2002 partially offset by lower sales of qbc® vetautoread ™ systems the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of approximately 132 million or 18 was due to increased domestic cliniclevel sales of canine products and to a lesser degree feline products higher average unit prices the impact of reductions in distributors’ inventory levels in 2002 and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the increased sales volume was due in part to the apparent temporary difficulty of one of our competitors in supplying certain competitive products to the market in january 2004 this competitor announced that it had reentered the heartworm market in addition another competitor announced that it has entered the heartworm market as a result we believe that competition in the heartworm market will increase in 2004 the increase in sales of instrument consumables an increase of approximately 131 million or 12 was due primarily to increased sales of vettest® slides and to a lesser extent lasercyte® tubes partially offset by reduced sales of qbc® vetautoread ™ tubes resulting from the replacement of qbc® vetautoread ™ systems by lasercyte® systems the overall increase in sales of instrument consumables was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the impact of reductions in distributors’ inventory levels in 2002 higher volume outside the us and increased domestic cliniclevel sales shipments to distributors of our consumables and rapid assay products during 2002 were significantly reduced by the company as part of a plan to reduce product inventories held by distributors the reduced shipments during 2002 create a favorable yeartoyear comparison that causes reported growth in 2003 to exceed the company’s estimates of the underlying cliniclevel growth for these products the increase in sales of laboratory services an increase of approximately 119 million or 15 resulted primarily from higher volume primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in the uk and australia the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us and favorable pricing the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products an increase of approximately 18 million or 35 resulted from sales of a product licensed to a third party and to a lesser extent growth of existing products the increase in sales of veterinary practice management software and services an increase of approximately 06 million or 3 resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware sales   water revenue for water increased 50 million or 12 to 469 million from 420 million for the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume of water testing products and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 18 million or 4 to the increase in water revenue   food diagnostics group revenue for fdg increased 08 million or 2 to 446 million from 438 million for the same period of the prior year the increase was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 35 million or 8 to the increase in fdg revenue the increase in sales of production animal diagnostics an increase of approximately 11 million or 4 resulted from the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us these increases were partially offset by lower average unit prices and sales volume 19 the decrease in sales of dairy testing products a decrease of approximately 03 million or 2 was attributable to lower unit sales volume offset partially by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us gross profit   total company gross profit for the total company increased 376 million or 20 to 2303 million from 1927 million for the same period in the prior year as a percentage of total company revenue gross profit increased to 48 in 2003 from 47 in 2002 the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the company and its operating segments    companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 329 million or 23 to 1756 million from 1427 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines and to a lesser extent to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of cag revenue gross profit increased to 46 from 44 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to greater relative sales of rapid assay products and the 2003 termination of a low margin veterinary referral business productivity improvements across cag product lines in service and distribution operations the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses reduced amortization of vettest® instruments in our rental and tradeup programs as units become fully amortized and increased average unit prices of rapid assay products and laboratory services these increases were partially offset by higher sales of our lower gross margin lasercyte® hematology instrument and by the higher cost of vettest® slides purchased in 2002 and sold in 2003 as a result of the 2002 renegotiation of our vettest® slide supply agreement with ortho vettest® slides purchased in 2002 were sold as of the end of the third quarter of 2003 therefore beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 the associated cost of sales was reduced to a level more comparable with the first nine months of 2002   water gross profit for water increased 29 million or 10 to 315 million from 286 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of water revenue gross profit decreased to 67 from 68 for the same period in the prior year the decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to higher royalty expenses the net impact of currency exchange and exchange contract losses unfavorable manufacturing variances and an unfavorable product mix of higher sales of lower margin accessories   food diagnostics group gross profit for fdg increased 18 million or 9 to 232 million from 214 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of fdg revenue gross profit increased to 52 from 49 for the same period in the prior year the increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reduced inventory writedowns in 2003 compared to those recognized in the same period in 2002 primarily on an instrument and related components sold by the dairy business 20 operating expenses   total company total company operating expenses increased 230 million to 1499 from 1269 million for the same period of the prior year as a percentage of revenues operating expenses remained flat at 31 the following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the company and its operating segments     companion animal group operating expenses for cag increased 237 million or 25 to 1204 million from 967 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 28 approximately 127 million increase in sales and marketing expense a 75 million increase in other expense a 9 approximately 19 million increase in research and development expense and a 6 approximately 17 million increase in general and administrative expense the increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted primarily from increased personnel and marketing program costs increased costs to support the ramp up in lasercyte® sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses the increase in other expense is primarily due to a 74 million charge for the writedown of production equipment purchased for the manufacture of consumables for use in an alternative clinical chemistry system in october 2003 we extended our relationship with ortho which supplies the vettest slides we committed to develop a next generation clinical chemistry system based on ortho’s dry slide technology and discontinued efforts to develop the alternative system the increase in research and development expense results from increased staffing the increase in administrative expenses reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and an increase in bad debt provisions offset partially by the elimination of certain expenses related to legal matters that concluded in 2002   water operating expenses for water increased 03 million or 3 to 105 million from 102 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 21 approximately 09 million increase in sales and marketing expenses and an 11 approximately 02 million increase in research and development expenses partly offset by a 08 million reduction in other expenses the increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount the increase in research and development expenses was due to new product development efforts the decrease in other expenses reflects the absence of certain nonrecurring expenses that were recognized in 2002 associated with a writeoff of intangible assets and litigation that concluded in 2002   food diagnostics group operating expenses for fdg increased 19 million or 14 to 156 million from 137 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to a 23 approximately 14 million increase in sales and marketing expenses a 17 07 million increase in administrative expenses and a 16 06 million increase in research and development expenses partly offset by a 08 million increase in other income the increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount and from expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the china joint venture see note 14 to 21 the consolidated financial statements the increase in administrative expenses reflects an increase in administrative support expenses outside of the us including support of the china joint venture and higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions the increase in research and development expenses was due to new product development efforts primarily related to products for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies the increase in other income was primarily due to a favorable revision of an estimate of royalty obligations under a technology license   other operating expenses for 2003 decreased 29 million or 46 to 34 million from 63 million for the same period in period in the year the decrease resulted primarily from 34 million in nonrecurring benefits provided in 2002 in connection with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer in january 2002 partly offset by corporate research and development hiring costs incurred in 2003 interest income net interest income was 29 million for 2003 compared with 30 million during 2002 the decrease was due to lower effective interest rates and the receipt in 2002 of 03 million in interest on a domestic tax refund the decrease was partially offset by interest earned on higher invested cash balances provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 315 for 2003 compared with 340 for 2002 the decrease in the effective rate is due to ongoing domestic and international tax planning initiatives revisions to prior year international tax estimates and the charge to writedown fixed assets discussed above occurring in a hightax jurisdiction the writedown reduced the effective tax rate by 05 twelve months ended december 31 2002 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2001 revenue   total company revenue for the total company increased 266 million or 7 to 4127 million from 3861 million in the same period of the prior year the following table presents revenue for the company and its operating segments    companion animal group revenue for cag increased 188 million or 6 to 3269 million from 3080 million in the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from sales of laboratory services and instrument consumables and to a lesser extent rapid assay products veterinary practice management software and services and instruments these increases were partially offset by reduced sales of pharmaceutical products the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the us contributed an aggregate of 23 million or 1 to the increase cag revenue the increase in sales of laboratory services an increase of approximately 73 million or 10 resulted primarily from higher volume worldwide and to a lesser extent price increases in the us and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us the increase in sales of instrument consumables an increase of approximately 62 million or 6 resulted primarily from increased unit sales of vettest® slides worldwide and to a lesser extent the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside of the us the increase in revenues was positively impacted by depressed 2001 sales that resulted from a late 2000 marketing program that pulled sales into 2000 revenues were negatively impacted due to a decrease in distributor inventories of instrument consumables in 2002 22 the increase in sales of rapid assay products an increase of approximately 31 million or 5 resulted primarily from increased cliniclevel sales of canine heartworm and feline test kits offset primarily by the negative impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and increased accruals on sales of canine heartworm test kits due to higher customer participation in a volume rebate program the increase in sales of veterinary practice management software and services an increase of approximately 14 million or 7 resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware upgrade sales the increase in sales of instruments an increase of approximately 11 million or 8 was due to sales of lasercyte® systems and to a lesser extent vettest® systems partially offset by reduced sales of our qbc® vetautoread™ hematology instrument primarily due to a shift in marketing and customer focus to the lasercyte® system the decrease in sales of pharmaceutical products a decrease of 03 million or 6 was due to a decline in sales of the company’s acarexx® feline ear mite treatment offset partially by increased sales of pzi vet® insulin which was launched on a commercial basis in the fourth quarter of 2002   water revenue for water increased 37 million or 10 to 420 million from 383 million for the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from increased sales volume in europe and the americas and to a lesser extent price increases in the us   food diagnostics group revenue for fdg increased 41 million or 10 to 438 million from 397 million for the same period of the prior year the increase was primarily due to increased sales of production animal diagnostics offset partially by a decrease in sales of dairy testing products the increase in sales of production animal diagnostics an increase of approximately 49 million or 22 resulted primarily from higher unit sales of livestock products and to a lesser extent price increases on livestock products and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside of the us approximately half of the increased sales of livestock products were the result of government sponsored testing initiatives in germany the decrease in sales of dairy testing products a decrease of approximately 08 million or 5 was primarily attributable to lower unit sales volume as a result of increased competition gross profit   total company gross profit for the total company increased 94 million or 5 to 1927 million from 1833 million for the same period in the prior yearas a percentage of total company revenue gross profit remained flat at 47the following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the company and its operating segments    companion animal group gross profit for cag increased 49 million or 4 to 1427 million from 1378 million in the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines partially offset by a reduction in the gross profit percentage as a percentage of cag revenue gross profit declined from 45 for the same period in the prior year to 44 the decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to foreign exchange hedge contract losses in 2002 compared to gains in 2001 increased amortization due to additional placements of vettest® instruments in our rental and tradeup programs and a net unfavorable change in manufacturing variances these factors were offset partially by productivity improvements across cag product lines partly due to increased revenue spread against the fixed cost portion of our expense base 23 the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro and british pound on sales denominated in those currencies reversal of an accrual for potential loss on our vettest® slide supply agreement with ortho as a result of an amendment to our supply agreement in october 2002 that reduced our minimum purchase obligations under the agreement and higher prices primarily on laboratory services and feline test kits   water gross profit for water increased 25 million or 9 to 286 million from 261 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased sales volume as a percentage of water revenue gross profit was unchanged at 68 gross profit percentage benefited from favorable manufacturing variances and reduced inventory writedowns higher prices and the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro and british pound on revenue these increases were offset by higher distribution costs   food diagnostics group gross profit for fdg increased 20 million or 10 to 214 million from 194 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased sales volume in production animal diagnostics as a percentage of fdg revenue gross profit was unchanged at 49 gross profit percentage benefited from a favorable mix of higher margin poultry and livestock products reduced distribution and freight costs higher prices for livestock products and the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro and british pound on revenue these increases were offset by higher inventory writedowns of certain dairy and production animal diagnostic products and royalty accruals on certain livestock products operating expenses   total company total company operating expenses increased 01 million to 1269 from 1268 million for the same period of the prior year as a percentage of revenues operating expenses declined to 31 from 33 the following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the company and its operating segments     companion animal group operating expenses for cag decreased 45 million or 4 to 967 million from 1012 million in the same period of the prior year this decrease resulted primarily from the impact of adoption of sfas no 142 under which the company ceased amortizing goodwill a reduction in severance and related costs a reduction in marketing expense associated with feline diagnostic products due to a directtoconsumer marketing campaign in 2001 a reduction in bad debt expense and savings from the consolidation of our pharmaceuticals and companion animal diagnostics sales forces these decreases were offset partially by increased spending on sales and marketing including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange to support higher sales volumes litigation spending net of a settlement received related to the company’s patent infringement lawsuit against abaxis inc and sa scientific inc and increased research and development expenses   water operating expenses for water increased 04 million or 4 to 102 million from 98 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was attributable to the writeoff of nonperforming intangible assets associated with the 2000 acquisition of genera technologies limited litigation that concluded in 2002 and new product development efforts offset partially by the impact of adoption of sfas no 142 and a reduction in bad debt expense 24   food diagnostics group operating expenses for fdg increased 07 million or 5 to 137 million from 131 million in the same period of the prior year the increase was primarily due to new product development efforts primarily related to products for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies increased marketing activities and headcount and an increase in administrative support expenses outside of the us these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt experience   other operating expenses for other which consist of 29 million in corporate research and development and 34 million in charges related to our chief executive officer succession increased 36 million to 63 million from 27 million in the same period of the prior year the increase resulted primarily from benefits provided in connection with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer in january 2002 under an employment agreement we were required to make certain payments to our former chief executive officer and provide certain benefits to him following his retirement and the succession to our new chief executive officer during 2002 we incurred charges under this agreement of 34 million of which 18 million was noncash interest income net interest income was 30 million for 2002 compared with 22 million during 2001 the increase was due to higher invested cash balances and the receipt of 03 million in interest on a domestic tax refund these increases were partially offset by lower effective interest rates provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 34 for 2002 compared with 36 for 2001 the reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the elimination of nondeductible goodwill associated with the adoption of sfas no 142 

recent accounting pronouncements in november 2002 the emerging issues task force “eitf” of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” reached consensus on eitf no 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” “eitf no 0021” eitf no 0021 addresses the accounting treatment for arrangements that provide for the delivery or performance of multiple products or services where the delivery of a product system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time eitf no 0021 requires the separation of the multiple deliverables that meet certain requirements into individual units of accounting that are accounted for separately under the appropriate authoritative accounting literature eitf no 0021 is applicable to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 the company adopted the provisions of eitf no 0021 effective january 2003 the adoption of eitf no 0021 had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in november 2002 the fasb issued fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34” “fin 45” fin 45 requires that a guarantor recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee fin 45 also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligation under certain guarantees it has issued the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements are effective for all guarantees outstanding regardless of when they were issued or modified for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 we have adopted the additional disclosure provisions of this statement required for the year ended december 31 2002 and the recognition provisions for the quarter ended march 31 2003 there were no impacts of the adoption of this statement in december 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51” “fin 46r” fin 46r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights “variable interest entities” and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the variable interest entity this new model for consolidation applies to 25 an entity in which either 1 the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or 2 the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties in addition fin 46r requires additional related disclosures certain disclosure provisions of fin 46r apply to all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 the consolidation provisions apply to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date and the remaining provisions with the exception of interest in special purpose entities apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march 15 2004 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 application for interest in special purpose entities is required for periods after december 15 2003 the adoption of fin 46r had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab no104” which replaces sab no 101 this staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance included in topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations the principal revisions relate to the rescission of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in us generally accepted accounting principles this staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document issued in conjunction with topic 13 selected portions of that document have been incorporated into topic 13 sab no 104 also rescinds the accounting guidance in sab no 101 related to multipleelement arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources we fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations at december 31 2003 and 2002 we had 2207 million and 1472 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments respectively and working capital of 2699 million and 2177 million respectively as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we also had longterm investments primarily in municipal bonds of 351 million and 156 million respectively as of december 31 2003 and 2002 we had total cash shortterm investments and longterm investments of 2558 million and 1628 million respectively effective january 1 2003 we entered into a workers’ compensation insurance policy where we retain the first 025 million in claim liability per incident and up to specific limits based on payroll in claim liability in the aggregate we renewed this workers’ compensation policy effective january 1 2004 we are liable for up to 14 million in aggregate claim liability for 2003 and estimate that we will be liable for up to 20 million for 2004 we have recorded our estimated claim liability as of december 31 2003 based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims the insurance company administers and pays these claims and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion of these claims the insurance company also provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits we issued a 05 million letter of credit to the insurance company as security for these claims as of december 31 2003 and agreed to issue an additional 06 million letter of credit for 2004 we purchased approximately 169 million in fixed assets and 27 million in other longterm assets during the year ended december 31 2003 principally related to the cag segment our total capital budget for 2004 is approximately 230 million research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for 2004 is expected to be consistent with 2003 levels under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments slides for our vettest® instruments and certain raw materials at december 31 2003 we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately 683 million of products in 2004 cash provided by operating activities was 1172 million during 2003 cash of 166 million was provided by an increase in accruals defined as accrued expenses accrued employee compensation and related expenses accrued taxes and accrued marketing and customer programs attributable primarily to increased liabilities for taxes compensation and related liabilities and warranty expense cash of 130 million was generated from the income tax benefit obtained due to the exercise of nonqualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options cash of 96 million was generated by an increase to accounts payable due primarily to the timing of quarterly shipments of vettest slides from ortho the noncash write down of manufacturing equipment 26 reduced our net income by 74 million and therefore is added back to cash generated from operations cash of 56 million was used by an increase in accounts receivable due to high sales volume during 1999 and 2000 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 10000000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions in october 2003 the board authorized the purchase of an additional 2000000 shares of common stock during 2003 we repurchased approximately 927000 shares of our common stock for 362 million as of december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 approximately 9541000 8614000 and 7614000 cumulative shares respectively had been repurchased under these programs during 2003 the company received approximately 133000 shares of stock which were owned by the holder for greater than six months in payment for the exercise price of stock options the shares of stock had a fair market value of 49 million see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements we are required to make the following payments in the years below   we believe that current cash shortterm investments longterm investments and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital purchase requirements 

future operating results the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report   idexx’s future growth depends on several factors the future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies including  27   idexx’s markets are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies some of our competitors and potential competitors including large pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do   idexx’s products and services are subject to various government regulations in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture “usda” us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they may be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the us or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap® betalactam dairy testing products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were 161 million in 2003 commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda to obtain such approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical manufacturing and other data to the fda regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture labeling storage record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products we have two animal pharmaceutical products in registration with the fda including a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for the treatment of lameness in horses and an injectible antibiotic for cats failure to obtain or delays in obtaining fda approval for these products would have a negative impact on our future growth   changes in veterinary medical practices could negatively affect operating results we believe that more than half of all veterinary diagnostic testing occurs in laboratories although we have a significant laboratory business our inclinic testing business is more material to our results of operations if testing by companion animal veterinarians generally were to shift towards increased laboratory testing and away from inclinic testing this shift could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases such a decline could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations   idexx’s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us we cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 28 in addition expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore may not be available from other sources these products include our vettest chemistry and qbc® vetautoread™ hematology analyzers and related consumables computed radiography systems active ingredients for pharmaceutical products including navigator® and certain components of our snap® rapid assay devices water testing products and lasercyte® systems if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the supplier of our computed radiography systems has informed us that it believes we are in breach of our supply agreement we believe we have complied fully with that agreement and we have filed suit against that supplier seeking declaratory judgment from the court that we are not in breach of the agreement an order from the court compelling the supplier to honor our agreement and damages for certain breaches of the agreement by the supplier the supplier has asserted counterclaims against us alleging among other things breaches of implied covenants in the contract we believe we have strong defenses to these counterclaims and intend to contest them vigorously an adverse result in this litigation could result in loss of supply of our computed radiography instruments andor a requirement that we pay damages to the supplier revenue from this product line was 13 million in 2003 the slides sold for use in our vettest® instruments are purchased under an agreement with ortho at fixed prices under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of 1704 million of slides through 2010 to the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides we may incur losses in the future under this agreement to the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers our profits on slide sales would decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices   idexx’s biologic products are complex and difficult to manufacture many of our products are biologics which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms such as antibodies cells and sera manufacturing biologic products is highly complex unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy such as most pharmaceuticals biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological materials difficulty in characterizing biological materials limits the precision of specifications for these materials which creates greater risk in the manufacturing process we attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by utilizing multiple vendors manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate characteristics however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to manufacture successfully biologic products that incorporate such materials would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   idexx’s sales are dependent on distributor purchasing patterns we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors because significant product sales are made to a limited number of customers unanticipated changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results 29    inventories of pharmaceutical products under development may not be usable while our pharmaceutical products are under development we may carry related active ingredients other raw materials and finished goods as assets on our balance sheet when recovery of the asset value from future sales is deemed probable to the extent that these inventories become unusable due to unanticipated delays in obtaining fda approval for these products or to our failure to obtain such approvals we may be required to write down those inventories which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx’s total revenue various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate subsidiaries in 13 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure see note 2m to our consolidated financial statements the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with a duration of less than 12 months gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods our hedging strategy provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year which is complete by the end of the preceding year quarterly we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following twelve months accordingly our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle as of december 31 2003 the company had 30 million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income which is net of 14 million in taxes our currency rate exposure at december 31 2003 consisted of local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency based on our overall currency rate exposure excluding unrealized losses of 44 million at december 31 2003 and 26 million at december 31 2002 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately 22 million for 2004 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar from december 31 2002 would have reduced operating income for 2003 by approximately 24 million a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december 31 2003 would increase operating income by approximately 22 million in 2004 a 10 weakening of the us dollar from december 31 2002 would have increased operating income by approximately 24 million in 2003 as of december 31 2003 a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would reduce operating income by approximately 81 million in 2004  compared to 74 million in 2003 and the effects of a 10 weakening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would increase operating income by approximately 81 million in 2004 compared to 74 million in 2003 30

products and services we operate in two primary business areas products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as our companion animal group “cag” segment and products and services for food and environmental markets which we refer to as our food and environmental group “feg” segment see note 10 to the financial statements for financial information about our business segments including geographic information 

companion animal group immunoassays we provide a broad range of singleuse handheld test kits that allow quick in most cases less than ten minutes accurate and convenient testing for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results in the clinic allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention during the office visit if required 

our principal singleuse tests are sold under the snap name and include a feline combination test the snap combo fiv antibodyfelv antigen test which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline leukemia virus “felv” and feline immunodeficiency virus “fiv” similar to the human aids virus a canine combination test the snap 3dx which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm and a canine heartworm only test sales of heartworm tests are significantly greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease 

in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek name which are used by larger clinics and independent laboratories to test multiple samples petchek tests offer accuracy ease of use and cost advantages to highvolume customers we currently sell petchek tests for felv fiv and canine heartworm disease 

instruments we currently market several instrument systems as well as associated consumable products for use in veterinary clinics these instruments include the following 

  blood chemistry  our vettest blood chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions twentyone separate blood chemistry tests can be performed on the vettest analyzer commonly run tests include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase creatinine bun blood urea nitrogen and total protein 

  hematology  in october 2002 we introduced the lasercyte system a new hematology system that uses laser flow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets we believe that the lasercyte system is the only inclinic hematology system that provides veterinarians with a fivepart white blood cell differential and an absolute reticulocyte count which provides enhanced diagnostic capabilities to veterinarians we also sell the qbc® vetautoread™ hematology analyzer which is based on the becton dickinson qbc® autoread™ hematology system that is sold to physicians for human applications 

  electrolytes our vetlyte system measures three electrolytes — sodium potassium and chloride — to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration test results are available in less than one minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the vetlyte analyzer or downloaded to the vettest analyzer 

  quantitative hormone testing  the vettest snap reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones including thyroxine t4 and cortisol these measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases such as hyper and hypothyroidism cushing’s syndrome and addison’s disease the vettest snap reader is a module that can be integrated with the vettest chemistry analyzer samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our snap device 

veterinary laboratory and consulting services we offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services in the us through facilities located in arizona california colorado illinois maryland massachusetts new jersey oregon and texas through subsidiaries located in the 3 

united kingdom japan and australia we offer commercial veterinary laboratory services to veterinary clinics located in those countries veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals 

additionally we provide specialized veterinary consultation telemedicine and advisory services including cardiology radiology internal medicine dermatology and ultrasound consulting these services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet from the veterinarians’ offices 

approximately 73 74 and 75 of the company’s revenues were derived from sales of veterinary diagnostic products and services within the cag segment in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

information products and services we develop market and sell practice information management software systems that run key functions of veterinary clinics including scheduling billing and patient records management our systems also provide veterinarians with the ability to electronically download laboratory results from our veterinary reference laboratories directly into the patient’s medical records we believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software systems in the us with an installed based of more than 8000 of the approximately 25000 veterinary hospitals in north america we also provide software and hardware support and derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts 

veterinary pharmaceuticals we develop market and sell novel therapeutics for the veterinary market in december 2000 we introduced acarexx 01 ivermectin otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats our first drug approved by the us food and drug administration “fda” in 2002 we commenced active marketing of pzi vet® an insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats under the fda’s regulatory discretion guidelines we currently have a number of other products under development including a nitazoxanidebased product for treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis a neurological disease that is believed to affect approximately 200000 horses in the us diclofenac a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for equine use and tilmicosin a longacting injectable antibiotic for cats we have completed the manufacturing safety and efficacy components of our new animal drug application “nada” for nitazoxanide and we have submitted revised labeling and freedom of information act summary information as requested by the fda we have completed the safety and efficacy components of our nada for diclofenac and have submitted information relating to manufacturing in response to questions from the fda we anticipate submitting information in support of a nada for tilmicosin to the fda in 2003 

food and environmental group we sell products that detect microbial contaminants in water and antibiotic residues in milk and a broad range of diagnostic and health monitoring products for production animals primarily poultry livestock and swine 

approximately 21 20 and 20 of the company’s revenues were derived from sales of food and environmental products and services in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively through a series of transactions completed late in 1999 and early 2000 we disposed of our food microbiology testing products and services business revenues from this disposed product line were approximately 08 million in 2000 

water and dairy testing products our colilert colilert18 and colisure tests based on patented defined substrate technology “dst” simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water our dst products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with us environmental protection agency “epa” standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells 

our enterolert product is also based on dst and detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters with results available in 24 hours our quantitray products when used in conjunction with our colilert colilert18 colisure or enterolert products provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather then a presenceabsence indication the colilert colilert18 colisure and quantitray products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries 

in august 2000 we acquired genera technologies limited a ukbased company that develops and sells products for detection of cryptosporidia in water cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the united kingdom but is not regulated in other countries at this time 

we offer two principal products for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk the snap betalactam test and the parallux system an instrumentbased testing system dairy producers and processors use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk and government and food quality managers use them for ongoing surveillance 

we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap betalactam products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were 163 million in 2002 

production animal services we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine producers significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome “prrs” and pseudorabies virus in pigs newcastle disease in poultry and johne’s disease and brucellosis in cattle 

marketing and distribution we market sell and service our products in more than 50 countries through our marketing sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in australia france germany italy japan mexico the netherlands spain taiwan and the united kingdom 

generally we will select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our veterinary diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and test kits and instrument consumables supplied both via the distribution channel and directly outside the us we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through independent distributors and other resellers and in certain countries through our direct sales force we market our software products and veterinary laboratory services through our direct sales force we market our water dairy livestock and poultry products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force 

in 2002 2001 and 2000 29 28 and 27 respectively of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us risks associated with foreign operations include the need for additional regulatory approvals possible disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets we engage in hedging activities to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information by geographic region note 1j to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our hedging activities and quantitative and qualitative discosure about market risk for a description of foreign currency exchange risk 

in 2002 2001 and 2000 no customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales 

research and development our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry into new business areas our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new animal drugs new diagnostic instrument platforms new immunoassay devices new diagnostic tests and improvements to our diagnostic and testing products our research and development expenses were approximately 293 million 284 million and 283 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

patents and licenses we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties these licenses include an exclusive royalty bearing license of certain patents relating to diagnostic products for fiv which expire in 2009 from the regents of the university of california an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents relating to dst utilized in the colilert colilert18 colisure and enterolert water testing products which expire in 2007 exclusive licenses to certain patents and patent applications relating to detection of lyme disease which expire beginning in 2019 from tulane university and the university of texas and a nonexclusive royaltybearing license from barnesjewish hospital to certain patents relating to canine heartworm tests which expire in 2006 in addition we hold a us patent which expires in 2014 covering certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies which covers our snap combo felvfiv and canine snap 3dx combination tests 

to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — future operating results” 

production and supply vettest analyzers are manufactured for us by tokyo parts industrial company ltd under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew the dry chemistry slides used in the vettest analyzer “vettest slides” are supplied exclusively by orthoclinical diagnostics inc formerly known as johnson and johnson clinical diagnostics inc “ortho” under supply agreements with ortho the “ortho agreements” we are required to purchase all of our requirements for vettest slides from ortho to the extent ortho is able to supply those requirements in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest slides during the term of the ortho agreements the ortho agreements do not prohibit ortho from selling dry chemistry slides for use in veterinary applications and ortho currently sells dry chemistry slides for use in its own analyzer which is primarily designed for human applications but is also used in the veterinary market however ortho may not sell slides that are barcoded for use in the vettest analyzer to any party other than idexx the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2010 although our purchase obligation may be extended at our option through december 31 2011 

the qbc®vetautoread™ system is manufactured for us by becton dickinson under a development and distribution agreement that requires becton dickinson to supply analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010 becton dickinson is the sole source of these analyzers and reagents 

certain other components of our products including the lasers used in our lasercyte system also are available from only one source while we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining any of the components used in our products the loss of any of these sources of supply would have a material adverse effect on the company 

we do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales however backlog at december 31 2002 was larger than in prior periods due to our introduction of the lasercyte system in the fourth quarter of 2002 as of december 31 2002 our backlog of lasercyte orders was approximately 33 million 

competition we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain patent protection and obtain adequate capital resources 

we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures some of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than us 

competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below 

 • veterinary diagnostic products and food and environmental test products  we compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use speed accuracy and other performance characteristics of our products and services the breadth of our product line and services the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels the quality of our technical and customer service and pricing

government regulation many of our products are subject to regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses 

  veterinary diagnostic products  most diagnostic tests for animal health applications are veterinary biological products that are regulated in the us by the center for veterinary biologics within the us department of agriculture’s “usda” animal and plant health inspection service “aphis” the aphis regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation following regulatory approval to market a product aphis requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers in addition aphis requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for governmentmandated disease management programs a number of foreign governments accept aphis approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals however compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in japan germany the netherlands and many other countries we also are required to have a facility license from aphis to manufacture usdalicensed products we have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in westbrook maine 

our instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” under the food drug and cosmetics act the “fdc act” while the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by fda and does not subject us to the fda’s good manufacturing practices regulations “gmps” these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the fdc act 

  veterinary pharmaceuticals  the manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by the center for veterinary medicine “cvm” of the fda a new animal drug may not be commercially marketed in the us unless it has been approved as safe and effective by cvm approval may be requested by filing a new animal drug application “nada” with cvm containing substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug data regarding manufacturing methods and controls are also required to be submitted with the nada manufacturers of animal drugs must 7 

also comply with gmps and good laboratory practices “glps” sales of animal drugs in countries outside the us require compliance with the laws of those countries which may be extensive 

  water testing products  our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval however before a test may be used as part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa the test must first be approved by the epa the epa approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an epa approved protocol evaluation of the data by the epa and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the federal register before final approval our colilert colilert18 colisure quantitray filtamax and simplate for hpc products have been approved by the epa the sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world 

  dairy testing products  the sale of dairy testing products in the us is regulated by the fda in conjunction with the association of official analytical chemists — research institute “aoacri” before a product may be sold extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the fda and the aoacri following approval of a product by fda the product must also be approved by the national conference on interstate milk shipments “ncims” an oversight body that includes state federal and industry representatives our snap betalactam and parallux dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the fda and ncims while some foreign countries accept aoacri approval as part of their regulatory approval process many countries have separate regulatory processes 

any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation these may involve food drug and water quality regulations of the fda the epa and the usda as well as state local and foreign governments see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — future operating results”

 item 5 market for the registrant’s common stock and related stockholder matters our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol idxx the table below shows the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq stock market for the years 2002 and 2001 

tableend  tablestart as of december 31 2002 there were 1183 holders of record of our common stock 

we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we operate primarily through two business segments the companion animal group “cag” and the food and environmental group “feg” cag comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services veterinary pharmaceutical products and veterinary information products and services feg comprises our water testing products dairy testing products and our production animal testing products additionally other is primarily comprised of corporate research and development ceo succession charge and interest income 

business overview the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 

companion animal group our cag segment accounted for approximately 79 of our sales in 2002 and is therefore our most significant business the largest product lines within our cag segment are instruments and instrument consumables laboratory services and rapid assays which accounted for 43 24 and 22 of cag revenues respectively in 2002 to date revenues from sales of pharmaceutical products have not been substantial however we are investing significantly in a 

pipeline of companion animal pharmaceutical products if we are successful in developing obtaining fda approval for and marketing these products we believe that sales of pharmaceutical products will become a more material component of cag sales in the future 

by offering to companion animal veterinarians a broad range and an integrated set of proprietary diagnostic products and services therapeutics and practice management computer systems we believe we have developed a strong customer franchise providing us a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings our complementary products and services give us scale in sales and distribution in this market and permit us to offer programs such as “practice developer” a customer reward that encourages purchases across multiple categories and builds customer loyalty by offering both pointofcare diagnostics for use in the clinic and outside laboratory services we are able to develop integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both pointofcare and laboratory testing in addition by integrating our practice management software systems with our instruments and with our reference laboratories we enhance the veterinary practices of our customers by facilitating the flow of medical information in the clinic 

in the us we sell instrument consumables rapid assays and pharmaceuticals through distributors and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors rather than sales to veterinarians the end users because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product therefore we closely track sales of these products by our distributors to the clinics “cliniclevel sales” which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products in the discussion of results below we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced positively or negatively by changes in distributor inventories 

  instruments and instrument consumables  our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians within integrated set of instruments called idexx vetlab that individually and together provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments during the early stage of an instrument life cycle we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline our longterm success in this area of our business is dependent on our ability both to develop and sell new instruments with enhanced diagnostic capabilities and to maximize customer utilization of those instruments which creates more consumables sales 

we have a large installed base of vettest chemistry analyzers and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales although we continue to place instruments through an active rental program in the us and through sales in europe and asia pacific as a result the success of this product line is dependent on increased customer utilization of those instruments toward that end we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we introduced our new hematology analyzer the lasercyte system which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform the qbc® vetautoread™ system our success in growing hematology revenues over the next several years will depend upon our ability to sell lasercyte instruments although we intend to continue to sell the qbc® vetautoread® system we do not intend to rent lasercyte instruments at earlier stages in the life cycle of this product a substantial portion of lasercyte placements will be made at veterinary clinics that already own our qbc® vetautoread™ instruments as a result net consumables sales are not likely to grow significantly in the near future as we expect the increase in lasercyte consumable sales to be largely offset by declines in sales of qbc® vetautoread™ consumables however we believe that the enhanced diagnostic capabilities of the lasercyte system will lead veterinarians to perform more inclinic hematology testing which will increase consumables sales as our installed base of lasercyte systems increases in addition since we produce the lasercyte consumables the profitability of these consumables is greater than the profitability of the qbc® vetautoread™ consumables which we purchase as finished products 

with all of our instrument lines we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability quality of diagnostic information reliability and customer service our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings our success depends on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy in addition our inclinic instrumentation competes with outside laboratory services for similar diagnostic information and such services are typically offered at a lower cost therefore our success also depends on our ability to market the relative attractiveness of inclinic diagnostic testing versus less convenient and timely but lower priced laboratory testing 

  laboratory services  we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx laboratory services laboratories we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality customer service and technology revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements 

  rapid assays  our rapid assay business comprises singleuse kits for inclinic testing and microwellbased kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions our two principal product lines are canine heartworm products which include the snap 3dx heartworm antigen ehrlichia canis and lyme antibody combination test and the snap fiv antibodyfelv antigen combination test our rapid assay strategy is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs as in our other lines of business we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support these products carry price premiums over competitive products that do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities and which do not include a similar level of support we augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 

food and environmental group   water and dairy testing  our strategy in the water testing business is to develop manufacture market and sell proprietary products with superior performance supported by exceptional customer service our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed from over 20 to approximately 10 in 2002 the decline in growth rate is the result of increased competition and market penetration international sales of water testing products represent 36 of total water product sales and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body as a result we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries primarily in europe we follow a similar strategy in marketing and selling our dairy testing products 

  production animal services  we develop manufacture market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry cattle and swine diseases and conditions and have an active research and development and inlicensing program in this area our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated in response to outbreaks testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods conversely successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products the performance of this business therefore can be subject to fluctuation in 2002 approximately 64 of our sales in this business were international because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations restructuring and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

inventory our inventories include material labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management additional inventory write downs may be required which would have a negative effect on our results of operations certain major components of our inventory are discussed in more detail below 

  nitazoxanide our nitazoxanide product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis “epm” is in registration with the us food and drug administration “fda” we have completed the manufacturing efficacy and safety components of our submission and in february 2003 we submitted revised labeling and freedom of information act summary information as requested by the fda our inventories as of december 31 2002 included 84 million of inventory associated with the nitazoxanide product consisting of 83 million of active ingredient and 01 million of other raw materials the 83 million of active ingredient included in inventory at december 31 2002 will expire in 2005 in 2002 the manufacturer of the active ingredient submitted additional stability data to the fda which supported extending the shelf life of the active ingredient from 48 to 60 months from the date of manufacture upon use of unexpired active ingredient in the manufacture of finished goods the active ingredient shelf life is no longer relevant the shelf life of the finished goods is measured from the date of manufacture regardless of the age of the active ingredient used to manufacture the finished goods based on stability data that we have submitted to the fda we believe that the shelf life of the finished goods will be at least 36 months if and when the product is approved by the fda 

we evaluate our nitazoxanide inventory on a quarterly basis for realizability during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred no further writedowns for this inventory due to expected product expiration our quarterly evaluation is based upon the expiration dates described assumptions regarding the timing of fda approval and our launch of the product and assumptions regarding sales volumes that we expect to achieve following approval and launch of the product we believe that the product will be approved in late 2003 and launched shortly thereafter that the worldwide market for epm treatments is approximately 50 million annually and that our nitazoxanide product will capture approximately 2540 of that market over four years following launch should fda approval be delayed beyond 2003 or should sales volumes be lower than those assumed additional active ingredient would expire and would need to be written off for example if fda approval was obtained in late 2003 but sales volumes over the next four years were fifty percent lower than anticipated and assuming a shelf life of 36 months for finished goods inventory approximately 05 million of additional inventory would expire and require a charge to operations 

if we do not receive fda approval of the nitazoxanide product and if we then elect to terminate our license to use the active ingredient we have the right to require our supplier to repurchase the active ingredient at a price equal to our cost we have no assurances that our supplier has the financial ability to repurchase all of this inventory to the extent we were unable to sell the active ingredient to our supplier we would incur a loss in the amount of any unrecovered costs of the active ingredient this could result in a loss of up to the full value of our net inventory or 84 million as of december 31 2002 

  vettest® slides  our inventories as of december 31 2002 included 302 million of slides used in our vettest chemistry instruments which represents approximately 13 turns based on recent historical usage most of the slides have a shelf life of 24 months at the date of manufacture the average remaining shelf life at december 31 2002 was 169 months in addition we are required to purchase a minimum of 2324 million of slides over the remaining life of our contract with orthoclinical diagnostics inc “ortho” which expires on december 31 2010 although our purchase obligation may be extended at our option through december 31 2011 

we evaluate potential losses over the life of the ortho contract on a quarterly basis our quarterly evaluation is based on an estimate of the value of slides that we are required to purchase under the contract but that will expire before sale the estimated loss is calculated based on the expiration dating described and an evaluation of our minimum contractual purchase obligations relative to assumptions regarding i the percustomer growth in demand for slides over the life of the contract and ii changes over the life of the contract in the size of our installed base of vettest customers resulting from a new vettest instrument placements by us and b loss of customers who switch to other chemistry analyzers supplied by idexx or its competitors we have assumed that the rate of growth of end customer unit sales of vettest slides which grew approximately 7 in 2002 will decline over the life of the ortho contract due to the impact of the factors described in the preceding sentence 

during the quarter ended september 30 2002 we amended the contract with ocd to reduce our minimum purchase commitment for both 2002 and the life of the contract by 30 million slides or approximately 177 million in consideration for our agreement to forego approximately 20 million of certain volume rebates on slides purchased in 2002 as a result of this amendment we do not believe we will incur a loss on the contract and we have reversed the previously established contract loss reserve of 07 million of which 04 million was provided in 2002 however if our assumptions regarding the percustomer demand for slides or the changes in the installed base of vettest instruments are incorrect we could incur loss on this contract for example if we experienced no percustomer growth in demand for slides through the contract term we would incur a loss of approximately 01 million 

  lasercyte hematology instrument  as of december 31 2002 our inventories included 83 million of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument which we began shipping to customers in november 2002 in addition we have placed 09 million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components and we have firm purchase commitments of an additional 21 million we expect to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments however if we alter the design of this product we may be required to write off some or all of the associated inventory 

the nitazoxanide vettest slides and lasercyte products are included in our cag segment 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following 

tableend                                                      tablestart however we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth 

the markets in which idexx competes are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies some of our competitors and potential competitors including large pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than we do 

idexx’s products and services are subject to various government regulations in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture “usda” us food and drug administration “fda” and the us environmental protection agency “epa” most diagnostic tests for animal health applications including our canine feline and poultry and livestock tests must be approved by the usda prior to sale our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they may be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda any failure to comply with regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed among other things to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap betalactam products and to provide related data to the fda if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability the fda could take various actions including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were 163 million in 2002 

commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda to obtain such approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical manufacturing and other data to the fda regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture labeling storage record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products we have several animal pharmaceutical products in registration with the fda including a nitazoxanide product for treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis and a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for the treatment of lameness in horses failure to obtain or delays in obtaining fda approval for these products would have a negative impact on our future growth 

idexx’s future operating results may be negatively impacted by various factors factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services the mix of products and services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could negatively impact our future operating results 

we sell many of our products including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us through distributors as a result changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can result in lower revenue for us because our revenue for each quarter is usually generated from orders received during that quarter our financial performance therefore is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 

while our pharmaceutical products are under development we may carry related active ingredients other raw materials and finished goods as assets on our balance sheet when recovery of the asset value from future sales is deemed probable to the extent that these inventories become unusable due to unanticipated delays in obtaining fda approval for these products or to our failure to obtain such approvals we may be required to write down those inventories which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates” 

we are actively developing new diagnostic platforms including new instrument systems in connection with these programs we are developing production machinery and equipment as of december 31 2002 we had 45 million of these fixed assets on our balance sheet were we to discontinue any such programs we would be required to write off the associated production machinery and equipment such a writeoff could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we believe that more than half of all veterinary diagnostic testing occurs in laboratories although we have a significant laboratory business our inclinic testing business is more material to our results of operations if testing by companion animal veterinarians generally were to shift towards increased laboratory testing and away from inclinic testing this shift could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels therefore a loss in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income 

idexx’s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 

we cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution to such a case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages andor ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore may not be available from other sources these products include our chemistry and hematology analyzers and related consumables active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components of our snap devices and water testing products if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the slides sold for use in our vettest instruments are purchased under an agreement with ocd at fixed prices under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of 2324 million of slides over the remaining life of the contract to the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides we may incur losses in the future under this agreement to the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers our profits on slide sales would decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates” 

international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx’s total revenue various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive market or other factors as a result the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk we operate subsidiaries in 13 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies we attempt to hedge our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 

the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and options with a duration of less than 12 months gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction as of december 31 2002 the company had 26 million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges 

based on our overall currency rate exposure at december 31 2002 including local currency revenues and expenses the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will reduce operating income by approximately 53 million and a 10 weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will reduce operating income by approximately 04 million a 10 strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would reduce operating income by approximately 74 million and the effects of a 10 weakening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place would increase operating income by approximately 74 million

products and services 

  we operate in two primary business areas products and services for the veterinary market which we refer to as our companion animal group cag segment and products and services for food and environmental markets which we refer to as our food and environmental division fed segment see note 11 to the financial statements for financial information about our business segments

 companion animal group

  immunoassays 

  we provide a broad range of singleuse handheld test kits that allow quick in most cases less than ten minutes accurate and convenient testing for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results in the clinic allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention during the office visit if required

  our test kits incorporate immunoassay technology based on antibodyantigen reactions antibodies are proteins produced as a result of an immune response a biological mechanism that enables certain animals to recognize and respond to substances foreign to the body called antigens antibodies are produced by the immune system specifically to bind to these antigens and also to signal other immune system cells to assist in eliminating the antigen antigens include viruses bacteria parasites and hormones in immunoassaybased tests a sample containing an unknown quantity of the analyte is mixed with one or more reagents certain of these reagents contain either antibodies or antigens that bind in a highly specific manner to the analyte certain reagents are labeled with an indicator chemical which identifies the presence or absence of the analyte in some cases results can be read visually in others instruments are used to determine the results

  our principal singleuse tests are sold under the snap name and include tests for feline leukemia virus felv in cats and heartworm disease in dogs and cats we also sell a feline combination test the snap combo felvfiv which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for felv and feline immunodeficiency virus fiv similar to the human aids virus and a canine combination test the snap 3dx which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm sales of heartworm tests are significantly greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease

  in addition to our singleuse tests we sell a line of microwellbased test kits under the petchek name which are used by larger clinics and independent laboratories to test multiple samples petchek tests offer accuracy ease of use and cost advantages to highvolume customers we currently sell petchek tests for felv fiv and canine heartworm disease

  instruments

  we currently market several instrument systems for use in veterinary clinics these instruments include the following

  blood chemistry  our vettest blood chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions twentyone separate blood chemistry tests can be performed on the vettest analyzer commonly run tests include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase creatinine bun blood urea nitrogen and total protein

  hematology  the qbc â vetautoread ä hematology analyzer is used to evaluate certain components of blood including red blood cells white blood cells and platelets these values are useful in determining disease state and health conditions this system is based on the becton dickinson qbc â autoread ä hematology system which is sold to physicians for human applications we also are developing a new hematology system called the lasercyte system which uses laser flow cytometry technology the lasercyte system is designed to provide certain diagnostic capabilities that cannot be obtained from existing inclinic systems which will provide veterinarians with more information necessary to make important clinical decisions regarding an animals health we expect to introduce the lasercyte system in the second half of 2002

  quantitative hormone testing  the vettest snap reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones including thyroxine and cortisol these measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases such as hyper and hypothyroidism cushings syndrome and addisons disease the vettest snap reader is a module that can be integrated with the vettest chemistry analyzer samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our snap device

page 3

  electrolytes  our vetlyte system measures three electrolytes  sodium potassium and chloride  to aid in evaluating acidbase and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration test results are available in less than one minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the vetlyte analyzer or downloaded to the vettest analyzer

  veterinary laboratory and consulting services

  we offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services in the us through facilities located in arizona california colorado illinois massachusetts new jersey oregon and texas through subsidiaries located in the united kingdom japan and australia we offer commercial veterinary laboratory services to veterinary clinics located in those countries veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals

  additionally we provide specialized veterinary consultation telemedicine and advisory services including cardiology radiology internal medicine dermatology and ultrasound consulting these services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet from the veterinarians offices

  approximately 74 75 and 69 of our revenues were derived from sales of veterinary diagnostic products and services within the cag segment in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

  information products and services

  our practice management information software business was formed in 1997 with the acquisitions of advanced veterinary systems and professionals software inc veterinarians use practice information management software to run key functions of their clinics including scheduling billing and patient records management in january 2000 we launched vetconnectcom an internet portal for the veterinary medical market vetconnectcom is a comprehensive suite of information and business services designed to support veterinary medical practice and extend the value of our inclinic products laboratory and consulting services and information offerings we believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software systems in the us with an installed based of more than 8000 of the approximately 25000 veterinary hospitals in north america we also provide software and hardware support and derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts

  veterinary pharmaceuticals

  in october 1998 we acquired blue ridge pharmaceuticals inc blue ridge a privatelyheld company engaged in the development of novel therapeutics for the veterinary market blue ridge was formed in 1996 to develop products for therapeutic applications in companion animals and livestock that might not fit the strategic goals of larger pharmaceutical companies marketing both human and veterinary products in december 2000 we introduced acarexx 01 ivermectin otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats acarexx is our first drug approved by the us food and drug administration fda we currently have a number of other products in the registration process with the fda including a nitazoxanidebased product for treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis a neurological disease that is believed to affect approximately 200000 horses in the us a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory for equine use an insulin product for treatment of diabetic cats and a longacting injectable antibiotic for cats

 food and environmental division

  we sell products that detect microbial contaminants in water and antibiotic residues in milk and a broad range of diagnostic and health monitoring products for production animals primarily poultry livestock and swine

  approximately 20 20 and 22 of our revenues were derived from sales of food and environmental products and services in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively through a series of transactions completed late in 1999 and early 2000 we disposed of our food microbiology testing products and services business revenues from this disposed product line were approximately 08 million and 140 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively

page 4

  water and dairy testing products

  our colilert colilert18 and colisure tests based on patented defined substrate technology dst simultaneously detect total coliforms and e coli in water these organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water our dst products utilize indicatornutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample our water tests are used by government laboratories water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with us environmental protection agency epa standards the tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes for example in beverage and pharmaceutical applications and in evaluating bottled water recreational water waste water and water from private wells

  our enterolert product is also based on dst and detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters with results available in 24 hours our quantitray product when used in conjunction with our colilert colilert18 colisure or enterolert products provides users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather then a presenceabsence indication the colilert colilert18 colisure and quantitray products have been approved by the epa and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries

  in august 2000 we acquired genera technologies limited a ukbased company that develops and sells products for detection of cryptosporidia in water cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the united kingdom but is not regulated in other countries at this time

  we are a worldwide leader in rapid testing of antibiotic residue in milk we offer antibiotic residue tests on our snap platform and we also sell the parallux system an instrumentbased testing system dairy producers and processors use our tests for incoming quality assurance of raw milk and government and food quality managers use them for ongoing surveillance idexx dairy quality tests are designed for convenience in field and laboratory testing applications and are calibrated to detect antibiotic residues at levels specified by regulation

  production animal services

  we sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and monitor health status in production animals our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine producers significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs and pseudorabies virus in pigs newcastle disease in poultry and johnes disease and brucellosis in cattle

marketing and distribution 

  we market sell and service our products in more than 50 countries through our marketing sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers we maintain sales offices outside the us in australia france germany italy japan mexico the netherlands spain taiwan and the united kingdom

  generally we will select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product technical service requirements number and concentration of customers regulatory requirements and other factors we market our veterinary diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the us with most instruments sold directly by idexx sales personnel and test kits and consumables supplied both via the distribution channel and directly outside the us we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through independent distributors and other resellers and in certain countries through our direct sales force we market our software products and veterinary laboratory services through our direct sales force we market our water dairy livestock and poultry products primarily through our direct sales force in the us and canada outside the us and canada we market these products through selected independent distributors and in certain countries through our direct sales force

  in 2001 2000 and 1999 28 27 and 27 respectively of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the us risks associated with foreign operations include the need for additional regulatory approvals possible disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets we engage in limited hedging activities to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings see note 11 to the financial statements for information by geographic region

page 5

  in 2001 and 2000 no customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in 1999 10 of our sales were to the butler company a distributor of veterinary products

research and development 

  our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry into new business areas our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new animal drugs new diagnostic instrument platforms and improvements to our diagnostic and testing products our research and development expenses were approximately 284 283 and 273 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

patents and licenses 

  we actively seek to obtain patent protection in the us and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies we also license patents and technologies from third parties these licenses include an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents relating to diagnostic products for fiv from the regents of the university of california and an exclusive royaltybearing license of certain patents relating to dst utilized in the colilert colisure and enterolert water testing products licensed us patents related to fiv diagnostics expire in 2008 and 2009 licensed us patents relating to dst expire in 2007 in addition we hold a royaltybearing patent license relating to canine heartworm tests from barnesjewish hospital the us patent rights licensed from barnesjewish hospital expire in 2006

  to the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents copyrights or trade secrets of others we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products these licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  future operating results

production and supply

  vettest analyzers are manufactured for us by tokyo parts industrial company ltd under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew the dry chemistry slides used in the vettest analyzer vettest slides are supplied exclusively by orthoclinical diagnostics inc formerly known as johnson and johnson clinical diagnostics inc ortho under supply agreements with ortho the ortho agreements we are required to purchase all of our requirements for slides from ortho to the extent available in addition we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest slides during the term of the ortho agreements the ortho agreements do not prohibit ortho from selling dry chemistry slides for use in veterinary applications and ortho currently sells dry chemistry slides for use in its own analyzer which is primarily designed for human applications but is also used in the veterinary market however ortho may not sell slides that are barcoded for use in the vettest analyzer to any party other than idexx the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2010 and contain provisions for the negotiation of a renewal term of five years

  the qbc â vetautoread ä system is manufactured for us by becton dickinson under a development and distribution agreement that requires becton dickinson to supply analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010 becton dickinson is the sole source of these analyzers and reagents

  certain other components of our products also are available from only one source while we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining any of the components used in our products the loss of any of these sources of supply would have a material adverse effect on the company

  substantially all of our revenue in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter accordingly we maintain no significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date is not indicative of future sales

competition 

  we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing technologies which could affect the marketability of our products and services our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products attract and retain page 6

qualified scientific and other personnel develop and implement production and marketing plans obtain patent protection and obtain adequate capital resources

  we compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical companies our competitors vary in our different markets academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products which could compete with our products on their own or through joint ventures many of our competitors have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than us

  competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below

 government regulation

  many of our products are subject to regulation by us and foreign regulatory agencies the following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of   operations tableend   we operate primarily through two business segments the companion animal group cag and the food and environmental division fed cag comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services veterinary pharmaceuticals business and veterinary information products and services fed comprises our services and products for food and water testing through a series of transactions completed in late 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 we sold substantially all of our businesses related to food microbiology testing fed now comprises our water and dairy testing business and our production animal services business

 critical accounting policies

  the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations restructuring and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

  inventory

  our inventories include material labor and overhead and are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions which may negatively affect our ability to dispose of inventory if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required which would have a negative effect on our results of operations

  our inventories as of december 31 2001 included 86 million of raw materials associated with our nitazoxanide product in registration with the fda of which 84 million will expire and become unusable in 2004 and the remainder has no expiration date we have completed manufacturing and efficacy components of our submission to the fda we have completed additional safety studies requested by the fda with respect to this product and are preparing a submission reporting the results of these studies we believe that the product is approvable by the fda and that this inventory will be saleable upon such approval if this product is not approved by the fda we believe we have the ability to recoup a substantial portion of our costs through alternative future uses of the material or other means we have provided reserves to cover estimated potential losses in this scenario however we cannot provide assurance that the fda will approve this product or if approval is not obtained that our current estimates of recovery of our investment in this inventory will not change

  our inventories include 304 million of slides used in our chemistry instruments which represents approximately 13 turns based on recent historical usage these slides have a shelf life of 24 months at the date of manufacture the average remaining shelf life at december 31 2001 was 165 months in addition we are required to purchase 2890 million of slides over the remaining nine years of our contract with ortho we believe the demand for these slides is at a level sufficient to ensure that we will not incur a loss on the inventory or the contract however a reduction in the demand for slides could cause us to incur a loss related to our slide inventory or purchase commitments at a future date

  our inventories include 60 million of component parts associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument which is in the final stages of development in addition we have placed 09 million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components and we have firm purchase commitments of an additional 62 million we expect to launch this product in the second half of 2002 and to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments however if we are unable to introduce this product or if we alter the final design we may be required to writeoff a certain amount of the associated inventory

  the slides nitazoxanide and lasercyte products are included in our cag segment

page 12

  valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill

  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles longlived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following

  ·   significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results

  ·   significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and

  ·   significant negative industry or economic trends

  when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above we measure any impairment based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to 552 million as of december 31 2001 consisting of 243 million related to veterinary laboratories 150 million related to water test products 146 million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products and 13 million of other

  in 2002 statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result we will cease to amortize approximately 509 million of goodwill we had recorded approximately 51 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately 43 million of amortization during 2002 if the existing standards had been continued in lieu of amortization we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter we expect to complete our initial review during the first half of 2002

  we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review however there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded

  revenue recognition

  we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products except software licenses and hardware systems we recognize revenue from noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and customer acceptance of the software because at this time collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations after installation our distributors do not have the right to return products service revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed maintenance revenue is billed in advance and recognized over the life of the contracts usually one year or less certain instrument systems are sold to a thirdparty finance company that leases these systems to its customers with a rightofreturn privilege we allow the thirdparty finance company to return these instruments to us for a partial refund based on the time from product return to end of lease term therefore we recognize revenue under these contracts over the term of the underlying customer lease contract we lease certain instruments directly to customers and recognize revenues from those leases over the terms of those leases we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or tradein rights

  income taxes

  we account for income taxes under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made likewise should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

page 13

  we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when taxeffective to do so it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings however we believe that us foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any us taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes

  warranty reserves

  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates which are based on historical data and engineering estimates where applicable revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required

  in the second half of 2002 we expect to introduce the lasercyte system we expect that sales of this system will cause warranty expense to increase significantly in 2002 we will charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates our cost of sales of lasercyte systems would increase

 results of operations

  2001 compared to 2000 

  companion animal group 

  revenue for cag increased 123 million or 4 to 3080 million from 2957 million in 2000 the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services canine test kits and acarexx a treatment for ear mites in cats partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and a decrease in sales of slides increased sales of veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to incremental sales resulting from our acquisition of veterinary pathology services pty ltd vps in july 2000 and from increased sales from laboratories in existence during both reporting periods decreased sales of slides resulted primarily from a reduction in distributor inventory levels for this product increased sales of canine test kits were attributable primarily to increased sales of our canine snap 3dx combination test which we introduced in march 2001 sales of acarexx in 2001 were largely incremental to 2000 because we launched this product in december 2000

  as of december 31 2001 our us veterinary diagnostic product distributors were holding 225 million of inventory or approximately eight weeks based on projected future sales these distributors were carrying 221 million or approximately nine weeks of inventory as of december 31 2000

  gross profit as a percent of cags revenue decreased to 45 from 46 in 2000 improved margins on veterinary reference laboratory services and the veterinary practice information management software product line were offset by our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of delays in the launch of our nitazoxanide new animal drug and our lasercyte hematology instrument and by unfavorable exchange rates the increased margins from veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to cost savings from process automation and reduced courier costs the increase in margin from the veterinary practice information management software product line was attributable primarily to infrastructure reductions in our veterinary internet portal and customer service operations

  operating expenses relating to cag increased 11 million or 1 to 1012 million from 1001 million in 2000 the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in veterinary diagnostic sales personnel and related overhead offset by a decrease in expenses relating to our veterinary practice information management software product line

  food and environmental division 

  revenue for fed increased 63 million or 9 to 780 million from 717 million in 2000 the increase was attributable primarily to increased sales of water testing products including incremental revenue from the acquisition of genera technologies limited genera partially offset by decreased sales of dairy testing products the impact of unfavorable exchange rates and decreased sales of food testing products sales of dairy testing products declined due to the elimination of our lactek product in the second quarter of 2001 increased competition and product unavailability due to manufacturing issues sales of food testing products declined due to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business in the first quarter of 2000

page 14

  gross profit as a percent of feds revenue increased to 58 from 57 in 2000 the increase in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to increased sales of higher margin water testing products including those products from genera partially offset by decreased margins on dairy testing products due to our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of lower manufacturing volumes

  operating expenses relating to fed increased 11 million or 5 to 228 million from 217 million in 2000 the increase was attributable primarily to incremental operating expenses and amortization associated with the acquisition of genera and a 15 million onetime gain on the sale of the food product lines that was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in 2000 partially offset by the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food product lines

  2000 compared to 1999 

  companion animal group 

  revenue for cag increased 163 million or 6 to 2957 million from 2794 million in 1999 the increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services vettest slides and feline and canine test kits the increase in veterinary reference laboratory services was attributable primarily to incremental revenues from laboratories acquired in 1999 and 2000 including the laboratory businesses of tufts university school of veterinary medicine acquired in december 1999 and vps acquired in july 2000 the increase in vettest slides was attributable to an increase in instrument placements including those through our rental program and increased customer utilization per instrument these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of veterinary practice information management software systems which were unusually high in 1999 as a result of customer upgrades made in anticipation of the year 2000

  gross profit as a percent of cags revenue decreased to 46 from 47 in 1999 the reduction in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to increased sales of lower gross margin veterinary reference laboratory services higher cost of veterinary instrument service and unabsorbed fixed costs associated with decreased sales of veterinary practice information management software systems partially offset by increased sales of higher margin instrument consumables

  operating expenses relating to cag increased 57 million to 1001 million from 944 million in 1999 the increase was attributable primarily to enhancement of existing diagnostic platforms an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with the pharmaceutical product line and research and development expenses related to vetconnectcom our internet site for animal health professionals additionally we incurred nonrecurring severance and facilities expenses of 21 million associated with consolidation of the internet business and the veterinary practice information management software systems business

  food and environmental division 

  revenue for fed decreased 72 million or 9 to 717 million from 789 million in 1999 the decrease was attributable primarily to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business and to a lesser extent decreased sales of dairy testing products these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of water testing products including incremental sales resulting from the acquisition of genera in august 2000 and increased sales of livestock test kits

  gross profit as a percent of feds revenue increased to 57 from 51 in 1999 the increase was primarily due to the divestiture of the lower gross margin food microbiology testing business and increased sales of higher gross margin water testing products

page 15

  operating expenses relating to fed decreased 76 million to 217 million from 293 million in 1999 the decrease was attributable primarily to the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food microbiology testing products business and to a 15 million gain on the sale of such business that was recorded as a decrease of expenses

  interest income net

  net interest income was 22 million for 2001 compared with 50 million during 2000 the decrease in interest income was mainly due to lower invested cash balances as discussed below as well as lower effective interest rates

  net interest income was 50 million for 2000 compared with 57 million for the prior year the decrease in interest income was principally the result of lower invested cash balances due to the use of cash for our share repurchase program and the purchase of vps and genera partially offset by higher effective interest rates

 provision for income taxes

  our effective tax rate was 36 for 2001 compared with 37 for 2000 and 38 in 1999 the reduction in the effective tax rate was the result of continued realization of tax benefits resulting from business operations in jurisdictions with lower effective income tax rates

 subsequent event

  in january 2002 david e shaw idexxs founder chairman and chief executive officer was succeeded as chairman and chief executive officer by jonathan w ayers under an october 2001 agreement with mr shaw we are required to make certain payments and provide certain benefits to him following a succession to a new chief executive officer as a result we will incur in the first quarter of 2002 a pretax charge of approximately 30 million 20 million of which is noncash

 recent accounting pronouncements

  in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations sfas no 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method 

  in july 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets we will adopt the requirements of sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 sfas no 142 requires companies to test all goodwill for impairment and to cease amortization of this asset the provisions of sfas no 142 apply to all goodwill regardless of when it was acquired we are evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard and have not yet determined the full effect of adoption on our financial statements amortization of goodwill for the year ended december 31 2001 was 51 million see critical accounting policies above

  in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets adoption of the standard is required no later than the first quarter of 2002 we are evaluating the timing and impact of adoption of this standard and have not yet determined the effect of adoption on our financial statements

 liquidity and capital resources 

  at december 31 2001 we had 796 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which 70 million is restricted and working capital of 1642 million as of december 31 2001 we had longterm investments of 210 million

  in connection with the acquisition of genera in august 2000 we issued 83 million in notes payable to a former shareholder of genera 70 million of the notes are due on demand and secured by cash in escrow 13 million of the notes are due in annual installments over four years and have been discounted to 6 the former shareholder has elected to defer the first 05 million payment that was due in august 2001 and therefore the deferred payment now bears interest at 3 and is due on demand

  we have entered into a 200 million uncommitted line of credit with a large multinational bank under the terms of this agreement the bank retains the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings are due on demand any borrowings under this line will bear interest at the banks prime rate there were no loans outstanding under this agreement at december 31 2001

page 16

  we purchased approximately 174 million in fixed assets during the year ended december 31 2001 principally related to the cag segment our total capital budget for 2002 is approximately 170 million under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments slides for our vettest instruments and certain raw materials at december 31 2001 we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately 666 million of products in 2002

  cash provided by operating activities was 464 million during 2001 cash of 203 million was used to fund an increase in inventories attributable principally to the cag segment these increases relate primarily to contractually required purchases of vettest slides inventory associated with the development of our lasercyte hematology instrument and inventory associated with our nitazoxanide new animal drug in registration with the fda

  during 1999 and 2000 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions during 2001 we repurchased 590000 shares of our common stock for 130 million as of december 31 1999 2000 and 2001 approximately 3899000 7024000 and 7614000 cumulative shares respectively had been repurchased under this program see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements

  we are required to make the following payments in the years below in thousands

 

  we believe that current cash shortterm investments longterm investments debt facilities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future

 future operating results 

  the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report

  idexxs future growth will depend on several factors

  the rate of growth of sales of certain of our products has declined over the past several years to increase our growth rate we will need to successfully implement strategies including

   however we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase our growth rate

  the markets in which idexx competes are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change

  we face intense competition within the markets that we sell our products and services we expect that future competition will become even more intense and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies

page 17

  some of our competitors and potential competitors including large pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than us

  idexxs products and services are subject to various domestic and foreign government regulations

  in the us the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the usda fda and epa compliance with regulations of such government agencies can be cumbersome and expensive for example commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals requires submission of substantial clinical manufacturing and other data to the fda regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture labeling storage record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products 

  foreign regulatory bodies often establish product standards different from those in the united states and designing products in compliance with such foreign standards may be difficult or expensive

  delays in obtaining or the failure to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations further any failure to comply with regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products could result in fines and sanctions against us and also could have a negative effect on the sale of our products and services

  idexxs future operating results may be negatively impacted by various factors 

  factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services the mix of products and services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could negatively impact our future operating results 

  since we sell many of our products through distributors changes in distributors purchasing patterns could result in lower revenue for us because our revenue for each quarter is usually generated from orders received during that quarter our financial performance therefore is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable

  our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels therefore a loss in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income

  idexxs success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies 

  we rely on a combination of patent trade secret trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us

  we cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies we also cannot assure that our nondisclosure agreements will provide protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information

  moreover in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe thirdparty patents and we may receive such notices in the future patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict we cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case if we lose we may be stopped from selling certain products andor we may be required to pay damages as a result of the lawsuit

  idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources 

  we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and therefore may not be available from other sources these products include our chemistry and hematology analyzers and related consumables active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components of our snap devices if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

page 18

  international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexxs total revenue

  various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales possible risks include disruptions in transportation of our products the differing product and service needs of foreign customers difficulties in building and managing foreign operations fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies importexport duties and quotas and unexpected regulatory economic or political changes in foreign markets




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

  our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk we operate subsidiaries in 13 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies we attempt to hedge our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure

  the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and options with a duration of less than 12 months gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction

  based on our overall currency rate exposure at december 31 2001 including derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rates will reduce operating income by approximately 05 million and a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rates will increase operating income by approximately 05 million the effects of a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rates if not offset by hedge contracts or related price adjustments would reduce operating income by approximately 57 million and the effects of a 10 weakening of us dollar exchange rates if not offset by hedge contracts or related price adjustments would increase operating income by approximately 57 million

page 2 products and services 

  the company operates in two primary business areas products and services for the veterinary market and products and services for food and environmental markets

 veterinary products and services 

  immunoassays 

  the company provides a broad range of pointofcare diagnostic products for use by veterinarians in testing for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions the company markets a line of singleuse handheld test kits that allow quick in most cases less than ten minutes accurate and convenient testing without the need for laboratory equipment these products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results almost immediately allowing the veterinarians to initiate therapy during the office visit if required

  the companys test kits incorporate immunoassay technology based on antibodyantigen reactions antibodies are proteins produced as a result of an immune response a biological mechanism that enables certain animals to recognize and respond to substances foreign to the body called antigens antibodies are produced by the immune system specifically to bind to these antigens and also signal other immune system cells to assist in eliminating the antigen antigens include viruses bacteria parasites and hormones in immunoassaybased tests a sample containing an unknown quantity of the analyte is mixed with one or more reagents certain of these reagents contain either antibodies or antigens that bind in a highly specific manner to the analyte certain reagents are labeled with an indicator chemical which identifies the presence or absence of the analyte in some cases results can be read visually in others instruments are used to determine the results

  the companys veterinary immunoassays use enzyme labels to indicate the presence or absence of a specific analyte in these enzymelinked immunosorbent assays elisa the test results are measured through a color change which varies in proportion to the amount of the analyte present in the sample

  the company offers snap immunoassays to detect feline leukemia virus felv in cats and heartworm disease in dogs and cats the company also sells a feline combination test the snap combo felvfiv which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for felv and feline immunodeficiency virus fiv similar to the human aids virus and the snap 3dx which tests simultaneously for lyme disease ehrlichia canis and heartworm sales of heartworm tests are significantly greater in the first half of the companys fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease other small animal assays include tests for thyroid hormone levels in dogs and cats and parvovirus which causes a gastrointestinal disease in dogs the companys snap foal igg equine product tests for immune status in newborn foals

  the company also markets a line of elisa microwellbased test kits under the petchek name for testing in larger clinics and independent laboratories serving the veterinary market petchek tests offer accuracy ease of use and cost advantages to highvolume customers the company currently sells petchek tests for feline leukemia virus feline immunodeficiency virus and heartworm disease the company also markets a microwellbased test kit for feline coronavirus under the diasystems trade name

  instruments

  the company currently markets four instrument systems for use in veterinary clinics these instruments are distributed under the trade names of vettest qbc â vetautoread ä  vetlyte and vettest snap reader

  vettest analyzer  the vettest blood chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions twentyone separate blood chemistry tests can be performed on the vettest analyzer the system is capable of running up to 12 tests at a time on a single sample the company also offers prepackaged general health profiles that include 12 frequently used chemistries and preanesthetic panels for young animals consisting of six chemistries each commonly run tests include glucose alkaline phosphatase alt alanine aminotransferase creatinine bun blood urea nitrogen and total protein vettest analyzers are manufactured for the company by tokyo parts industrial co under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew the dry chemistry slides used in the vettest analyzer vettest slides are supplied by orthoclinical diagnostics inc formerly known as johnson and johnson clinical diagnostics inc ortho under supply agreements with ortho the ortho agreements the company is required to purchase all of its requirements for slides from ortho to the extent available in addition the company has committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain vettest slides during the term of the ortho agreements the ortho agreements do not prohibit ortho from selling dry chemistry slides or licensing its slide technology for use in veterinary applications and ortho currently sells dry chemistry slides for use in its own analyzer which is primarily designed for human applications but is also used in the veterinary market however ortho may not sell slides that are barcoded for use in the vettest analyzer to any party other than idexx although the company does not believe sales by ortho in the veterinary market currently have a material adverse effect on the business of the company there can be no assurance that such sales will not have such a material adverse effect in the future the ortho agreements expire on december 31 2010 and contain provisions for the negotiation of a renewal term of five years

page 3   qbc â vetautoread ä hematology system  the qbc â vetautoread ä hematology system is used to evaluate certain components of blood this hematology analyzer is based on quantitative buffy coat technology which uses centrifugal force to separate a blood sample into its key components the blood sample is centrifuged at high speed in a proprietary test device and the different components of the blood separate by density the qbc â vetautoread ä hematology system scans the blood tube quantifies the different components and calculates parameters these values are then compared to normal ranges contained in the software of the analyzer which assists the veterinarian in determining whether disease states are indicated that require further investigation key components evaluated are red blood cells useful in evaluating anemiainternal bleeding white blood cells useful in evaluating infection immunosuppression allergy and platelets useful in evaluating clotting capability the system is based on the becton qbc â autoread ä hematology system sold to physicians for human applications the qbc â vetautoread ä hematology system is manufactured for idexx by becton under a development and distribution agreement which requires becton to supply analyzers to idexx through 2008 and reagents through 2010

  vettest snap reader  the vettest snap reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones including thyroxine and cortisol these measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases such as hyper and hypothyroidism cushings syndrome and addisons disease in addition the analyzer allows the veterinarian to monitor the effect of treatment on these diseases the vettest snap reader is a module which can be integrated with the vettest chemistry analyzer samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using the companys snap device the quantitative measurement is performed automatically with results available for interpretation in less than 15 minutes after sample introduction the results are downloaded and displayed on the vettest analyzer

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of   operations tableend  results of operations 

  the company operates primarily through two business units the companion animal group cag and food and environmental division fed cag comprises the companys veterinary diagnostic products and services its animal health pharmaceuticals business and its veterinary informatics and internet business fed comprises the companys services and products for food and environmental testing through a series of transactions completed in late 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 the company disposed of substantially all of its businesses related to food microbiology testing fed now comprises the companys water and dairy testing business and its production animal services business

2000 compared to 1999 

companion animal group 

  revenue for cag increased 163 million or 6 to 2957 million from 2794 million in 1999 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services veterinary consumables and feline and canine test kits the increase in veterinary reference laboratory services was partially attributable to incremental revenues from laboratories acquired in 1999 and 2000 including the laboratory businesses of tufts university school of veterinary medicine acquired on december 1 1999 and veterinary pathology services pty ltd vps acquired on july 1 2000 the increase in consumables was attributable to an increase in instrument placements including through the companys rental program and in customer utilization per instrument these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of veterinary practice information management systems

  cags gross margin was 46 in 2000 compared to 47 in 1999 the reduction in the gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased sales of lower gross margin veterinary reference laboratory services higher cost of veterinary instrument service and unabsorbed fixed costs associated with decreased sales of veterinary practice information management systems partially offset by increased sales of higher margin veterinary consumables

  operating expenses were 34 of revenue for 2000 and 1999 the 57 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with the pharmaceutical product line research and development expenses related to the companys internet site for animal health professionals and enhancement of existing diagnostic platforms additionally the company incurred nonrecurring severance and facilities expenses associated with consolidation of the internet business and the veterinary practice information management systems business the company anticipates it will incur additional costs in 2001 related to this consolidation

food and environmental division 

  revenue for fed decreased 72 million or 9 to 717 million from 789 million in 1999 the decrease was primarily attributable to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business and to a lesser extent decreased sales of dairy test products these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of water testing products including incremental sales resulting from the acquisition of genera technologies limited genera in august 2000 and increased sales of livestock test kits

  feds gross margin increased to 57 in 2000 from 51 in 1999 the increase was primarily due to the divestiture of the lower gross margin food microbiology testing business and increased sales of higher gross margin water testing products

  operating expenses were 30 and 37 of revenue for 2000 and 1999 respectively the decrease as a percent of revenue and the dollar decrease of 76 million were due primarily to the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food microbiology testing products business and to a 15 million gain on the sale of such business which was recorded as a decrease of expenses

1999 compared to 1998 

companion animal group 

  revenue for cag increased 12 to 2794 million from 2494 million in 1998 the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of consumables used in the companys veterinary instruments veterinary reference laboratory services practice information management hardware software and services and feline test kits sales of practice information management products and services were unusually strong in 1999 due to customer purchases that were made in anticipation of the year 2000 these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of canine test kits and sales of veterinary instruments

page 13   gross profit as a percentage of cag revenue was 47 for 1999 compared to 48 for 1998 higher sales of lower margin veterinary reference laboratory services and practice information management software products and services were partially offset by increased sales of higher margin veterinary consumables

  operating expenses were 34 and 38 of revenue for 1999 and 1998 respectively excluding the writeoff of inprocess research and development associated with the acquisition of blue ridge pharmaceuticals inc blue ridge see note 6 the dollar increase of 04 million was attributable primarily to an increase in research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses attributable to a full year of expense for blue ridge and to development of the internet site for animal health professionals the increase was partially offset by decreased salary and related expenses from sales and marketing workforce reductions decreases in management bonus expense provision for bad debts and currency losses

food and environmental division 

  revenue for fed for 1999 increased 9 to 789 million from 724 million in 1998 the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increased sales of water testing products dairy residue test kits and food laboratory testing services partially offset by decreased sales of dehydrated culture media

  gross profit as a percentage of fed revenue was unchanged at 51 for 1999 and 1998 increased sales of higher margin water dairy residue and livestock test kits were offset by a decline in the average unit prices of poultry kits which was in response to increased competition

  operating expenses were 37 and 43 of revenue for 1999 and 1998 respectively the decrease as a percentage of revenue and the dollar decrease of 17 million were primarily attributable to lower salary and related expenses resulting from sales and marketing workforce reductions partially offset by increased general and administrative costs associated with the divestiture of the food laboratory business and to officer severance expenses

interest income net

  net interest income was 50 million for 2000 compared with 57 million for the prior year the decrease in interest income was principally the result of lower invested cash balances due to the use of cash for the companys share repurchase program and the purchase of vps and genera partially offset by higher effective interest rates

  net interest income was 57 million in 1999 compared to 69 million in 1998 the decrease in net interest income over the prior year was due to interest expense on the notes issued in the acquisition of blue ridge in the last quarter of 1998 decreased cash balances resulting from the acquisition of blue ridge the repurchase of shares of the companys common stock in 1999 and lower domestic interest rates in the first three quarters of 1999

provision for income taxes

  the companys effective tax rate was 37 for 2000 compared with 38 for 1999 the reduction in the effective tax rate is the result of continued realization of tax benefit resulting from business operations in jurisdictions with lower effective income tax rates

  the companys effective tax rate was 38 in 1999 compared to 39 before the writeoff of inprocess research and development in 1998 the decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to the renewal of federal and state credits for research and development activities

 liquidity and capital resources

  at december 31 2000 the company had 752 million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and working capital of 1418 million as of december 31 2000 the company had no longterm investments

page 14   the companys total capital budget for 2001 is approximately 301 million under the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments slides for its vettest instruments and certain raw materials the company has aggregate commitments to purchase approximately 537 million of products in 2001

  cash provided by operating activities was 282 million during 2000 cash of 285 million was used to fund an increase in inventories principally attributable to the cag segment these purchases relate primarily to development of certain pharmaceutical products nearing fda registration and to contractual supply agreements relating to instrument consumables

  during 1999 and 2000 the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of the companys common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions during 2000 the company repurchased 31 million shares of the companys common stock for 703 million as of december 31 1999 and 2000 approximately 39 million and 70 million cumulative shares respectively had been repurchased under this program see note 17

  the company believes that current cash and shortterm investments and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the companys operations for the foreseeable future 

 future operating results

  the future operating results of the company are subject to a number of factors including without limitation the following

  the companys future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop new products and services both for its existing markets and for any new markets the company may enter in the future in recent years sales of the companys chemistry and hematology analyzers have declined as the company has achieved increasing market penetration future growth in sales of the companys analyzers and associated consumables will depend in part on the companys ability to introduce new systems with new features and capabilities the company is currently devoting significant resources to the development of such systems the company also plans to devote significant resources to the growth of many of its other businesses including its animal health pharmaceuticals business there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development and commercialization of products and services for existing and new businesses or that such products and services if commercialized will be successful in the market

  the markets in which the company competes are subject to rapid and substantial technological change the company encounters and expects to continue to encounter intense competition in the sale of its current and future products and services in particular the company has encountered increasing competition in the market for canine heartworm diagnostics and veterinary instruments certain of the companys competitors and potential competitors including large pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater capital manufacturing marketing and research and development resources than the company
