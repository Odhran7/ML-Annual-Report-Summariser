we have established strong and longstanding customer relationships with numerous industry leaders we sell our products directly to enduse customers and to certain oems and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives 

we use a direct sales force to serve enduse customers and oems because these customers typically require higher levels of technical assistance more coordinated shipment scheduling and more complex product service than customers that purchase through distributors we have distribution centers and warehouses that stock parts accessories and certain products to provide adequate and timely availability 

in addition to our direct sales force we are also committed to developing and supporting our global network of over 1000 distributors and representatives who provide a competitive advantage in the markets and industries we serve these distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and parts and provide aftermarket services to endusers while most distributors provide a broad range of products from different suppliers we view our distributors as exclusive at the product category level eg compressor vacuum and blower for example a distributor may exclusively carry our compressor technologies and also source additional components of the broader industrial system in which those products operate from other suppliers our service personnel and product engineers provide the distributors’ service representatives with technical assistance and field training particularly with respect to installation and repair of equipment we also provide our distributors with sales and product literature advertising and sales promotions orderentry and tracking systems and an annual restocking program furthermore we participate in major trade shows and directly market our offerings to generate sales leads and support the distributors’ sales personnel 

our customer base is diverse and we did not have any customers that individually provided more than 1 of 2021 consolidated revenues 

patents tradenames and other intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents tradenames copyrights trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property while in the aggregate our more than 1700 patents and our tradenames are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of our products we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent or tradename and therefore we do not consider any single patent or tradename group of patents or tradenames copyright or trade secret to be material to our business as a whole except for the ingersoll rand and gardner denver tradenames we have registered our tradenames in the countries we deem necessary or in our best interest we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and techniques and we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees as well as our suppliers and other third parties receiving such information 

pursuant to tradename license agreements cooper industries has exclusive rights to use the gardner denver tradename for certain power tools and their components meaning that we are prevented from using this mark in connection with those products 

raw materials and suppliers 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products our most significant commodity exposures are to cast iron aluminum and steel additionally we purchase a large number of motors and therefore are also exposed to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors most of our raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers we have a limited number of longterm contracts with some suppliers of key components but we believe that our sources of raw materials and components are reliable and adequate for our needs in response to recent tightness in the supply chain and in order to improve continuity of supply for select materials and components we have expanded our supplier network in areas we have historically sole sourced we continue to use single sources of supply for certain castings motors and other select engineered components a disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers nevertheless we believe that we have appropriately balanced this risk against the cost of maintaining a greater number of suppliers moreover we have sought and will continue to seek cost reductions in purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases and pursuing alternate sources of supply 

human capital management 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 16000 employees of which approximately 4800 are located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions of those employees located in the united states approximately 250 are represented by labor unions we believe that our current relations with employees are satisfactory 

we evaluate several metrics to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of our human capital management practices including voluntary turnover and engagement in 2021 our voluntary turnover was 116 and 88 for hourly and salaried employees respectively in 2020 our voluntary turnover was 74 and 69 for hourly and salaried employees respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors as well as the other information included in this form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be carefully considered any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the selected risks described below however are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our business 

the covid19 pandemic could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in the future 

covid19 is a continuously evolving situation that has and could continue to impact the global economy in adverse or unpredictable ways our operating results will be subject to fluctuations based on general economic conditions and the extent to which covid19 may ultimately impact our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence such as the geographic spread of the disease the emergence of variants availability of vaccines and treatments and the duration of the outbreak and business closures or business disruptions for our company our suppliers and our customers 

the scale and scope of the covid19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business operating results cash flows andor financial condition described in the other risk factors contained in this report for example we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets the impact of the covid19 pandemic has at times caused a decrease in demand for our products and services a sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact its revenues and profitability in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial condition of our customers has and could in the future make them unable to pay for a product or service when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to 

changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows further we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives the loss of or disruption in our distribution network in connection with the covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business in addition to the foregoing the covid19 pandemic could also exacerbate or trigger other risks discussed herein any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

due to the covid19 pandemic we may experience different and additional risks not discussed herein such as decreased worker productivity as a result of remote working arrangements increased medical emergency or other leave an extended period of remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks including heightened cybersecurity risk remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the covid19 pandemic further we are experiencing increased costs and expenses including as a result of i conducting daily “fitnessforduty” assessments for all employees including temperature and symptoms checks and providing personal protective equipment ii the expansion of benefits to our employees including the provision of additional paid time off for employees who have contracted covid19 or are required to be quarantined and iii implementing increased health and safety protocols at all our facilities including increased cleaningsanitization of workspaces restricting visitor access mandating social distancing guidelines and increasing the availability of sanitization products us and international government responses to the covid19 outbreak have included “shelter in place” “stay at home” and similar types of orders these orders typically exempt certain individuals and businesses needed to maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors or that are deemed “essential” or contain similar exceptions and exemptions although we believe we are currently considered an “essential” business in our operating markets if any of the applicable exceptions or exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future that would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition furthermore to the extent these exceptions or exemptions do not extend to our key suppliers and customers this would also adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers 

our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

in addition we believe that many of our suppliers and customers access global credit markets to provide liquidity and in some cases utilize external financing to purchase products or finance operations if our customers are unable to access credit markets or lack liquidity it may impact customer demand for our products and services 

furthermore our products are sold in many industries some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic contractions cyclical weakness in the industries that we serve could adversely affect demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance 

more than half of our sales and operations are in nonus jurisdictions and we are subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 61 of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states we have manufacturing facilities in germany the united kingdom china italy india and other countries we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available nonus operations and united states export sales could be adversely affected as a result of political or economic instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights credit risks currency fluctuations in particular changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar euro british pound and the chinese renminbi exchange controls changes in and uncertainties with respect to tariffs and importexport trade restrictions including changes in united states trade policy toward other countries such as the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other changes in political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries including the impacts of the uk’s national referendum resulting in the uk’s withdrawal from the european union royalty and tax increases nationalization of private enterprises civil unrest and protests strikes acts of terrorism war or other armed conflict shipping products during times of crisis or war and other factors inherent in foreign operations 

in addition our expansion into new countries may require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel which will divert resources from our existing business operations as we expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks associated with our international operations 

shareholder and customer emphasis on environmental social and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new risks 

our shareholders customers and employees continue to expect a more proactive response to environmental social and governance “esg” matters we may incur increased costs and may be exposed to new risks responding to these higher expectations the company has emphasized its commitment to making a positive impact on our shared planet with the announcement of environmental goals with respect to greenhouse gas emissions renewable energy water usage and landfill waste we may face reputational challenges in the event that we are unable to achieve these goals or our esg standards do not meet those set by certain constituencies these reputational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct our business in many different currencies a significant portion of our revenue approximately 59 for the year ended december 31 2021 is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly currency exchange rates and in particular unfavorable movement in the exchange rates between us dollars and euros british pounds and chinese renminbi affect our operating results the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results are unpredictable because of the number of currencies in which we do business and the potential volatility of exchange rates we are also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations although historically not significant if currency controls were enacted in countries where the company generates significant cash balances these controls may limit our ability to convert currencies into us dollars or other currencies as needed or to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in the countries imposing such controls which could adversely affect our liquidity currency devaluations could also negatively affect our operating margins and cash flows 

we face competition in the markets we serve which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we actively compete with many companies producing similar products depending on the particular product and application we experience competition based on a number of factors including price quality performance and availability we compete against many companies including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess as a result these competitors may be both domestically and internationally better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the global economy as a whole 

in addition our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new competitors entering our markets new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences pricing pressures and new government regulations if we are unable to anticipate our competitors’ development of new products and services identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services or modify existing products and service offerings in response to such competitive factors we could lose customers to competitors if we cannot compete successfully our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials and component parts substantial decreases in their availability or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

our primary raw materials directly and indirectly are cast iron aluminum and steel we also purchase a large number of motors and therefore also have exposure to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors we have longterm contracts with only a few suppliers of key components consequently we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices and availability of such raw materials factors such as supply and demand freight costs and transportation availability inventory levels of brokers and dealers the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price and availability of raw materials in addition we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings motors and other select engineered components that are critical in the manufacturing of our products we have experienced disruptions to our supply deliveries for raw materials and component parts due to reasons related to the pandemic and other recent economic conditions and may experience further supply disruptions any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and therefore our operating results 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results 

we have acquired multiple businesses in recent years and will continue to pursue acquisition of businesses or assets in the future the acquisition and integration of businesses or assets involves a number of risks the core risks are valuation negotiating a fair price for the business integration managing the process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets to extract the value and synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition regulation obtaining necessary regulatory or other government approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions and diligence identifying undisclosed or unknown liabilities or restrictions that will be assumed in the acquisition 

in addition acquisitions outside of the united states often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights in some nonus countries 

• difficulty entering new nonus markets due to among other things consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets and 

• general economic and political conditions 

the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of an acquired company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or prospects 

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies our competitive position may be impaired which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation including those that drive sustainability energy reduction and the reduction andor recycling of water in our customers’ processes can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and technologies or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially and adversely affect our competitive position we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful if we do not compete successfully our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of our customer base 

the loss or reduction of significant contracts with any of our key customers could result in a material decrease of our future profitability and cash flows in addition the consolidation or vertical integration of key customers may result in the loss of certain customer contracts or impact demand or competition for our products any changes in such customers’ purchasing practices or decline in such customers’ financial condition may have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition some of our customers are significantly larger than we are have greater financial and other resources and also have the ability to purchase products from our competitors as a result of their size and position in the marketplace some of our customers have significant purchasing leverage and could cause us to materially reduce the price of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability we are unable to predict what effect consolidation in our customers’ industries could have on prices capital spending by customers selling strategies competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with customers 

credit and counterparty risks could harm our business 

the financial condition of our customers could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables in addition financial difficulties faced by our customers as a result of an adverse economic event or other market factors may lead to cancellation or delay of orders our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a product or solution when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows 

we may not realize all of the expected benefits of the acquisition of and merger with ingersoll rand industrial 

the anticipated benefits of the ingersoll rand industrial acquisition may not be realized fully or at all and may take longer to realize than expected the integration process is complex costly and timeconsuming which could adversely affect our businesses financial results and financial condition the merger may not result in the realization of the full benefits of anticipated cost synergies innovation operational efficiencies and incremental revenue growth opportunities that we expect to realize or these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time moreover the combined company may be unable to implement its business strategy or retain and hire key personnel see also “risks related to our business—acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results” 

dispositions create certain risks and may affect our operating results 

dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses increased expense associated with the dispositions potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share 

if dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negative effect on our cash flows andor our ability to execute our strategy in addition we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions 

on february 14 2021 the company entered into an agreement to sell its majority interest in high pressure solutions to private equity firm american industrial partners in exchange for its majority interest of 55 the company received net cash proceeds of 2783 million and retained a 45 common equity interest in the newlyformed entity comprising the hps business this sale was substantially completed on april 1 2021 

on april 9 2021 the company entered into an agreement to sell specialty vehicle technologies to private equity firm platinum equity advisors llc “platinum equity” for 168 billion in cash the sale was substantially completed on june 1 2021 

see note 3 “discontinued operations” of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these transactions 

information systems failure or disruption due to cyber terrorism or other actions may adversely impact our business and result in financial loss to the company or liability to our customers 

our business is highly dependent on financial accounting and other dataprocessing systems and other communications and information systems including our enterprise resource planning tools we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems if any of these systems fail whether caused by fire other natural disaster power or telecommunications failure acts of cyber terrorism or war or otherwise or they do not function correctly we could suffer financial loss business disruption liability to our customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions our ability to grow could be limited although we have backup systems procedures and capabilities in place they may also fail or be inadequate further to the extent that we may have customer information in our databases any unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information could result in claims under data protection laws and regulations if any of these risks materialize our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected 

third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 

our success depends in part on the creation maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents tradenames trade secrets copyrights confidentiality provisions contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights our nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of breach of such agreements or unauthorized disclosure of such information and if a competitor lawfully obtains or independently develops our trade secrets we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using such technology or information to compete with us either of which could harm our competitive position our applications for patent and tradename protection may not be granted or the claims or scope of such issued patents or registered tradenames may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products in addition effective patent copyright tradename and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our tradenames and patents in some foreign countries we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights and we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing infringement or misappropriation if we fail to 

successfully enforce these intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our operating results 

although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of the intellectual property of others may not be successful and from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents tradenames or other proprietary rights of such third party responding to and defending such claims regardless of their merit can be costly and timeconsuming can divert management’s attention and other resources and we may not prevail depending on the resolution of such claims we may be barred from using a specific technology or other rights may be required to redesign or reengineer a product which may require significant resources may be required to enter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may become liable for significant damages 

if any of the foregoing occurs our ability to compete could be affected or our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the loss of or disruption in our distribution network could have a negative impact on our abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business 

we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives we rely in large part on the orderly operation of this distribution network which depends on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management we conduct all of our shipping through independent third parties although we believe that our receiving shipping and distribution process is efficient and wellpositioned to support our operations and strategic plans we cannot provide assurance that we have anticipated all issues or that events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements acquisition of distributors by a competitor consolidation within our distributor network or shipping problems will not disrupt our distribution network if complications arise within a segment of our distribution network the remaining network may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands any of these disruptions or complications could negatively impact our revenues and costs 

a natural disaster catastrophe pandemic or other event could adversely affect our operations 

some of our operations involve risks of among other things property damage which could curtail our operations for example if one or more of our manufacturing facilities are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster accident catastrophe or event our operations could be significantly interrupted impacting our ability to produce products and sell products to customers these interruptions might involve significant damage to among other things property and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to many months for a major interruption in addition disruptions in our supply chain due to natural disasters catastrophes pandemic or other events could reduce our ability to produce products and satisfy customer demand similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that provide supplies or other raw materials to our plants interruptions to our operations and supply chain could also result from pandemic which could adversely impact our workforce or that of our suppliers causing disruption to the manufacturing process or our supply chain and last a week or months depending on the severity of the disruption 

our ongoing and expected restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect to result from these actions our operating results could be negatively affected by our inability to effectively implement such restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives 

we continually seek ways to simplify or improve processes eliminate excess capacity and reduce costs in all areas of our operations which from time to time includes restructuring activities we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our global manufacturing sales and distribution footprint which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations we incurred restructuring charges of 134 million and 830 million in the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively costs of future initiatives may be material and the savings associated with them are subject to a variety of risks including our inability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel rationalize manufacturing capacity synchronize information technology systems consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities as a result the contemplated costs to effect these initiatives may materially exceed estimates the initiatives we are contemplating may require consultation with various employees labor representatives or regulators and such consultations may influence the timing costs and extent of expected savings and may result in the loss of skilled employees in connection with the initiatives 

although we have considered the impact of local regulations negotiations with employee representatives and the related costs associated with our restructuring activities factors beyond the control of management may affect the timing of these projects and therefore affect when savings will be achieved under the plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all or that we will realize the projected benefits of these and other restructuring and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement our cost savings initiatives our business may be adversely affected moreover our continued implementation of cost savings initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition as we consolidate facilities and relocate manufacturing processes to lowercost regions our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customer demand and maintain a high level of quality throughout the transition failure to adequately meet customer demand or maintain a high level or quality could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel and our ability to attract and retain top talent throughout the company 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide us with uninterrupted leadership and direction the failure to retain our executive officers and other key personnel or a failure to provide adequate succession plans could have an adverse impact our future success also depends on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel at all levels of the organization the availability of highly qualified talent is limited in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the competition for talent is robust a failure to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel throughout the organization could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages could negatively impact our results particularly with respect to fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products 

a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract or require that we at our expense correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects because substantially all of our custom engineered product contracts are at a fixed price we face the risk that cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages may exceed erode or eliminate our expected profit margin or cause us to record a loss on our projects 

the risk of noncompliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives 

our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws regulations and policies which could result in conflicting legal requirements these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include import and export control environmental health and safety regulations data privacy requirements international labor laws and work councils and anticorruption and bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the un convention against bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials 

we are subject to the risk that we our employees our affiliated entities contractors agents or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws for which we might be held responsible particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions an actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil or criminal penalties debarment from government contracts curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions competitive or reputational harm litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results 

in 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 and 2018 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property the tax act also established new tax laws that significantly affected recent and future tax years 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we 

undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 16 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to our accounting for income tax matters 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows further the specific future impacts of the tax act on holders of our common shares are uncertain and could in certain instances be adverse we urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock 

our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages union and work council campaigns or other labor difficulties 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 16000 employees of which approximately 4800 were located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 250 are represented by labor unions although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages work stoppages have occurred and may in the future occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in addition negotiations with our union employees may 1 result in significant increases in our cost of labor 2 divert management’s attention away from operating our business or 3 break down and result in the disruption of our operations the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs andor decreased operating results 

we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants we believe that given our financial reserves and anticipated insurance recoveries the pending and potential future lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity however future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome in addition even if any damages payable by us in any individual lawsuit are not material the aggregate damages and related defense costs could be material and could materially adversely affect our financial condition if we were to receive an adverse judgment in a number of these lawsuits accordingly the resolution of pending or future lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity see note 21 “contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims which could harm our business 

customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property equipment or the environment in addition our products are integral to the production process for some endusers and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations although we maintain quality controls and procedures we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are currently adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size and we limit our liability by contract wherever possible however we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used 

a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 

we have substantial goodwill as a result of past acquisitions as of december 31 2021 the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets net represented 99 billion or 65 of our total assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 

impairments if any could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2020 we recognized an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 199 million within the industrial technologies and services segment see note 9 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety under such laws and regulations we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or put into effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 

we use and generate hazardous substances and waste in our manufacturing operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages a liability on our balance sheet reflects costs that are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide as of december 31 2021 our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 1947 million “unfunded status” estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates rates of compensation increases expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates if our assumptions prove incorrect our funding obligations may increase which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities a deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences and adversely affect our financial condition 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2021 we had total indebtedness of 34406 million and we had availability under the revolving credit facility of 10934 million our high level of debt could have important consequences including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors increasing our cost of borrowing and hampering our ability to execute on our growth strategy for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 11 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control as well as and including those factors discussed under “risks related to our business” above we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to implement any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and our secured lenders including the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

despite our level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt including offbalance sheet financing contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future including offbalance sheet financings contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities although the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 16000 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we also can incur additional secured indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 11 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness pay dividends make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital stock prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt make loans investments and other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of assets incur liens enter into transactions with affiliates enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets make needed capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions investments or enter into joint ventures plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies and engage in business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest 

a breach of the covenants under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal andor related interest payments and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings andor interest we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into payfixed interest rate swap instruments from time to time to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments will result in economic losses should interest rates not rise above the payfixed interest rate in the derivative contracts we will be exposed to creditrelated losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps see note 19 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

if the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our revolving credit facility fail to extend credit under our revolving credit facility our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we have access to capital through our revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our revolving credit facility is responsible on a several but not joint basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our facility if any participant or group of participants with a significant portion of the commitments in our revolving credit facility fails to satisfy its or their respective obligations to extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or participants on a timely basis if at all our liquidity may be adversely affected 

the company may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from currently used financial reference rates 

libor and certain other floating rate benchmark indices to which our floating rate debt is tiedcollectively “ibors” are the subject of recent national international and regulatory guidance and proposals for reform on november 30 2020 the financial conduct authority of the uk or the fca announced that subject to confirmation following its consultation with the administrator of libor it would cease publication of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after june 30 2023 additionally the us federal reserve board has advised banks to stop entering into new usd libor based contracts the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has identified the secured overnight financing rate or sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities as its preferred alternative rate for libor at this time it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the ibor benchmarks is anticipated in coming years 

as of december 31 2021 we had 34 billion of floated rate debt with maximum maturities extending past 2021 tied to ibor benchmarks there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of any ibor benchmark or of any particular replacement rate in addition any ibor benchmark may perform differently during any phaseout period than in the past as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined and any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs which could impact our results of operations and cash flows in addition we may need to renegotiate certain of our debt agreements with lenders which could require us to incur significant expense and may subject us to disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to the relevant ibor benchmark of the replacement reference rates we are assessing the impact of a potential transition from ibor however we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the transition at this time

components of our revenue and expenses 

revenues 

we generate revenue from sales of original equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services we sell our products and deliver services both directly to endusers and through independent distribution channels depending on the product line and geography revenue derived from short duration contracts is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or as services are performed certain contracts involve significant design engineering unique to customer specifications and depending upon the contractual terms revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when equipment is delivered to the customer

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses net restructuring charges certain shareholder litigation settlement recoveries acquisition and other transaction related expenses and noncash charges losses and gains on asset disposals and other miscellaneous operating expenses 

provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision or benefit for income taxes includes us federal state and local income taxes and all nonus income taxes we are subject to income tax in approximately 47 jurisdictions outside of the united states because we conduct operations on a global basis our effective tax rate depends and will continue to depend on the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions the availability of tax credits and nondeductible items 

items affecting our reported results 

general economic conditions and capital spending in the industries we serve 

our financial results closely follow changes in the industries and endmarkets we serve demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures depends in turn on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost in particular demand for our industrial technologies and services products generally correlates with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production capacity utilization rates above 80 have historically indicated a strong demand environment for industrial equipment in the midstream and downstream portions of our industrial technologies and services segment overall economic growth and industrial production as well as secular trends impact demand for our products in our precision and science technologies segment we expect demand for our products to be driven by favorable trends including the growth in healthcare spend and expansion of healthcare systems due to an aging population requiring medical care and increased investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures in emerging economies over longer time periods we believe that demand for all of our products also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gdp around the world as augmented by secular trends in each segment our ability to grow and our financial performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations including efficiently utilizing our global sales manufacturing and distribution capabilities and engineering innovative new product applications for endusers in a variety of geographic markets 

foreign currency fluctuations 

a significant portion of our revenues approximately 59 for the year ended december 31 2021 was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the united states a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion 

factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations 

as a result of a number of factors our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below 

acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

on february 29 2020 we completed the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial ingersoll rand industrial is included in our results of operations beginning on the acquisition date close of business february 29 2020 comparability between the years 

ended december 31 2021 and 2020 will be affected by the inclusion of twelve months of activity from ingersoll rand industrial in 2021 compared to only ten months of activity in 2020 

see note 4 “business combinations” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

other acquisitions 

part of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary flow control and compression equipment businesses which provide access to new technologies or geographies or improve our aftermarket offerings in addition to the ingersoll rand industrial transaction discussed above we have acquired several other businesses during the three year period ended december 31 2021 while these acquisitions are not individually significant or significant in the aggregate they may be relevant when comparing our results from period to period 

see note 4 “business combinations” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of these acquisitions 

impact of coronavirus covid19 

we continue to assess and actively manage the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our global operations and also the operations of our suppliers and customers demand for our products was negatively impacted throughout the majority of 2020 as a result of the pandemic demand began to improve in the fourth quarter of 2020 and accelerated in the first half of 2021 as markets strengthened and gained greater visibility to vaccine rollout strategies in various regions order rates in the first half of 2021 were particularly strong and we believe represent some deferred demand from 2020 in order to position ourselves to fulfill demand we continue to monitor the supply chain closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure continuity of supply we are adhering to all state and country mandates and guidelines wherever we operate currently all our major manufacturing locations are operational we have taken certain actions to reduce costs and preserve cash given the uncertain environment the degree to which the pandemic will continue to impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers remains uncertain see “the covid19 pandemic could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in the future” in part ii item 1a “risk factors” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

restructuring and other business transformation initiatives 

we continue to implement business transformation initiatives a key element of those business transformation initiatives was restructuring programs within our industrial technologies and services and precision and science technologies segments as well as at the corporate level restructuring charges program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly 

subsequent to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial we announced a restructuring program “2020 plan” to drive efficiencies and synergies reduce the number of facilities and optimize operating margin within the merged company for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 134 million and 830 million respectively were charged to expense related to this restructuring program through december 31 2021 we recognized expense related to the 2020 plan of 787 million 69 million and 108 million for industrial technologies and services precision and science technologies and corporate respectively 

stockbased compensation expense 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we incurred stockbased compensation expense of approximately 872 million and 475 million respectively the increase from 2020 was primarily due to the 150 million equity grant to nearly 16000 employees worldwide announced in the third quarter of 2020 see note 18 “ stockbased compensation ” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion around our stockbased compensation expense 

how we assess the performance of our business 

we manage operations through the two business segments described above in addition to our consolidated gaap financial measures we review various nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow 

we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily 

correspond to changes in the operations of our business adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain noncash nonrecurring and other adjustment items we believe that the adjustments applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material noncash items and about nonrecurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future adjusted net income is defined as net income loss including interest depreciation and amortization of nonacquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate adjusted ebitda and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions 

we use free cash flow to review the liquidity of our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt free cash flow is not a measure of our liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities 

management and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation such measures are provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures under gaap in addition we believe that adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers many of which also present adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity 

adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under gaap 

included in our discussion of our consolidated and segment results below are changes in revenues and adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda as total revenues and adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the constant currency revenue and adjusted ebitda growth on a yearoveryear basis constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period revenues and adjusted ebitda using corresponding prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap 

for further information regarding these measures see “nongaap financial measures” below

1 see “nongaap financial measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

revenues 

revenues for 2021 were 51524 million an increase of 11792 million or 297 compared to 39732 million in 2020 the increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial of 5375 million and organic volume growth in our industrial technologies and services segment of 3303 million the increase due to acquisitions is impacted by the inclusion of twelve months of activity from ingersoll rand industrial in 2021 compared to only ten months of activity in 2020 organic volume growth in 2021 partially reflects the adverse impact of covid19 in 2020 the percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 362 in 2021 compared to 355 in 2020 

gross profit 

gross profit in 2021 was 19885 million an increase of 5836 million or 415 compared to 14049 million in 2020 and as a percentage of revenues was 386 in 2021 and 354 in 2020 the increase in gross profit is primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial higher volumes in our industrial technologies and services segment and the runoff of the fair valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial impacting cost of sales in 2020 that did not recur in 2021 the increase due to acquisitions is impacted by the inclusion of twelve months of activity from ingersoll rand industrial in 2021 compared to only ten months of activity in 2020 the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the runoff of the fair valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial impacting cost of sales in 2020 that did not recur in 2021 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses were 10280 million in 2021 an increase of 2387 million or 302 compared to 7893 million in 2020 selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 200 in 2021 from 199 in 2020 this increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial and increased incentive compensation 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets was 3329 million in 2021 a decrease of 22 million compared to 3351 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets primarily backlog related to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial becoming fully amortized partially offset by the inclusion of twelve months of activity from ingersoll rand industrial in 2021 compared to only ten months of activity in 2020 as well as intangible assets acquired in 2021 

impairment of intangible assets 

impairment of intangible assets was 199 million in 2020 due to the impairment of two tradenames in the industrial technologies and services segment there were no impairments recognized during the year ended december 31 2021 see note 9 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 619 million in 2021 a decrease of 1391 million compared to 2010 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to lower restructuring charges of 696 million lower acquisition related expenses of 380 million and higher foreign currency transaction gains net of 306 million 

interest expense 

interest expense was 877 million in 2021 a decrease of 234 million compared to 1111 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate as well as the payoff of the dollar term loan series a in the third quarter of 2021 the weightedaverage interest rate was approximately 20 in 2021 and 35 in 2020 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

loss on extinguishment of debt was 90 million in 2021 which was related to the payoff of the dollar term loan series a loss on extinguishment of debt was 20 million in 2020 which was related to the refinancing of the original dollar term loan and the original euro term loan see note 11 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

other income net 

other income net was 440 million in 2021 an increase of 359 million compared to 81 million in 2020 the increase in other income net was primarily due to recognition of a 300 million gain upon settling postacquisition contingencies related to the ingersoll rand industrial transaction outside of the measurement period in the second quarter of 2021 

provision for income taxes 

the benefit for income taxes was 218 million resulting in a 42 effective tax rate in 2021 compared to a provision for income taxes of 114 million resulting in a 251 effective tax provision rate in 2020 the decrease in the tax provision and the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the pretax book income in jurisdictions with lower effective 

tax rates combined with lower earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates the rate increase was mitigated by the release of unrecognized tax reserves as a result of the lapse of the limitation on statutes a benefit associated with the final settlement on the merger transaction a onetime restructuring benefit and foreign tax credit utilization 

net income loss 

net income was 5650 million in 2021 compared to net loss of 324 million in 2020 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher gross profit on increased revenues and lower other operating expenses net partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda increased 3138 million to 11919 million in 2021 compared to 8781 million in 2020 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues increased 100 basis points to 231 in 2021 from 221 in 2020 the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher organic sales volume of 1576 million improved pricing of 1390 million and acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial of 1275 million partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses the increase in adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to organic growth in our industrial technologies and services segment 

adjusted net income 

adjusted net income increased 3614 million to 8814 million in 2021 compared to 5200 million in 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher adjusted ebitda lower income tax provision as adjusted and lower interest expense

revenues 

revenues for 2021 were 4309 million a decrease of 3105 million or 419 compared to 7414 million in 2020 the decrease in revenues from discontinued operations was primarily due to the sale of svt being substantially completed on june 1 2021 refer to note 3 “discontinued operations” to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion

gain on sale 

gain on sale for the year ended december 31 2021 of 2983 million was due to the purchase price exceeding the carrying value of the svt business 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense net was 181 million for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 164 million compared to 17 million in 2020 the increase was primarily due to higher separation related expenses and noncash charges of 172 million partially offset by lower restructuring charges of 08 million

f includes i effects of amortization of prior service costs and amortization of losses in pension and other postemployment  “ opeb ”  expense ii certain legal and compliance costs and iii other miscellaneous adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 

our investment resources include cash on hand cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have the ability to seek additional secured and unsecured borrowings subject to credit agreement restrictions 

for a description of our material indebtedness see note 11 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings 66 million of outstanding letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility and unused availability of 10934 million 

as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing 

liquidity 

a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements and from the ongoing cost of operations working capital and capital expenditures 



we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 16000 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we can incur additional secured indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements see note 11 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

our principal sources of liquidity have been existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities our principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital meet debt service requirements fund capital expenditures and finance strategic plans including possible acquisitions we may also seek to finance capital expenditures under capital leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms we continue to consider acquisition opportunities but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings we may from time to time seek to repay loans that we have borrowed including the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities based on our current level of operations and available cash we believe our cash flow from operations together with availability under the revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future our ability to do so depends on among other factors prevailing economic conditions many of which are beyond our control in addition upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in control we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness including the senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices including through a rule 10b51 plan in privately negotiated transactions a combination thereof or through other transactions the actual timing number manner and value of any shares repurchased will depend on several factors including the market price of our stock general market and economic conditions our liquidity requirements applicable legal requirements and other business considerations 

a substantial portion of our cash is in jurisdictions outside the united states we do not assert asc 74030 formerly apb 23 indefinite reinvestment of our historical nonus earnings or future nonus earnings the company records a deferred foreign tax liability to cover all estimated withholding state income tax and foreign income tax associated with repatriating all nonus earnings back to the united states our deferred income tax liability as of december 31 2021 is 496 million which consists mainly of withholding taxes 

working capital 



net working capital increased 2837 million to 26472 million as of december 31 2021 from 23635 million as of december 31 2020 operating working capital increased 463 million to 9754 million as of december 31 2021 from 9291 million as of december 31 2020 operating working capital as of december 31 2021 was 189 of 2021 revenues as compared to 234 as of december 31 2020 as a percentage of 2020 revenues the increase in operating working capital was primarily due to higher inventories and higher accounts receivable partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher contract liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and to acquisitions completed in 2021 the increase in inventory was primarily attributable to additions to inventory in anticipation of increased demand for certain products and to acquisitions completed in 2021 the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of vendor cash disbursements the increase in contract liabilities was due to the timing of customer milestone payments for inprocess engineered to order contracts 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 



1 see “nongaap financial measures” for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 257 million to 6278 million in 2021 from 6535 million in 2020 primarily due to changes in accrued liabilities and cash used in operating working capital partially offset by higher income from continuing operations 

operating working capital used cash of 30 million in 2021 compared to generating cash of 1713 million in 2020 changes in account receivables used cash of 625 million in 2021 compared to generating cash of 524 million in 2020 changes in contract assets used cash of 04 million in 2021 compared to using cash of 117 million in 2020 changes in inventory used cash of 1344 million in 2021 compared to generating cash of 1590 million in 2020 changes in accounts payable generated cash of 1182 million in 2021 compared to using cash of 434 million in 2020 changes in contract liabilities generated cash of 761 million in 2021 compared to generating cash of 150 million in 2020 

investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures of 641 million 12 of consolidated revenues and 420 million 11 of consolidated revenues in 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect capital expenditures will be approximately 

2 of consolidated revenues in 2022 cash acquired paid in business combinations was 9748 million in 2021 and 90 million in 2020 net proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were 95 million and 17 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities of 11570 million in 2021 is primarily due to purchases of treasury stock of 7368 million repayments of longterm debt of 4357 million and cash dividends on common stock of 82 million offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 237 million 

cash provided by financing activities of 3287 million in 2020 is primarily due to proceeds from longterm debt of 19801 million offset by repayments of longterm debt of 16191 million and payments of debt issuance costs of 478 million also included are proceeds from stock option exercises of 227 million and a net usage of cash of 30 million related to the purchase and sale of noncontrolling interests of our india subsidiary see note 13 “stockholders’ equity and noncontrolling interests” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

discontinued operations 

cash provided by discontinued operations increased 16772 million to 19314 million in 2021 from 2542 million in 2020 primarily due to proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 

free cash flow 

free cash flow decreased 478 million to 5637 million in 2021 from 6115 million in 2020 primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations consist primarily of agreements to purchase inventory or services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements as of december 31 2021 the company had purchase of obligations of 4412 million with 3715 million payable in the next 12 months the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated as of december 31 2021 for this reason these amounts will not provide a complete and reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows 

contingencies 

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including a total litigation reserve of 1369 million as of december 31 2021 with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation other than our asbestosrelated litigation reserves we only have de minimis accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to other legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth in “item 3 legal proceedings” 

critical accounting policies 

accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties certain of these policies include estimates and assumptions these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increase in tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

business combinations 

we apply the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of a business combination and record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the 

cost of the acquired business and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate of assumptions and about future events and uncertainties including significant judgments related to future cash flows discount rates competitive trends margin and revenue growth assumptions including royalty rates and customer attrition rates market comparables and others inputs used are generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives the fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but which are inherently uncertain see note 3 “business combinations” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information regarding the fair value determination of each of the classes of identifiable intangible assets determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives while certain other identifiable intangible assets have determinable lives the useful lives of identifiable intangibles with determinable useful lives are based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the competitive environment product cycles order life cycles historical customer attrition rates market share operating plans and the macroeconomic environment the costs of determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life 

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of october 1 of that year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable upon adoption of asu 201904 the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value provided the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if applicable we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss we determined fair values for all of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiples approaches which are weighted 75 and 25 respectively 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2021 reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 to 95 additionally we assumed 30 terminal growth rates for all reporting units except a single reporting unit in which we determined it most appropriate to assume an 20 terminal growth rate due to it being closely aligned to the gdp percentage growth rate 

under the market multiples approach fair value is determined based on multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded guideline companies to develop a business enterprise value “bev” for our reporting units the application of the market multiples method entails the development of book value multiples based on the market value of the guideline companies the multiples are developed by first calculating the market value of equity of the guideline companies and then adjusting these multiples for cash and debt to arrive at a bev multiple identifying appropriate guideline companies and computing appropriate market multiples is subjective we considered various public companies that had reasonably similar qualitative factors as our reporting units while also considering quantitative factors such as revenue growth profitability and total assets 

with the exception of one reporting unit formed through a recent acquisition the estimated fair values of our reporting units were well in excess of their carrying values the carrying value of the recentlyformed reporting unit was approximately equal to its fair value due to the close proximity of the acquisition date to the impairment testing date the estimated fair values of all other reporting units were at least 47 higher than their carrying values and therefore no impairments were identified 

we test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation referred to as the relief from royalty method we estimated forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 90 to 100 terminal growth rates of 20  to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 05 to 40 as a result of this test there were no impairments recognized during the year ended december 31 2021 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 

also see note 9 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 created a new requirement that certain income ie global intangible low taxed income “gilti” earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfc” must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income 

under us gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company has determined that it will follow the period cost method option 1 above going forward the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2021 reflects this decision all of the additional calculations and rule changes found in the tax act have been considered in the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recorded a tax expense of 117 million in 2021 for the gilti provisions of the tax act 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to tax attribute carryforwards net of valuation allowances were 380 million and 407 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively with the decrease related to utilizing the attributes 

loss contingencies 

loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to asbestos and silica related litigation environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency in particular as it relates to estimating asbestos and silica contingencies there are a number of key variables and assumptions including the number and type of new claims to be filed each year the resolution or outcome of these claims the average cost of resolution of each new claim the amount of insurance available allocation methodologies the contractual terms with each insurer with whom we have reached settlements the resolution of coverage issues with other excess insurance carriers with whom we have not yet achieved settlements and the solvency risk with respect to our insurance carriers moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on 

negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variablerate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable debt and from time to time use payfixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative fixed and variable portions 

as of december 31 2021 we had variable rate debt outstanding of 34494 million at a current weighted average interest rate of approximately 19 substantially all of which was incurred under our senior secured credit facility under which an aggregate of 27781 million was outstanding under the 19000 million dollar term loan b and 9276 million dollar term loan as well as €5906 million outstanding under the €6012 million euro term loan facility 

the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility bear interest primarily based on libor and euribor respectively plus a spread the dollar term loan facility is subject to a 0 libor base rate floor and the euro term loan facility is subject to a 0 euribor base rate floor thus the interest rate on the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility will fluctuate when libor or euribor respectively exceeds that percentage as of december 31 2021 libor was higher than the 0 floor and euribor was lower than the 0 floor 

we use interest rate swaps from time to time to offset our exposure to interest rate movements these outstanding interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted liborbased interest payments as of december 31 2021 we had no fixedfloating interest rate swaps see note 19 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the following table presents the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the yield curve by 100 basis points including the effect of our interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 on our interest expense 



1 a decrease in interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense in 2021 or 2020 on euro debt which was lower than the 0 base rate floor under the senior secured credit facility for the entire fiscal year 2021 and 2020 but would have impacted interest expense in 2021 and 2020 on libor debt which was higher than the 0 based rate floors under the senior secured credit facility for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our global business operations changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency in 2021 and 2020 the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

we seek to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risks through a combination of normal operating activities including by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies to match expenses with revenues and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and net investment hedges in addition to mitigate the risk arising from entering into transactions in currencies other than our functional currencies we typically settle intercompany trading balances at least quarterly 

the table below presents the percentage of revenues and gross profit by functional currency for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



we utilize foreign currency denominated debt obligations supplemented from time to time with cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of the designated debt obligations and cross currency interest rate swaps are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income within our stockholders’ equity where they partially offset the currency translation effects of our investments in nonus subsidiaries which in turn partially offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally these currency translation effects and offsetting impacts of our derivatives for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are summarized in note 14 “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk arising from transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries our foreign currency forward contracts are typically shortterm and are rolled forward as necessary upon settlement as of december 31 2021 we were party to five foreign currency forward contracts all of which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value see note 19 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and rule 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 31 2021 any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives consistent with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management ’ s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the company ’ s internal control over financial reporting related to several businesses acquired during the year ended december 31 2021 as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements these businesses represented 1 of the company ’ s consolidated total assets excluding goodwill and intangibles which were included in management ’ s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 and 3 of the consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 based on that evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31 2021 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and directors and 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent and detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our executive officer and our principal financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

consistent with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management ’ s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the company ’ s internal control over financial reporting related to several businesses acquired during the year ended december 31 2021 as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements these businesses represented 1 of the company ’ s consolidated total assets excluding goodwill and intangibles which were included in management ’ s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 and 3 of the consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2021

see note 25 “subsequent events” of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction 

our industries and products 

industrial technologies and services 

our industrial technologies and services segment designs manufactures markets and services a broad range of air compression vacuum and blower products across a wide array of technologies compression vacuum and blower products are used in a wide spectrum of applications in nearly all manufacturing and industrial facilities and many service and process industries in a variety of endmarkets including infrastructure construction transportation food and beverage packaging and chemical processing 

compression products 

sales to industrial endmarkets include industrial air compression products as well as associated aftermarket parts consumables and services industrial air compressors compress air to create pressure to power machinery industrial tools material handling systems and automated equipment compressed air is also used in applications as diversified as snow making and fish farming on highspeed trains and in hospitals compressors can be either stationary or portable depending on the requirements of the application or customer 

we focus on five basic types of air compression technologies rotary screw reciprocating piston scroll rotary vane and centrifugal compressors rotary screw compressors are a newer technology than reciprocating compressors and exhibit better suitability for continuous processes due to a more compact size less maintenance and better noise profile we believe our reciprocating piston compressors provide one of the broadest ranges of pressures in the market and are supported by increasing demand across wideranging attractive endmarkets scroll compressors are most commonly seen where less oilfree air is needed and is most commonly used in medical and food applications where the need for pure clean and precise air is of great importance rotary vane compressors feature high efficiency compact compression technology and can be found throughout all sectors of industry including automotive food and beverage energy and manufacturing with specialized solutions within transit gas and snow making centrifugal compressors are most effective when in applications that demand larger quantities of oilfree air and are utilized across a wide range of industries 

vacuum products 

industrial vacuum products are integral to manufacturing processes in applications for packaging pneumatic conveying drying holding  lifting distillation evacuation forming  pressing removal and coating within each of these processes are a multitude of subapplications as an example of one such endprocess within packaging a vacuum will be used on blister packaging foil handling labeling carton erection stacking and palletizing placing stacking or transporting goods on pallets as well as central vacuum supply for entire packaging departments 

we focus on five basic types of vacuum technologies side channel liquid ring claw vacuum screw and rotary vane vacuum pumps side channel vacuum pumps are used for conveying gases and gasair mixtures in a variety of applications including laser printers packaging soil treatment textiles and food and beverage products liquid ring vacuum pumps are used for extreme conditions which prevail in humid and wet processes across ceramics environmental medical and plastics applications claw vacuum pumps efficiently and economically generate contactfree vacuum for chemical environmental and packaging applications screw vacuum pumps are a dry running technology used to reduce the carbon footprint and life cycle costs in drying and packaging applications rotary vane vacuum pumps are used for vacuum and combined pressure and vacuum applications in the environmental woodworking packaging and food and beverage endmarkets 

blower products 

blower products are used for conveying high volumes of air and gas at various flow rates and at low pressures and are utilized in a broad range of industrial and environmental applications including waste water aeration biogas upgrading and conveying pneumatic transport and dehydrating applications for food and beverage cement pharmaceutical petrochemical and mobile industrial applications in many cases blowers are a core component for the operation of the entire endusers’ systems management believes that we hold a leading position in our addressable portion of the global blower products market 

we focus on several key technologies within blower products rotary lobe screw claw and vane turbo side channel and radial blowers rotary lobe blowers screw blowers and claw and vane blowers are positive displacement technologies that have the ability to consistently move the same volume of gas or air and vary the volume flow according to the speed of the machine itself enabling it to adapt the flow condition in a flexible manner despite pressure in the system turbo blowers and side channel and radial blowers are dynamic technologies that have the ability to accelerate gas or air through an impeller and transform their kinetic energy at the discharge with some limitation on flexibility 

fluid transfer equipment products 

fluid transfer equipment products includes fluid loading systems tank truck and fleet fueling products and couplers fluid loading systems are used in the transfer and loading of hydrocarbons and certain other liquid commodity products in marine and land applications tank truck and fleet fueling products allow for safe transfer of liquid products without spillage or contamination while safeguarding the operator and the environment operators use drybreak® technology couplers and adapters to provide a secure connection for the transfer of liquid products without spillage or contamination while safeguarding the operator and the environment 

liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors 

liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors are designed for continuous duty in harsh environments including vapor and flare gas recovery equipment which recovers and compresses certain polluting gases to transmit them for further processing primarily in downstream applications the liquid ring technology utilizes a service liquid typically water oil or fuel to evacuate or compress gas by forming a rotating ring of liquid that follows the contour of the body of the pump or compressor and acts like a piston to deliver an uninterrupted flow of gas without pulsation 

precision and science technologies 

the precision and science technologies segment designs manufactures and markets a broad range of flow control products for the water and wastewater food  beverage chemical processing precision irrigation energy medical equipment laboratory vacuum and automated liquid handling endmarkets key technologies include positive displacement pumps gas liquid and precision syringe pumps automated liquid handling systems and hydrogen refueling stations 

our gas pumps are used for a wide range of applications such as aspirators blood analyzers blood pressure monitors compression therapy dental carts dialysis machines gas monitors and ventilators gas pumps transfer and compress gases and generate vacuum to enable precise flow conditions our liquid pump products are primarily used to meter and transfer both neutral and chemically aggressive fluids and our automated liquid handling products which includes syringe pumps systems and accessories that are integrated into largescale automated liquid handling systems are primarily used for clinical pharmaceutical and environmental analyses 

our products are also used for water treatment in municipal industrial and commercial applications for pressuring and dispensing in the h2 mobility segment of the hydrogen economy and for precision irrigation 

customers in the durable medical pump endmarket and the automated liquid handling endmarket develop and manufacture equipment used in a highly regulated environment requiring highly specialized technologies as a result relationships with customers are built based on a supplier’s longterm reputation expertise and deep involvement throughout a product’s evolution from concept to longterm commercialization customers value suppliers who can provide global research and development regulatory and manufacturing support as well as a sales footprint and expertise to foster close relationships with key decisionmakers at their company combined with the long product life cycle in the regulated medical device space these factors create a strong recurring base of business as a leading pump manufacturer in these markets we have established a history of innovation that enables us to work closely with our customers to create highly customized flow control solutions for their unique applications these products are missioncritical in the ultimate device in which they are deployed and remain a 

key component over the entire lifecycle of the end products the regulated market structure and nature of longtenured customer relationships enable pump manufacturers to have a highly visible recurring revenue stream from key customers 

specialty vehicle technologies 

the company designs manufactures and markets club car ® golf utility and consumer lowspeed vehicles the company has a longstanding track record as a leading premium manufacturer with strong brand recognition its customers include golf course operators resorts and hospitality sites government agencies and municipalities manufacturing and construction firms sports and other arenas colleges and universities and other commercial establishments as well as individual consumers the company sells its products primarily through independent distributors in over eighty countries worldwide and also sells its products directly to consumers 

high pressure solutions 

through the manufacture and aftermarket service of pumps and associated aftermarket parts and consumables used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well servicing applications our high pressure solutions segment is wellpositioned to capitalize on an upstream recovery particularly in the north american landbased market where our customers include marketleading hydraulic fracturing also known as pressure pumping and contract drilling service companies as well as certain other types of well service companies sales to upstream energy endmarkets consist of positive displacement pumps and associated aftermarket parts most notably fluid ends as well as consumables and services 

• positive displacement pumps in the upstream energy endmarket primarily move fluid to assist in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well servicing applications the majority of positive displacement pumps we sell are frac pumps which experience significant service intensity during use in the field and as such typically have useful life spans of approximately four to six years before needing to be replaced during that useful life such pumps will need to receive intermittent repairs as well as major overhauls in addition we also sell positive displacement pumps that are used in drilling and well servicing applications 

• fluid ends are a key component of positive displacement pumps that generate the pumping action along with other parts such as plungers and consumables such as valves seats and packing which pressurizes the fluid in the case of drilling or well servicing applications or fluid and proppant mixture in the case of hydraulic fracturing and propels such fluid or mixture out of the pump and into a series of flow lines that distribute the fluid or mixture into the well fluid ends are incorporated in original equipment pumps and due to the highly corrosive nature of the fluids and the abrasive nature of the proppants used in hydraulic fracturing operations need to be frequently replaced 

the level of profitability at which new wells can be drilled is a primary driver of drilling and completions activities including hydraulic fracturing thus demand for our high pressure solutions products is driven by the prices of crude oil and natural gas and the intensity and activity levels of drilling and hydraulic fracturing 

competition 

industrial technologies and services 

the industrial endmarkets we serve are competitive with an increasing focus on product quality performance energy efficiency customer service and local presence although there are several large manufacturers of compression vacuum and blower products the marketplace for these products remains highly fragmented due to the wide variety of product technologies applications and selling channels our principal competitors in sales of compression vacuum and blower products include atlas copco ab colfax corp flowserve corporation idex corporation and kaeser compressors inc our principal competitors in sales of fluid transfer equipment include dover corporation svt gmbh and technipfmc plc our principal competitors in the sale of liquid ring pumps and compressors are flowserve corporation and buschholding gmbh 

precision and science technologies 

competition in the market served by our precision and science technologies segment is primarily based on product quality and performance as most products must be qualified by the customer for a particular use further there is an increasing demand for more efficient healthcare solutions which is driving the adoption of premium and high performance systems our primary competitors include idex corporation dover corporation graco spx flow watsonmarlow inc knf neuberger inc and thermo fisher scientific as well as other regional and local manufacturers 

specialty vehicle technologies 

competition in the markets served by our specialty vehicles technologies segment is primarily based on product quality performance and reliability and strength of distribution network principal competitors in the golf and utility markets include ezgo and yamaha golf car company competitors in utility markets also include toro john deere and polaris competition in the market for neighborhood electric vehicles “nevs” and other small electric vehicles used for recreational and commercial purposes is more disaggregated and evolving regularly due to changes in technology and consumer preferences 

high pressure solutions 

the competitive landscape is specific to the endmarkets served our principal competitor for drilling pumps is national oilwell varco inc and for frac pumps is the weir group additionally we compete with certain smaller regional manufacturers of pumps and aftermarket parts although these are not direct competitors for most of our products 

customers and customer service 

we consider superior customer service to be one of our primary pillars of future success and view it as being built upon a foundation of critical application expertise an industry leading range of compressor pump vacuum and blower products a global manufacturing and sales presence and a longstanding reputation for quality and reliability intense customer focus is at the center of our vision of becoming the industry’s first choice for innovative and applicationcritical flow control and compression equipment services and solutions we strive to collaborate with our customers and become an essential part of their engineering process by drawing on our deep industry and application engineering experience to develop bestinclass products that are critical to the processes and systems in which they operate 

we have established strong and longstanding customer relationships with numerous industry leaders we sell our products directly to enduse customers and to certain oems and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives 

we use a direct sales force to serve enduse customers and oems because these customers typically require higher levels of technical assistance more coordinated shipment scheduling and more complex product service than customers that purchase through distributors we have distribution centers and warehouses that stock parts accessories and certain products to provide adequate and timely availability 

in addition to our direct sales force we are also committed to developing and supporting our global network of over 1000 distributors and representatives who provide a competitive advantage in the markets and industries we serve these distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and parts and provide aftermarket services to endusers while most distributors provide a broad range of products from different suppliers we view our distributors as exclusive at the product category level eg compressor vacuum and blower for example a distributor may exclusively carry our compressor technologies and also source additional components of the broader industrial system in which those products operate from other suppliers our service personnel and product engineers provide the distributors’ service representatives with technical assistance and field training particularly with respect to installation and repair of equipment we also provide our distributors with sales and product literature advertising and sales promotions orderentry and tracking systems and an annual restocking program furthermore we participate in major trade shows and directly market our offerings to generate sales leads and support the distributors’ sales personnel 

our customer base is diverse and we did not have any customers that individually provided more than 1 of 2020 consolidated revenues 

patents tradenames and other intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents tradenames copyrights trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property while in the aggregate our more than 2400 patents and our tradenames are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of our products we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent or tradename and therefore we do not consider any single patent or tradename group of patents or tradenames copyright or trade secret to be material to our business as a whole except for the ingersoll rand and gardner denver tradenames we have registered our tradenames in the countries we deem necessary or in our best interest we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and techniques and we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees as well as our suppliers and other third parties receiving such information 

pursuant to tradename license agreements cooper industries has exclusive rights to use the gardner denver tradename for certain power tools and their components meaning that we are prevented from using our mark in connection with those products 

raw materials and suppliers 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products our most significant commodity exposures are to cast iron aluminum and steel additionally we purchase a large number of motors and therefore are also exposed to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors most of our raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers we have a limited number of longterm contracts with some suppliers of key components but we believe that our sources of raw materials and components are reliable and adequate for our needs we use single sources of supply for certain castings motors and other select engineered components a disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers nevertheless we believe that we have appropriately balanced this risk against the cost of maintaining a greater number of suppliers moreover we have sought and will continue to seek cost reductions in purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases and pursuing alternate sources of supply 

human capital management 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 15900 employees of which approximately 5900 are located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions we believe that our current relations with employees are satisfactory 

we evaluate several metrics to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of our human capital management practices including voluntary turnover and engagement in 2020 our voluntary turnover for hourly employees was 78 and 67 for our salaried employees 

we are now introducing a new performance management and development process which places a heavy emphasis on manager engagement and employee ownership we highlight employee development and engagement as a standard part of our employee experience 

health  safety 

our environmental health and safety culture is focused on ensuring the health of our employees by eliminating risks of serious injuries illness and fatalities through the application of rigorous standards controls inspections and audits to help ensure that our operations and premises comply with national and local regulations 

in response to covid19 we implemented various measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers including workfromhome requirements where practical social distancing contact tracing enhanced hygiene education and deepcleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions among other measures complying with applicable governmental regulations and guidance 

competitive pay benefits and equity 

we think and act like owners we are driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and an ownership mindset inspiring us to care deeply about our neighbors and shared planet in support of this on september 21 2020 ingersoll rand announced an approximately 150 million equity grant to nearly 16000 employees worldwide 

diversity equity  inclusion 

as a newly merged company ingersoll rand reestablished its commitment to diversity equity and inclusion “dei” in 2020 we focused our efforts in a number of areas beginning with our vision 

ingersoll rand’s diversity equity and inclusion commitment for our employees partners and communities 

• we will be a dei leader within our industry that mirrors the communities and customers we serve we will leverage diversity equity and inclusion to exceed our business goals attract and retain the best talent and address today’s global challenges 

• connecting to our value of fostering inspired teams we cultivate diversity promote equity and pursue a more inclusive culture that strengthens the sense of belonging for all we expect individuals to uphold these aspirations with humility integrity and respect 

this year we engaged management leadership for tomorrow “mlt” to help solidify our strategy and identify clear initiatives to increase representation of underrepresented populations create greater growth and advancement for all and accelerate a culture of inclusion 

in terms of diverse representation we have two focus areas 1 underrepresented populations in the united states and 2 women globally our current employee base consists of 25 underrepresented populations in the us with a 2025 target to increase to 30 globally women represent 22 of our population with a goal of reaching 27 by 2025 

ingersoll rand recently launched three initial employee inclusion groups to build stronger global connections advocate for positive change and foster an inclusive culture in the organization an executive leader sponsors each group and provides guidance to establish goals in support of our company strategies culture and values to their global members 

• black employee network inclusion group 

• veterans inclusion group 

• women inclusion group 

in addition we are setting the groundwork for inclusion by training our employees on unconscious bias and how to recognize bias in the workplace and in ourselves in 2020 we also introduced a powerful initiative called “lean into change” where employees from across the company participated in culturally sensitive conversations with trust and transparency profiles in diversity journal recognized this initiative by awarding us a top 10 innovations in diversity award 

talent development and employee engagement 

we are committed to continuously improving the development and engagement of all employees in the company our last connectionsengagement survey in september 2020 included a 95 participation rate resulting in a 76 engagement level one point above the manufacturing norm as collected by glint our engagement survey partner our efforts on employee development for 2020 focused on building a strong foundation in the company we conducted “purpose and values” interactive sessions for all our employees this effort was also recognized from the profiles of diversity journal with an award of excellence for bringing to life our purpose and values we followed these sessions with training about our specific value of “we think and act like owners” in the latter training we taught our employees how they can impact our net working capital metric locally to drive greater cash conversion in the business 

as a result of all of our human capital management activities we reflect our value of “we foster inspired teams” we nurture and celebrate a culture that embraces diverse points of views backgrounds and experiences we are committed to equity in how people are treated and the opportunities available to them because we know that a workplace that cultivates a sense of inclusion belonging and respect will develop the most talented and capable employees 

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage handling emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment we believe our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area we have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws we have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes we are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes such as the us federal “superfund” and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the “superfund” or similar state laws see “item 3 legal proceedings”

the anticipated benefits of the ingersoll rand industrial acquisition may not be realized fully or at all and may take longer to realize than expected the integration process will be complex costly and timeconsuming which could adversely affect our businesses financial results and financial condition even if we are able to integrate ingersoll rand industrial successfully the merger may not result in the realization of the full benefits of anticipated cost synergies innovation operational efficiencies and incremental revenue growth opportunities that we expect to realize or these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time moreover the combined company may be unable to implement its business strategy or retain and hire key personnel see also “risks related to our business—acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results” 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and results of operations and could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in the future 

covid19 is a rapidly developing situation around the globe that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy our operating results will be subject to fluctuations based on general economic conditions and the extent to which covid19 may ultimately impact our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease and the duration of the outbreak and business closures or business disruptions for our company our suppliers and our customers 

the scale and scope of the covid19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business operating results cash flows andor financial condition described in the other risk factors contained in this report for example we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets the impact of the covid19 pandemic has caused a decrease in demand for our products and services and a sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact its revenues and profitability a portion of our revenues and operating results depend on the level of activity in the energy industry the impact of the covid19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in oil and gas prices and has negatively impacted energy sector activity and this in turn has reduced the demand for our products used in this sector and if such decreased activity continues could reduce future demand as well in addition the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial condition of our customers has and could in the future make them unable to pay for a product or service when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows further we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives the loss of or disruption in our distribution network in connection with the covid19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our 

abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business finally our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which may continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic if the impacts of the covid19 pandemic persist or worsen we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and our secured lenders including the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition to the foregoing the covid19 pandemic could also exacerbate or trigger other risks discussed herein any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

due to the covid19 pandemic we may experience different and additional risks not discussed herein such as decreased worker productivity as a result of remote working arrangements increased medical emergency or other leave an extended period of remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks including heightened cybersecurity risk remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the covid19 pandemic further we are experiencing increased costs and expenses including as a result of i conducting daily “fitnessforduty” assessments for all employees including temperature and symptoms checks and providing personal protective equipment ii the expansion of benefits to our employees including the provision of additional paid time off for employees who have contracted covid19 or are required to be quarantined and iii implementing increased health and safety protocols at all our facilities including increased cleaningsanitization of workspaces restricting visitor access mandating social distancing guidelines and increasing the availability of sanitization products us and international government responses to the covid19 outbreak have included “shelter in place” “stay at home” and similar types of orders these orders typically exempt certain individuals and businesses needed to maintain continuity of operations of critical infrastructure sectors or that are deemed “essential” or contain similar exceptions and exemptions although we believe we are currently considered an “essential” business in our operating markets if any of the applicable exceptions or exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future that would adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition furthermore to the extent these exceptions or exemptions do not extend to our key suppliers and customers this would also adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers 

our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 

in addition we believe that many of our suppliers and customers access global credit markets to provide liquidity and in some cases utilize external financing to purchase products or finance operations if our customers are unable to access credit markets or lack liquidity it may impact customer demand for our products and services 

furthermore our products are sold in many industries some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic contractions cyclical weakness in the industries that we serve could adversely affect demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance 

more than half of our sales and operations are in nonus jurisdictions and we are subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 54 of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states we have manufacturing facilities in germany the united kingdom china finland italy india and other countries we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available nonus operations and united states export sales could be adversely affected as a result of political or economic instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights credit risks currency fluctuations in particular changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar euro british pound and the chinese renminbi exchange controls changes in and uncertainties with respect to tariffs and importexport trade restrictions including changes in united states trade policy toward other countries such as the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other changes in political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries including the impacts of the uk’s national referendum 

resulting in the uk’s withdrawal from the european union royalty and tax increases nationalization of private enterprises civil unrest and protests strikes acts of terrorism war or other armed conflict shipping products during times of crisis or war and other factors inherent in foreign operations 

in addition our expansion into new countries may require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel which will divert resources from our existing business operations as we expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks associated with our international operations 

shareholder and customer emphasis on environmental social and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new risks 

our shareholders customers and employees continue to expect a more proactive response to environmental social and governance “esg” matters we may incur increased costs and may be exposed to new risks responding to these higher expectations the company recently emphasized its commitment to making a positive impact on our shared planet with the announcement of environmental goals with respect to greenhouse gas emissions renewable energy water usage and landfill waste we may face reputational challenges in the event that we are unable to achieve these goals or our esg standards do not meet those set by certain constituencies these reputational challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our revenues and operating results especially in the high pressure solutions segment depend on the level of activity in the energy industry which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices 

demand for certain products of our high pressure solutions segment particularly in the upstream energy market depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration development and production and is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and ultimately oil and natural gas prices overall the energy market is volatile as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates 

generally when worldwide demand or our customers’ expectations of future prices for these commodities are depressed the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced other factors including availability of quality drilling prospects exploration success relative production costs and political and regulatory environments are also expected to affect the demand for our products worldwide military political and economic events have in the past contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future a change in economic conditions also puts pressure on our receivables and collections 

accordingly our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period as the markets for our products have historically experienced volatility in particular orders in the high pressure solutions segment have historically corresponded to demand for oil and gas and petrochemical products and have been influenced by prices and inventory levels for oil and natural gas rig count number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and other economic factors which we cannot reasonably predict the high pressure solutions segment generated approximately 4 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 

our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct our business in many different currencies a significant portion of our revenue approximately 49 for the year ended december 31 2020 is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly currency exchange rates and in particular unfavorable movement in the exchange rates between us dollars and euros british pounds and chinese renminbi affect our operating results the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results are unpredictable because of the number of currencies in which we do business and the potential volatility of exchange rates we are also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations although historically not significant if currency controls were enacted in countries where the company generates significant cash balances these controls may limit our ability to convert currencies into us dollars or other currencies as needed or to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in the countries imposing such controls which could adversely affect our liquidity currency devaluations could also negatively affect our operating margins and cash flows 

potential governmental regulations restricting the use and increased public attention to and litigation regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing or other processes on which it relies could reduce demand for our products 

oil and natural gas extracted from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane frequently requires hydraulic fracturing recent initiatives to study regulate or otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing and processes on which it relies such as water disposal as well as litigation over hydraulic fracturing impacts could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

for example although hydraulic fracturing currently is generally exempt from regulation under the us safe drinking water act’s “sdwa” underground injection control program and is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process these include among others a number of regulations issued and other steps taken by the us environmental protection agency “epa” over the last five years including its new source performance standards issued in 2012 its june 2016 rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category and its june 2016 rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and the federal bureau of land management “blm” rule in march 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and american indian lands which was the subject of litigation and which the blm rescinded in december 2017 while the epa in the trump administration and the trump administration more generally have indicated their interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations that inhibit the development of the us oil and gas industry and have taken steps to do so it is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of litigation challenging such implementation such as the suit the state of california’s attorney general filed in january 2018 challenging the blm’s rescission of its march 2015 rule referred to above in july 2018 the federal district judge in the northern district of california where the suit was filed denied motions by the blm and several petroleum industry groups to transfer the challenge to wyoming 

moreover some states and local governments have adopted and other governmental entities are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations for example texas colorado and north dakota among others have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations states could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether following the approach taken by the state of new york in 2015 local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular some state and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity for example in december 2016 the oklahoma corporation commission’s oil and gas conservation division the “occ division” and the oklahoma geologic survey released well completion seismicity guidance which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions including mitigation following anomalous seismic activity within 125 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations in february 2017 the occ division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce earthquakes in the state and it announced further requirements involving seismic monitoring in february 2018 ongoing lawsuits have also alleged that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and natural gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal the adoption of more stringent regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and the outcome of litigation over hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face competition in the markets we serve which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we actively compete with many companies producing similar products depending on the particular product and application we experience competition based on a number of factors including price quality performance and availability we compete against many companies including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess as a result these competitors may be both domestically and internationally better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the global economy as a whole 

in addition our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new competitors entering our markets new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences pricing pressures and new government regulations if we are unable to anticipate our competitors’ development of new products and services identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services or modify existing products and service offerings in response to such competitive factors we could lose customers to competitors if we cannot compete successfully our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials and component parts substantial decreases in their availability or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

our primary raw materials directly and indirectly are cast iron aluminum and steel we also purchase a large number of motors and therefore also have exposure to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors we have longterm contracts with only a few suppliers of key components consequently we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices and availability of such raw materials factors such as supply and demand freight costs and transportation availability inventory levels of brokers and dealers the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price and availability of raw materials in addition we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings motors and other select engineered components that are critical in the manufacturing of our products from time to time in recent years we have experienced disruptions to our supply deliveries for raw materials and component parts and may experience further supply disruptions any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and therefore our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of our customer base 

we derive revenue from certain key customers in particular with respect to our oilfield service products and services the loss or reduction of significant contracts with any of these key customers could result in a material decrease of our future profitability and cash flows in addition the consolidation or vertical integration of key customers may result in the loss of certain customer contracts or impact demand or competition for our products any changes in such customers’ purchasing practices or decline in such customers’ financial condition may have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition some of our customers are significantly larger than we are have greater financial and other resources and also have the ability to purchase products from our competitors as a result of their size and position in the marketplace some of our customers have significant purchasing leverage and could cause us to materially reduce the price of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition in the petroleum product market lost sales may be difficult to replace due to the relative concentration of the customer base we are unable to predict what effect consolidation in our customers’ industries may have on prices capital spending by customers selling strategies competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with customers 

credit and counterparty risks could harm our business 

the financial condition of our customers could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables in addition financial difficulties faced by our customers as a result of an adverse economic event or other market factors may lead to cancellation or delay of orders our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a product or solution when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows 

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results 

we have acquired businesses in the past and may continue to acquire businesses or assets in the future the acquisition and integration of businesses or assets involves a number of risks the core risks are valuation negotiating a fair price for the business integration managing the process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets to extract the value and synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition regulation obtaining necessary regulatory or other government approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions and diligence identifying undisclosed or unknown liabilities or restrictions that will be assumed in the acquisition 

in addition acquisitions outside of the united states often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

• managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities 

• integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures 

• complying with nonus regulatory requirements 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights in some nonus countries 

• difficulty entering new nonus markets due to among other things consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets and 

• general economic and political conditions 

the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of an acquired company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or prospects 

dispositions create certain risks and may affect our operating results 

dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses increased expense associated with the dispositions potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share 

if dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negative effect on our cash flows andor our ability to execute our strategy in addition we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions 

as mentioned above the company has entered into an agreement to sell its hps business to aip under the agreement the company will receive cash consideration of 300 million at close for its majority interest and retain a 45 ownership interest in the hps business this transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions see note 25 “subsequent events” of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction 

the loss of or disruption in our distribution network could have a negative impact on our abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business 

we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives we rely in large part on the orderly operation of this distribution network which depends on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management we conduct all of our shipping through independent third parties although we believe that our receiving shipping and distribution process is efficient and wellpositioned to support our operations and strategic plans we cannot provide assurance that we have anticipated all issues or that events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements acquisition of distributors by a competitor consolidation within our distributor network or shipping problems will not disrupt our distribution network if complications arise within a segment of our distribution network the remaining network may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands any of these disruptions or complications could negatively impact our revenues and costs 

our ongoing and expected restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect to result from these actions our operating results could be negatively affected by our inability to effectively implement such restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives 

we continually seek ways to simplify or improve processes eliminate excess capacity and reduce costs in all areas of our operations which from time to time includes restructuring activities we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our global manufacturing sales and distribution footprint which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations we incurred restructuring charges of 929 million and 171 million in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively costs of future initiatives may be material and the savings associated with them are subject to a variety of risks including our inability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel rationalize manufacturing capacity synchronize information technology systems consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities as a result the contemplated costs to effect these initiatives may materially exceed estimates the initiatives we are contemplating may require consultation with various employees labor 

representatives or regulators and such consultations may influence the timing costs and extent of expected savings and may result in the loss of skilled employees in connection with the initiatives 

although we have considered the impact of local regulations negotiations with employee representatives and the related costs associated with our restructuring activities factors beyond the control of management may affect the timing of these projects and therefore affect when savings will be achieved under the plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all or that we will realize the projected benefits of these and other restructuring and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement our cost savings initiatives our business may be adversely affected moreover our continued implementation of cost savings initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition as we consolidate facilities and relocate manufacturing processes to lowercost regions our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customer demand and maintain a high level of quality throughout the transition failure to adequately meet customer demand or maintain a high level or quality could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel and our ability to attract and retain top talent throughout the company 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide us with uninterrupted leadership and direction the failure to retain our executive officers and other key personnel or a failure to provide adequate succession plans could have an adverse impact our future success also depends on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel at all levels of the organization the availability of highly qualified talent is limited in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the competition for talent is robust a failure to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel throughout the organization could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan 

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies our competitive position may be impaired which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation including those that drive sustainability energy reduction and the reduction andor recycling of water in our customers’ processes can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and technologies or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially and adversely affect our competitive position we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful if we do not compete successfully our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages could negatively impact our results particularly with respect to fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products 

a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract or require that we at our expense correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects because substantially all of our custom engineered product contracts are at a fixed price we face the risk that cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages may exceed erode or eliminate our expected profit margin or cause us to record a loss on our projects 

the risk of noncompliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives 

our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws regulations and policies which could result in conflicting legal requirements these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include import and export control environmental health and safety regulations data privacy requirements international labor laws and work councils and anticorruption and bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the un convention against bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials 

we are subject to the risk that we our employees our affiliated entities contractors agents or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws for which we might be held responsible particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions an actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil or criminal penalties debarment from government contracts curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions competitive or reputational harm litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives 

changes in tax or other laws regulations or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 and 2018 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property the tax act also established new tax laws that significantly affected recent and future tax years 

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to our accounting for income tax matters 

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows further the specific future impacts of the tax act on holders of our common shares are uncertain and could in certain instances be adverse we urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock 

a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 

we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting in 2013 as part of the kkr transaction we also recognized substantial goodwill and other intangible assets through the acquisition of and merger with ingersoll rand industrial as of december 31 2020 the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets net represented 110 billion or 69 of our total assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred impairments if any could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2020 we recognized an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 199 million within the industrial technologies and services segment see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken 

our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages union and work council campaigns or other labor difficulties 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 15900 employees of which approximately 5900 were located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages work stoppages have occurred and may in the future occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in addition negotiations with our union employees may 1 result in significant increases in our cost of labor 2 divert management’s attention away from operating our business or 3 break down and result in the disruption of our operations the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs andor decreased operating results 

we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants we believe that given our financial reserves and anticipated insurance recoveries the pending and potential future lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity however future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case discussed below or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome in addition even if any damages payable by us in any individual lawsuit are not material the aggregate damages and related defense costs could be material and could materially adversely affect our financial condition if we were to receive an adverse judgment in a number of these lawsuits accordingly the resolution of pending or future lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity see note 20 “contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

a natural disaster catastrophe pandemic or other event could adversely affect our operations 

some of our operations involve risks of among other things property damage which could curtail our operations for example if one or more of our manufacturing facilities are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster accident catastrophe or event our operations could be significantly interrupted impacting our ability to produce products and sell products to customers these interruptions might involve significant damage to among other things property and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to many months for a major interruption in addition disruptions in our supply chain due to natural disasters catastrophes pandemic or other events could reduce our ability to produce products and satisfy customer demand similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that provide supplies or other raw materials to our plants interruptions to our operations and supply chain could also result from pandemic which could adversely impact our workforce or that of our suppliers causing disruption to the manufacturing process or our supply chain and last a week or months depending on the severity of the disruption 

information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our customers 

our business is highly dependent on financial accounting and other dataprocessing systems and other communications and information systems including our enterprise resource planning tools we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems if any of these systems fail whether caused by fire other natural disaster power or telecommunications failure acts of cyber terrorism or war or otherwise or they do not function correctly we could suffer financial loss business disruption liability to our customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions our ability to grow could be limited although we have backup systems procedures and capabilities in place they may also fail or be inadequate further to the extent that we may have customer information in our databases any unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information could result in claims under data protection laws and regulations if any of these risks materialize our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected 

the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims which could harm our business 

customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property equipment or the environment in addition our products are integral to the production process for some endusers and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations although we maintain quality controls and procedures we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are currently adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size and we limit our liability by contract wherever possible however we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety under such laws and regulations we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or put into effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 

we use and generate hazardous substances and waste in our manufacturing operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs that are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 

our success depends in part on the creation maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents tradenames trade secrets copyrights confidentiality provisions contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights our nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of breach of such agreements or unauthorized disclosure of such information and if a competitor lawfully obtains or independently develops our trade secrets we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using such technology or information to compete with us either of which could harm our competitive position our applications for patent and tradename protection may not be granted or the claims or scope of such issued patents or registered tradenames may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products in addition effective patent copyright tradename and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our tradenames and patents in some foreign countries we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights and we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing infringement or misappropriation if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our operating results 

although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of the intellectual property of others may not be successful and from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents tradenames or other proprietary rights of such third party responding to and defending such claims regardless of their merit can be costly and timeconsuming can divert management’s attention and other resources and we may not prevail depending on the resolution of such claims we may be barred from using a specific technology or other rights may be required to redesign or reengineer a product which may require significant resources may be required to enter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may become liable for significant damages 

if any of the foregoing occurs our ability to compete could be affected or our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide as of december 31 2020 our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 2870 million “unfunded status” estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding 

obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates rates of compensation increases expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates if our assumptions prove incorrect our funding obligations may increase which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities a deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences and adversely affect our financial condition 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2020 we had total indebtedness of 38995 million and we had availability under the revolving credit facility of 9981 million our high level of debt could have important consequences including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors increasing our cost of borrowing and hampering our ability to execute on our growth strategy for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control as well as and including those factors discussed under “risks related to our business” above we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to implement any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and our secured lenders including the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

despite our level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt including offbalance sheet financing contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future including offbalance sheet financings contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities although the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 16000 

million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we also can incur additional secured indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness pay dividends make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital stock prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt make loans investments and other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of assets incur liens enter into transactions with affiliates enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets make needed capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions investments or enter into joint ventures plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies and engage in business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest 

a breach of the covenants under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal andor related interest payments and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings andor interest we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease 

we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we may enter into payfixed interest rate swap instruments from time to time to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments will result in economic losses should interest rates not rise above the payfixed interest rate in the derivative contracts we will be exposed to creditrelated losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps see note 18 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

if the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our revolving credit facility fail to extend credit under our facility or reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we have access to capital through our revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our revolving credit facility is responsible on a several but not joint basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our facility if any participant or group of participants with a significant portion of the commitments in our revolving credit facility fails to satisfy its or their respective obligations to 

extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or participants on a timely basis if at all our liquidity may be adversely affected 

the company may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from currently used financial reference rates 

libor and certain other floating rate benchmark indices to which our floating rate debt is tied including without limitation the euro interbank offered rate collectively “ibors” are the subject of recent national international and regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in a speech on july 27 2017 andrew bailey the chief executive of the financial conduct authority of the uk or the fca announced the fca’s intention to cease sustaining libor after 2021 the fca has statutory powers to require panel banks to contribute to libor where necessary the fca has decided not to ask or to require that panel banks continue to submit contributions to libor beyond the end of 2021 the fca has indicated that it expects that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain libor until the end of 2021 on november 30 2020 the fca announced that subject to confirmation following its consultation with the administrator of libor it would cease publication of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor immediately after december 31 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after june 30 2023 additionally the us federal reserve board has advised banks to stop entering into new usd libor based contracts other jurisdictions have also indicated they will implement reforms or phaseouts which are currently scheduled to take effect at the end of calendar year 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has identified the secured overnight financing rate or sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities as its preferred alternative rate for libor at this time it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the ibor benchmarks is anticipated in coming years 

as of december 31 2020 we had 39 billion of floated rate debt with maximum maturities extending past 2021 tied to ibor benchmarks there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of any ibor benchmark or of any particular replacement rate in addition any ibor benchmark may perform differently during any phaseout period than in the past as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined and any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs which could impact our results of operations and cash flows in addition we may need to renegotiate certain of our debt agreements that extend past 2021 with lenders which could require us to incur significant expense and may subject us to disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to the relevant ibor benchmark of the replacement reference rates we are assessing the impact of a potential transition from ibor however we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the transition at this time

our products and services are critical to the processes and systems in which they are utilized which are often complex and function in harsh conditions where the cost of failure or downtime is high however our products and services typically represent only a small portion of the costs of the overall systems or functions that they support as a result our customers place a high value on our application expertise product reliability and the responsiveness of our service to support our customers and 

market presence we maintain significant global scale with 65 key manufacturing facilities approximately 50 complementary service and repair centers across six continents and approximately 15900 employees worldwide as of december 31 2020 

the processcritical nature of our product applications coupled with the standard wear and tear replacement cycles associated with the usage of our products generates opportunities to support customers with our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts consumables and services customers place a high value on minimizing any time their operations are offline as a result the availability of replacement parts consumables and our repair and support services are key components of our value proposition our large installed base of products provides a recurring revenue stream through our aftermarket parts consumables and services offerings as a result our aftermarket revenue is significant representing 361 of total company revenue and approximately 428 of our combined industrial technologies and services and high pressure solutions segments’ revenue in 2020 

components of our revenue and expenses 

revenues 

we generate revenue from sales of original equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services we sell our products and deliver services directly to endusers and through independent distribution channels depending on the product line and geography revenue derived from short duration contracts is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or as services are performed certain contracts are highlyengineered and unique to customer specifications depending on the contractual terms revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when control is transferred to the customer

provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision or benefit for income taxes includes us federal state and local income taxes and all nonus income taxes we are subject to income tax in approximately 46 jurisdictions outside of the united states because we conduct operations on a global basis our effective tax rate depends and will continue to depend on the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions the availability of tax credits and nondeductible items 

items affecting our reported results 

general economic conditions and capital spending in the industries we serve 

our financial results closely follow changes in the industries and endmarkets we serve demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures depends in turn on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost in particular demand for our industrial products in our industrial technologies and services and precision and science technologies segment generally correlate with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production capacity utilization rates above 80 have historically indicated a strong demand environment for industrial equipment demand for certain businesses in our precision and science technologies segment are driven by favorable trends in healthcare spend due to an aging population requiring medical care and increased investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures in emerging economies in our high pressure solutions segment demand for our products that is influenced heavily by energy prices and the expectation as to future trends in those prices energy prices have historically been cyclical in nature and are affected by a wide range of factors in addition to energy prices demand for our upstream energy products are positively impacted by increasing global land rig count drilled but uncompleted wells the level of hydraulic fracturing intensity and activity measured by horsepower utilization and lateral lengths as well as drilling and completion capital expenditures over longer time periods we believe that demand for all of our products also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gdp around the world as augmented by secular trends in each segment our ability to grow and our financial performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations including efficiently utilizing our global sales manufacturing and distribution capabilities and engineering innovative new product applications for endusers in a variety of geographic markets 

foreign currency fluctuations 

a significant portion of our revenues approximately 49 for the year ended december 31 2020 was recognized by subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion 

factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations 

as a result of a number of factors our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below 

acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

on february 29 2020 we completed the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial we reorganized our reportable segments in connection with this transaction and formed four new reportable segments 

• industrial technologies and services – ingersoll rand industrial’s compression technologies and services “cts” and power tools and lift “ptl” businesses joined the legacy gardner denver industrial segment excluding the specialty pump businesses and the midstream and downstream portions of the gardner denver energy segment to form the new “industrial technologies and services” segment 

• precision and science technologies – ingersoll rand industrial’s precision flow systems “pfs” and aro businesses joined the legacy gardner denver medical segment and specialty pump businesses from the legacy gardner denver industrial segment to form the new “precision and science technologies” segment 

• specialty vehicle technologies – ingersoll rand industrial’s club car golf utility and consumer lowspeed vehicles business formed the new “specialty vehicle technologies” segment 

• high pressure solutions – the upstream energy portion of the legacy gardner denver energy segment was disaggregated to form the new “high pressure solutions” segment 

ingersoll rand industrial is included in our results of operations beginning on the acquisition date close of business february 29 2020 comparability between the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 will be affected by ten months of activity from ingersoll rand industrial subsequent to the date of acquisition in the year ended december 31 2020 the ingersoll rand industrial acquisition contributed 17874 million 4061 million and 7414 million of revenue to the industrial technologies and services precision and science technologies and specialty vehicle technologies segments respectively 

see note 3 “business combinations” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

other acquisitions 

part of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary flow control and compression equipment businesses which provide access to new technologies or geographies or improve our aftermarket offerings in addition to the ingersoll rand industrial transaction discussed above we have acquired several other businesses during the three year period ending december 31 2020 while these acquisitions are not individually significant or significant in the aggregate may be relevant when comparing our results from period to period 

see note 3 “business combinations” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of these acquisitions 

impact of coronavirus covid19 

we continue to assess and actively manage the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our global operations and also the operations of our suppliers and customers overall demand for our products has decreased as a result of the pandemic which impacted our operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 we are adhering to all state and country mandates and guidelines wherever we operate although certain of our facilities were closed for a period of time during the covid19 pandemic currently all our major manufacturing locations are operational in accordance with country mandates and guidelines we are taking certain actions to reduce costs and preserve cash given the rapidly changing environment the length of time the pandemic will impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers remains uncertain see “the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and results of operations and could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in the future” in part ii item 1a “risk factors” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

variability within upstream energy markets 

we sell products and services to customers in upstream energy markets primarily in the united states within our high pressure solutions segment we manufacture pumps and associated aftermarket products and services used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well service applications 

demand for upstream energy products has historically corresponded to the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and has been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity rig count drilling activity and other economic factors these factors have caused the level of demand for certain of our high pressure solutions products to change at times both positively and negatively and we expect these trends to continue in the future 

restructuring and other business transformation initiatives 

we continue to implement business transformation initiatives a key element of those business transformation initiatives was restructuring programs within our industrial technologies and services precision and science technologies specialty vehicle 

technologies and high pressure solutions segments as well as at the corporate level restructuring charges program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly 

subsequent to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial the company announced a restructuring program “2020 plan” to create efficiencies and synergies reduce the number of facilities and optimize operating margin within the merged company for the year ended december 31 2020 929 million was charged to expense related to this restructuring program 

we announced a restructuring program in the third quarter of 2018 that primarily involves workforce reductions and facility consolidations for the year ended december 31 2019 171 million was charged to expense related to this restructuring program 

stockbased compensation expense 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred stockbased compensation expense of approximately 513 million which was decreased by 05 million due to costs associated with employer taxes the increase from 2019 was primarily due to increased awards as a result of the ingersoll rand industrial acquisition as well as the 150 million equity grant to nearly 16000 employees worldwide announced in the third quarter of 2020 see note 17 “stockbased compensation” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion around our stockbased compensation expense 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred stockbased compensation expense of approximately 192 million which was increased by 15 million due to costs associated with employer taxes 

outlook 

industrial technologies and services 

the missioncritical nature of our industrial technologies and services segment products across manufacturing processes drives a demand environment and outlook that are correlated with global and regional industrial production capacity utilization and longterm gdp growth due to the uncertainty of current economic conditions associated with covid19 and its impact on end markets our nearterm visibility is limited in the fourth quarter of 2020 we had 9968 million of orders in our industrial technologies and services segment an increase of 1548 over the fourth quarter of 2019 approximately 6019 million of these orders relate to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

precision and science technologies segment 

during the covid19 pandemic the precision and science technologies segment has seen increased demand for our vacuum pump and compressor solutions used in respirator and ventilator applications demand of other products and services have been curtailed as a result of the covid19 pandemic and nearterm visibility is limited in the fourth quarter of 2020 we booked 2203 million of orders in our precision and science technologies segment an increase of 2026 over the fourth quarter of 2019 approximately 1274 million of these orders relate to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

specialty vehicle technologies segment 

during 2020 the specialty vehicle technologies segment is seeing consistent demand in golf end markets along with record demand for consumer vehicle and aftermarket parts offerings this has helped to offset demand pressure in the commercial end markets as the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the hospitality and resort industries in the fourth quarter of 2020 we had 2742 million of orders in our specialty vehicle technologies segment 

high pressure solutions segment 

the demand and outlook for the majority of our high pressure solutions products and services are influenced heavily by the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and have been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity global land rig count the number of drilled but uncompleted wells and other economic factors the covid19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have negatively impacted the global demand for oil and natural gas the ultimate duration of these conditions is unknown in the fourth quarter of 2020 we booked 388 million of orders in our high pressure solutions segment a decrease of 509 over the fourth quarter of 2019 

how we assess the performance of our business 

we manage operations through the four business segments described above in addition to our consolidated gaap financial measures we review various nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow 

we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain noncash nonrecurring and other adjustment items we believe that the adjustments applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material noncash items and about nonrecurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future adjusted net income is defined as net income loss including interest depreciation and amortization of nonacquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate adjusted ebitda and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions 

we use free cash flow to review the liquidity of our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt free cash flow is not a measure of our liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities 

management and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation such measures are provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures under gaap in addition we believe that adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers many of which also present adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity 

adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under gaap 

included in our discussion of our consolidated and segment results below are changes in revenues and adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda as total revenues and adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the constant currency revenue and adjusted ebitda growth on a yearoveryear basis constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period revenues and adjusted ebitda using corresponding prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap 

for further information regarding these measures see “item 6 selected financial data” and “nongaap financial measures” below

revenues 

revenues for 2020 were 49102 million an increase of 24583 million or 1003 compared to 24519 million in 2019 the increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial of 29349 million partially offset by lower volumes due to the effects of covid19 in our industrial technologies and services segment of 2605 million and in our high pressure solutions segment of 2205 million the percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 361 in 2020 compared to 378 in 2019 

gross profit 

gross profit in 2020 was 16134 million an increase of 7017 million or 770 compared to 9117 million in 2019 and as a percentage of revenues was 329 in 2020 and 372 in 2019 the increase in gross profit is primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial partially offset by the runoff of the fair valuation adjustments related to purchase price allocation from inventory into cost of sales lower volumes due to the effects of covid19 in our industrial technologies and 

services segment and our high pressure solutions segment the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the runoff of the fair valuation adjustments related to purchase price allocation from inventory into cost of sales and changes in segment mix 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses were 8948 million in 2020 an increase of 4584 million or 1050 compared to 4364 million in 2019 selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 182 in 2020 from 178 in 2019 this increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial increased professional and consultant fees and increased stock based compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in advertising expenses and employee related expenses including salaries and wages within our legacy business units 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets was 3958 million in 2020 an increase of 2715 million compared to 1243 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

impairment of intangible assets 

impairment of intangible assets was 199 million in 2020 due to the impairment of two tradenames in the industrial technologies and services segment see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 2172 million in 2020 an increase of 1415 million compared to 757 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher restructuring charges of 758 million higher acquisition related expenses of 435 million higher foreign currency transaction losses net of 128 million and lower shareholder litigation recoveries of 60 million 

interest expense 

interest expense was 1111 million in 2020 an increase of 222 million compared to 889 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to the addition of a 1900 million term loan entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial and the addition of a 400 million term loan entered into in the second quarter of 2020 partially offset by a decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate the weightedaverage interest rate was approximately 35 in 2020 and 54 in 2019 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

loss on extinguishment of debt was 20 million in 2020 which was related to the refinancing of the senior secured term loan facility denominated in us dollars and the senior secured term loan facility denominated in euros see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

other income net 

other income net was 80 million in 2020 an increase of 33 million compared to 47 million in 2019 the increase in other income net was primarily due to increased gains on postretirement plan investments of 105 million due to the additional defined benefit plans from the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial partially offset by increased costs in the other components of net periodic benefit cost of 61 million due to the additional defined benefit plans from the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 130 million resulting in a 670 effective tax rate in 2020 compared to a provision of 318 million resulting in a 167 effective tax provision rate in 2019 the decrease in the tax provision and the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in the pretax book income in jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates combined with significant earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates the reduction in pretax book income is mainly from the covid19 global pandemic the transaction costs associated with the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial and additional amortization and depreciation expense associated with the purchase price step up adjustments 

net income loss 

net loss was 324 million in 2020 compared to net income of 1591 million in 2019 the decrease in net income was primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses higher amortization increased other operating expenses net and higher interest expense partially offset by higher gross profit on increased revenues 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda increased 4559 million to 10176 million in 2020 compared to 5617 million in 2019 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues decreased 220 basis points to 207 in 2020 from 229 in 2019 the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to acquisitions including ingersoll rand industrial of 6911 million partially offset by lower organic sales volume of 1790 million and increased corporate costs associated with ingersoll rand industrial the decrease in adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to end market challenges in the upstream oil and gas market in our high pressure solutions segment 

adjusted net income 

adjusted net income increased 2697 million to 5990 million in 2020 compared to 3293 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to increased adjusted ebitda partially offset by an increased income tax provision as adjusted and higher depreciation and interest expenses

segment results 

as discussed above we reorganized our segments during the three month period ended march 31 2020 and no longer report under the three reportable segments of industrial energy and medical discussed below are the results of operations for the three reorganized reportable segments of industrial technologies and services precision and science technologies and high pressure solutions as well as our new specialty vehicles technologies reportable segment our corporate operations as described below are not discussed separately as any results that had a significant impact on operating results are included in the consolidated results discussion above 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability our management closely monitors segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate past performance and identify actions required to improve profitability

liquidity and capital resources 

our investment resources include cash on hand cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have the ability to seek additional secured and unsecured borrowings subject to credit agreement restrictions 

for a description of our material indebtedness see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

as of december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings 1019 million of outstanding letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility and unused availability of 9981 million 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing 

liquidity 

a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements and from the ongoing cost of operations working capital and capital expenditures 



we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 16000 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we can incur additional secured indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

our principal sources of liquidity have been existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities and prior to its termination the receivables financing agreement our principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital meet debt service requirements fund capital expenditures and finance strategic plans including possible acquisitions we may also seek to finance capital expenditures under capital leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms we continue to consider acquisition opportunities but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings we may from time to time seek to repay loans that we have borrowed including the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities based on our current level of operations and available cash we believe our cash flow from operations together with availability under the revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs our ability to do so depends on among other factors prevailing economic conditions many of which are beyond our control in addition upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in control we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness including the senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

a substantial portion of our cash is in jurisdictions outside the united states we do not assert asc 74030 formerly apb 23 indefinite reinvestment of our historical nonus earnings or future nonus earnings the company records a deferred foreign tax liability to cover all estimated withholding state income tax and foreign income tax associated with repatriating all nonus earnings back to the united states our deferred income tax liability as of december 31 2020 is 325 million which consists mainly of withholding taxes 

working capital 



net working capital increased 13942 million to 23635 million as of december 31 2020 from 9693 million as of december 31 2019 operating working capital increased 5150 million to 11180 million as of december 31 2020 from 6030 million as of december 31 2019 operating working capital as of december 31 2020 was 228 of 2020 revenues as compared to 246 as of december 31 2019 as a percentage of 2019 revenues the increase in operating working capital was primarily due to higher accounts receivable higher inventories and higher contract assets partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher contract liabilities the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial which accounts for 5999 million of accounts receivable and 182 million of contract assets as of december 31 2020 the increase in inventory was primarily attributable to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial of which 4474 million is included in the december 31 2020 balance the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial of which 4108 million is included in the december 31 2020 balance and the timing of vendor cash disbursements the increase in contract liabilities was due to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial of which 1139 million is included in the december 31 2020 balance 

cash flows 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 



1 see “nongaap financial measures” for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased 5710 million to 9143 million in 2020 from 3433 million in 2019 due to higher net income adjusted for noncash items and from cash generated from operating working capital 

operating working capital generated cash of 2633 million in 2020 compared to generating cash of 387 million in 2019 changes in account receivables generated cash of 1003 million in 2020 compared to generating cash of 547 million in 2019 changes in contract assets used cash of 126 million in 2020 compared to using cash of 91 million in 2019 changes in inventory generated cash of 1708 million in 2020 compared to generating cash of 187 million in 2019 changes in accounts payable used cash of 133 million in 2020 compared to using cash of 92 million in 2019 changes in contract liabilities generated cash of 181 million in 2020 compared to using cash of 164 million in 2019 

investing activities 

cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures of 487 million 10 of consolidated revenues and 432 million 18 of consolidated revenues in 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect capital expenditures will be in the range of 15 to 20 of consolidated revenues in 2021 cash acquired paid in business combinations was 90 million in 2020 and 120 million in 2019 net proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were 18 million and 09 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities of 3287 million in 2020 is primarily due to proceeds from longterm debt of 19801 million offset by repayments of long term debt of 16191 million and payments of debt issuance costs of 478 million also included are proceeds from stock option exercises of 227 million and a net usage of cash of 30 million related to the purchase and sale of noncontrolling interests of our india subsidiary see note 12 “stockholders equity and noncontrolling interests” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

cash used in financing activities of 115 million in 2019 reflects repayments of longterm debt of 328 million purchases of treasury stock of 186 million payments of 23 million for contingent consideration and payment of 05 million of debt issuance costs partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 427 million 

free cash flow 

free cash flow increased 5655 million to 8656 million in 2020 from 3001 million in 2019 primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities mainly driven by the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

offbalance sheet 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our future minimum payments as of december 31 2020 for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to the year ended december 31 2020 



1 as of february 28 2020 we entered into an additional 19000 million term loan in connection with the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial and as of june 29 2020 we entered into a 4000 million term loan see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details 

2 estimated interest payments for longterm debt were calculated as follows for fixedrate debt and term debt interest was calculated based on applicable rates and payment dates for variablerate debt andor nonterm debt interest rates and payment dates were estimated based on management’s determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument the increase of estimated interest payments since our previously disclosed contractual obligations on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 was due to the 19000 million term loan and 4000 million term loan as discussed above partially offset by lower interest rate 

3 purchase obligations consist primarily of agreements to purchase inventory or services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated as of december 31 2020 for this reason these amounts will not provide a complete and reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows the increase in purchase obligations since our 

previously disclosed contractual obligations on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 was due to the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial 

total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 were 2870 million the total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet line items “accrued liabilities” and “pensions and other postretirement benefits” because these liabilities are impacted by among other items plan funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets these liabilities do not represent expected liquidity needs accordingly we did not include these liabilities in the “contractual obligations” table above 

we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction we are committed to making the required minimum contributions and expect to contribute a total of approximately 01 million to our us qualified pension plans during 2021 furthermore we expect to contribute a total of approximately 33 million to our postretirement life insurance benefit plans during 2021 future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets benefit payment experience and changes if any to current funding requirements therefore no amounts were included in the “contractual obligations” table related to expected plan contributions we generally expect to fund all future contributions to our plans with cash flows from operating activities 

our nonus pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we expect to contribute a total of approximately 82 million to our nonus qualified pension plans during 2021 no amounts have been included in the “contractual obligations” table related to these plans due to the same reasons indicated above 

disclosure of amounts in the “contractual obligations” table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans we currently anticipate the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately 297 million to 421 million for the next several years and the annual benefit payments for the nonus plans to be in the range of approximately 131 million to 168 million for the next several years 

contingencies 

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including a total litigation reserve of 1314 million as of december 31 2020 with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation other than our asbestosrelated litigation reserves we only have de minimis accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to other legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth in “item 3 legal proceedings” 

critical accounting policies 

accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties certain of these policies include estimates and assumptions these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increase in tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

business combinations 

we apply the acquisition method of accounting with respect to the identifiable assets and liabilities of a business combination and record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the cost of the acquired business and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate of assumptions and about future events and uncertainties including 

significant judgments related to future cash flows discount rates competitive trends margin and revenue growth assumptions including royalty rates and customer attrition rates market comparables and others inputs used are generally obtained from historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and growth rates 

significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives the fair value estimates are based on historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but which are inherently uncertain see note 3 “business combinations” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information regarding the fair value determination of each of the classes of identifiable intangible assets determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives while certain other identifiable intangible assets have determinable lives the useful lives of identifiable intangibles with determinable useful lives is based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the competitive environment product cycles order life cycles historical customer attrition rates market share operating plans and the macroeconomic environment the costs of determinablelived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life 

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of october 1 of that year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable upon adoption of asu 201904 the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value provided the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if applicable we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss we determined fair values for all of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiples approaches which are weighted 75 and 25 respectively 

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2020 reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 to 95 additionally we assumed 30 terminal growth rates for all reporting units except a single reporting unit in which we determined it most appropriate to assume an 20 terminal growth rate due to it being closely aligned to the gdp percentage growth rate 

under the market multiples approach fair value is determined based on multiples derived from the stock prices of publicly traded guideline companies to develop a business enterprise value “bev” for our reporting units the application of the market multiples method entails the development of book value multiples based on the market value of the guideline companies the multiples are developed by first calculating the market value of equity of the guideline companies and then adjusting these multiples for cash and debt to arrive at a bev multiple identifying appropriate guideline companies and computing appropriate market multiples is subjective we considered various public companies that had reasonably similar qualitative factors as our reporting units while also considering quantitative factors such as revenue growth profitability and total assets 

the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value for two of our reporting units were between 4 and 6 primarily due to the timing of the acquisition of ingersoll rand industrial relative to our annual impairment test for all other reporting units this excess was a minimum of 25 with each reporting unit’s fair value in excess of its carrying value no goodwill impairment was recorded 

we annually test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation referred to as the relief from royalty method we estimated forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 90 to 100 terminal growth rates of 20  to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 10 to 40 as a result of this test the company recognized an impairment in 2020 of 199 million to reduce the carrying value of two tradenames in the industrial technologies and services segment 

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment 

loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected the company including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others the company was required to recognize the effect of the tax act in the period of enactment this included the determination of the transition tax remeasurement of the company’s us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the reassessment of the net realizability of the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and job act “sab 118” which allowed the company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year subsequent to the enactment date as a result the company previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act in its financial statements for 2017 and through the first nine months of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company completed its accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act and increased the total benefit taken in 2017 of 953 million to 965 million due to the tax act the total us deferred changed from a tax benefit of 896 million in 2017 to 745 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 151 million the asc 74030 formally apb 23 liability reduction relating to the permanently reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries assertion changed from a tax benefit of 690 million in 2017 to 725 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 35 million due to the policy change that occurred in 2018 the provisional onetime transition tax of 633 million in 2017 decreased to 505 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 128 million the total 12 million benefit had a 03 impact to the overall rate in 2018 

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie global intangible low taxed income “gilti” earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfc” must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income 

under us gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company has determined that it will follow the period cost method option 1 above going forward the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects this decision all of the additional calculations and rule changes found in the tax act have been considered in the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded a tax expense of 53 million in 2020 for the gilti provisions of the tax act that were effective for the first time during 2018 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to tax attribute carryforwards net of valuation allowances were 407 million and 127 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively with the increase related to the ingersoll rand industrial acquisition 

loss contingencies 

loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to asbestos and silica related litigation environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency in particular as it relates to estimating asbestos and silica contingencies there are a number of key variables and assumptions including the number and type of new claims to be filed each year the resolution or outcome of these claims the average cost of resolution of each new claim the amount of insurance available allocation methodologies the contractual terms with each insurer with whom we have reached settlements the resolution of coverage issues with other excess insurance carriers with whom we have not yet achieved settlements and the solvency risk with respect to our insurance carriers moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided 

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variablerate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable debt and from time to time use payfixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative fixed and variable portions 

as of december 31 2020 we had variable rate debt outstanding of 39331 million at a current weighted average interest rate of approximately 20 substantially all of which was incurred under our senior secured credit facility under which an aggregate of 32044 million was outstanding under the 19000 million dollar term loan b 9276 million dollar term loan and 4000 million dollar term loan series a as well as €5967 million outstanding under the €6012 million euro term loan facility 

the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility bear interest primarily based on libor and euribor respectively plus a spread the dollar term loan facility is subject to a 0 libor base rate floor and the euro term loan facility is subject to a 0 euribor base rate floor thus the interest rate on the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility will fluctuate when libor or euribor respectively exceeds that percentage as of december 31 2020 libor was higher than the 0 floor and euribor was lower than the 0 floor 

we use interest rate swaps from time to time to offset our exposure to interest rate movements these outstanding interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted liborbased interest payments as of december 31 2020 we had no fixedfloating interest rate swaps see note 18 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the following table presents the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the yield curve by 100 basis points including the effect of our interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 on our interest expense 



1 a decrease in interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense in 2020 on euribor debt which was lower than the 0 base rate floor under the senior secured credit facility for the entire fiscal year 2020 but would have impacted interest expense in 2020 on libor debt which was higher than the 0 based rate floors under the senior secured credit facility for the year ended december 31 2020 

2 a decrease in interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense in 2019 on euribor debt which was lower than the 0 base rate floor under the senior secured credit facility for the entire fiscal year 2019 but would have impacted interest expense in 2019 on libor debt which was higher than the 0 based rate floors under the senior secured credit facility for the year ended december 31 2019 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our global business operations changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency in 2020 the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2019 the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

we seek to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risks through a combination of normal operating activities including by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies to match expenses with revenues and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and net investment hedges in addition to mitigate the risk arising from entering into transactions in currencies other than our functional currencies we typically settle intercompany trading balances at least quarterly 

the table below presents the percentage of revenues and gross profit by functional currency for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 



we utilize foreign currency denominated debt obligations supplemented from time to time with cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of the designated debt obligations and cross currency interest rate swaps are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income within our stockholders’ equity where they partially offset the currency translation effects of our investments in nonus subsidiaries which in turn partially offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally these currency translation effects and offsetting impacts of our derivatives for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are summarized in note 13 “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk arising from transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries our foreign currency forward contracts are typically shortterm and are rolled 

forward as necessary upon settlement as of december 31 2020 we were party to ten foreign currency forward contracts all of which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value see note 18 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and directors and 

• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent and detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our executive officer and our principal financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

consistent with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting related to ingersoll rand industrial the company acquired ingersoll rand industrial on february 29 2020 ingersoll rand industrial represented 16 of the companys consolidated total assets excluding goodwill and intangibles which were included in managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 and 60 of the consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 

based on that evaluation management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k and as part of their audit has issued its attestation report included herein on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting see “report of independent registered public accounting firm” in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

our segments

our business is comprised of three strategic segments

industrials

we design manufacture market and service a broad range of air compression vacuum and blower products including associated aftermarket parts consumables and services across a wide array of technologies and applications for use in diverse endmarkets compressors are used to increase the pressure of air or gas vacuum products are used to remove air or gas in order to reduce the pressure below atmospheric levels and blower products are used to produce a high volume of air or gas at low pressure almost every manufacturing and industrial facility and many service and process industry applications use air compression vacuum and blower products in a variety of processcritical applications such as the operation of industrial air tools vacuum packaging of food products and aeration of waste water among others

we offer one of the broadest portfolios of compression vacuum and blower technology in our markets which we believe alongside our geographic footprint allows us to provide differentiated service to our customers globally and maintain leading positions in many of our endmarkets our compression products cover the full range of technologies including rotary screw reciprocating piston scroll rotary vane and centrifugal compressors our vacuum products and blowers also cover the full technology spectrum vacuum technologies include side channel liquid ring claw vacuum screw turbo and rotary vane vacuum pumps among others while blower technologies include rotary lobe blowers screw claw and vane side channel and radial blowers the breadth and depth of our product offering creates incremental business opportunities by allowing us to crosssell our full product portfolio and uniquely address customers’ needs in one complete solution

we sell our industrial products through an integrated network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors which is strategically tailored to meet the dynamics of each target geography or endmarket our large installed base also provides for a significant stream of recurring aftermarket revenue for example on average the useful life of a compressor is between 10 and 12 years however a customer typically services the compressor at regular intervals starting within the first two years of purchase and continuing throughout the life of the product the cumulative aftermarket revenue generated by a compressor over the product’s life cycle will typically exceed its original cost

industrial air compressors represent the largest market in which we compete in our industrials segment and is a product category for which we believe there is significant potential to drive increased sales of our aftermarket parts consumables and services we use our direct salesforce and strong distributor relationships the majority of which are exclusive to our business for the products that we sell through them to sell our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts consumables and services within our industrials segment we primarily sell through the gardner denver compair elmo rietschle and robuschi brands as well as other leading brand names

blower products

blower products are used for conveying high volumes of air and gas at various flow rates and at low pressures and are utilized in a broad range of industrial and environmental applications including waste water aeration biogas upgrading and conveying pneumatic transport and dehydrating applications for food and beverage cement pharmaceutical petrochemical and mobile industrial applications we also design manufacture market and service frac sand blowers within our industrials segment in many cases blowers are a core component for the operation of the entire endusers’ systems management believes that we hold a leading position in our addressable portion of the global blower products market

we focus on several key technologies within blower products rotary lobe screw claw and vane turbo side channel and radial blowers rotary lobe blowers screw blowers and claw and vane blowers are positive displacement technologies that have the ability to consistently move the same volume of gas or air and vary the volume flow according to the speed of the machine itself enabling it to adapt the flow condition in a flexible manner despite pressure in the system turbo blowers and side channel and radial blowers are dynamic technologies that have the ability to accelerate gas or air through an impeller and transform their kinetic energy at the discharge with some limitation on flexibility

energy

our energy segment designs manufactures markets and services a diverse range of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for a number of attractive growing market sectors with energy exposure spanning upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical applications the high cost of failure in these applications makes quality and reliability key purchase criteria for endusers and drives demand for our highly engineered and differentiated products 

upstream

through the manufacture and aftermarket service of pumps and manufacture of associated aftermarket parts and consumables used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well servicing applications our energy segment is wellpositioned to capitalize on an upstream recovery particularly in the north american landbased market where our customers include marketleading hydraulic fracturing also known as pressure pumping and contract drilling service companies as well as certain other types of well service companies sales to upstream energy endmarkets consist of positive displacement pumps and associated aftermarket parts most notably fluid ends as well as consumables and services

 

 

the level of profitability at which new wells can be drilled is a primary driver of drilling and completions activities including hydraulic fracturing thus demand for our energy and industrials products exposed to the upstream energy industry is driven by the prices of crude oil and natural gas and the intensity and activity levels of drilling and hydraulic fracturing

midstream and downstream

sales to midstream and downstream energy endmarkets consist of liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts and services our downstream energy business contributes a larger share of revenue and profitability than our midstream energy business

we focus on two basic types of midstream and downstream energy equipment fluid transfer equipment and liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors which are employed in the midstream and downstream markets respectively

 

 

petrochemical

our energy segment is positioned to capitalize on the large and growing petrochemical industry sales to petrochemical endmarkets consist of vacuum and compression process systems both of which are used in harsh continuousduty applications demand for our petrochemical industry products correlates with growth in the development of new petrochemical plants as well as activity levels therein which drive demand for aftermarket parts and services on our marketleading installed base of equipment

medical

the medical segment designs manufactures and markets a broad range of flow control products for the durable medical equipment laboratory vacuum and automated liquid handling endmarkets key technologies include gas liquid and precision syringe pumps and automated liquid handling systems

our gas pumps are used for a wide range of applications such as aspirators blood analyzers blood pressure monitors compression therapy dental carts dialysis machines gas monitors and ventilators gas pumps transfer and compress gases and generate vacuum to enable precise flow conditions our liquid pump products are primarily used to meter and transfer both neutral and chemically aggressive fluids and our automated liquid handling products which includes syringe pumps systems and accessories that are integrated into large scale automated liquid handling systems primarily for clinical pharmaceutical and environmental analyses

our products are also used in the laboratory vacuum equipment space which includes enduse chemically resistant devices used in research and commercial laboratories

customers in the durable medical pump endmarket and the automated liquid handling endmarket develop and manufacture equipment used in a highly regulated environment requiring highly specialized technologies as a result relationships with customers are built based on a supplier’s longterm reputation and expertise and deep involvement throughout a product’s evolution from concept to longterm commercialization customers value suppliers that can provide global research and development regulatory and manufacturing support as well as sales footprint and expertise to foster close relationships with key decision makers at their company combined with the long product life cycle in the regulated medical device space these factors create a strong recurring base of business as a leading pump manufacturer in these markets we have established a history of innovation that enables us to work closely with our customers to create highly customized flow control solutions for their unique applications these products are missioncritical in the ultimate device in which they are deployed and remain a key component over the entire life cycle of the end products the regulated market structure and nature of longtenured customer relationships enables pump manufacturers to have a highly visible recurring revenue stream from key customers

competition

industrials

the industrial endmarkets we serve are competitive with an increasing focus on product quality performance energy efficiency customer service and local presence although there are several large manufacturers of compression vacuum and blower products the marketplace for these products remains highly fragmented due to the wide variety of product technologies applications and selling channels our principal competitors in sales of compression vacuum and blower products in our industrials segment include atlas copco ab ingersollrand plc colfax corp flowserve corporation idex corporation and kaeser compressors inc

energy

across our product lines exposed to the energy industry the competitive landscape is specific to the endmarkets served our principal competitor for drilling pumps is national oilwell varco inc and for frac pumps is the weir group plc within upstream energy we additionally compete with certain smaller regional manufacturers of pumps and aftermarket parts although these are not direct competitors for most of our products our principal competitors in sales of fluid transfer equipment include dover corporation svt gmbh and technipfmc plc our principal competitors in the sale of liquid ring pumps and compressors are flowserve corporation and buschholding gmbh

medical

competition in the medical pump market is primarily based on product quality and performance as most products must be qualified by the customer for a particular use further there is an increasing demand for more efficient healthcare solutions which is driving the adoption of premium and high performance systems our primary competitors in medical pumps include idex corporation watsonmarlow inc knf neuberger inc and thermo fisher scientific as well as other regional and local manufacturers

customers and customer service

we consider superior customer service to be one of our primary pillars of future success and view it as being built upon a foundation of critical application expertise an industry leading range of compressor pump vacuum and blower products a global manufacturing and sales presence and a longstanding reputation for quality and reliability intense customer focus is at the center of our vision of becoming the industry’s first choice for innovative and applicationcritical flow control and compression equipment services and solutions we strive to collaborate with our customers and become an essential part of their engineering process by drawing on our deep industry and application engineering experience to develop bestinclass products that are critical to the processes and systems in which they operate

we have established strong and longstanding customer relationships with numerous industry leaders we sell our products directly to enduse customers and to certain oems and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives our energy and medical products are primarily sold directly to enduse customers and oems while approximately 50 of our industrials sales in 2019 were fulfilled through independent distributors and sales representatives

we use a direct sales force to serve enduse customers and oems because these customers typically require higher levels of technical assistance more coordinated shipment scheduling and more complex product service than customers that purchase through distributors we have distribution centers and warehouses that stock parts accessories and certain products to provide adequate and timely availability

in addition to our direct sales force we are also committed to developing and supporting our global network of over 1000 distributors and representatives who we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets and industries we serve these distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and parts and provide aftermarket services to endusers while most distributors provide a broad range of products from different suppliers we view our distributors as exclusive at the product category level eg compressor vacuum and blower for example a distributor may exclusively carry our compressor technologies and also source additional components of the broader industrial system in which those products operate from other suppliers our service personnel and product engineers provide the distributors’ service representatives with technical assistance and field training particularly with respect to installation and repair of equipment we also provide our distributors with sales and product literature advertising and sales promotions orderentry and tracking systems and an annual restocking program furthermore we participate in major trade shows and directly market our offerings to generate sales leads and support the distributors’ sales personnel

our customer base is diverse and we did not have any customers that individually provided more than 3 of 2019 consolidated revenues

patents trademarks and other intellectual property

we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property while in the aggregate our more than 600 patents and our trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of our products we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent or trademark and therefore we do not consider any single patent or trademark group of patents or trademarks copyright or trade secret to be material to our business as a whole except for the gardner denver trademark we have registered our trademarks in the countries we deem necessary or in our best interest we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and techniques and we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees as well as our suppliers and other third parties receiving such information

pursuant to trademark license agreements cooper industries has exclusive rights to use the gardner denver trademark for certain power tools and their components meaning that we are prevented from using our mark in connection with those products

raw materials and suppliers

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products our most significant commodity exposures are to cast iron aluminum and steel additionally we purchase a large number of motors and therefore are also exposed to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors most of our raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers we have a limited number of longterm contracts with some suppliers of key components but we believe that our sources of raw materials and components are reliable and adequate for our needs we use single sources of supply for certain castings motors and other select engineered components a disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers nevertheless we believe that we have appropriately balanced this risk against the cost of maintaining a greater number of suppliers moreover we have sought and will continue to seek cost reductions in purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases and pursuing alternate sources of supply

employees

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 6600 employees of which approximately 1900 are located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions we believe that our current relations with employees are satisfactory

environmental matters

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage handling emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area we have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws we have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes we are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes such as the us federal “superfund” and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the “superfund” or similar state laws see “item 3 legal proceedings”

 item 1a risk factors

the following risk factors as well as the other information included in this form 10k including “selected historical consolidated financial data” “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be carefully considered any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the selected risks described below however are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

risks related to our pending merger with ingersoll rand industrial

the pending merger may have a material adverse effect on us whether or not it is completed

on april 30 2019 we entered into the merger agreement pursuant to which on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement ingersoll rand will separate ingersoll rand industrial and then combine it with the company under the terms of the merger agreement which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of ingersoll rand and the company at the time of close ingersoll rand will receive 19 billion in cash from ingersoll rand industrial that will be funded by newlyissued debt assumed by the company in the merger upon close of the transaction existing ingersoll rand shareholders will receive 501 of the shares of the company on a fully diluted basis

the merger and the preparation for the integration of our business with ingersoll rand industrial has placed a significant burden on management and internal resources in addition if the proposed merger is completed the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all and may take longer to realize than expected the integration process will be complex costly and timeconsuming which could adversely affect our businesses financial results and financial condition even if we are able to integrate ingersoll rand industrial successfully the merger may not result in the realization of the full benefits of anticipated cost synergies innovation operational efficiencies and incremental revenue growth opportunities that we expect to realize or these benefits may not be achieved within a reasonable period of time moreover the combined company may be unable to implement its business strategy or retain and hire key personnel

we currently anticipate that we will close the merger on february 29 2020 but we cannot be certain that the customary closing conditions will be satisfied or waived on or prior to that date we may be required to pay to ingersoll rand a termination fee of approximately 176 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances see also “risks related to our business—acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results”

risks related to our business

we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers

our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy could adversely impact our revenues and profitability

in addition we believe that many of our suppliers and customers access global credit markets to provide liquidity and in some cases utilize external financing to purchase products or finance operations if our customers are unable to access credit markets or lack liquidity it may impact customer demand for our products and services

furthermore our products are sold in many industries some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic contractions cyclical weakness in the industries that we serve could adversely affect demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance

more than half of our sales and operations are in nonus jurisdictions and we are subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations

for the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 59 of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states we have manufacturing facilities in germany the united kingdom china finland italy india and other countries we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available nonus operations and united states export sales could be adversely affected as a result of political or economic instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights credit risks currency fluctuations in particular changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar euro british pound and the chinese renminbi exchange controls changes in and uncertainties with respect to tariffs and importexport trade restrictions including changes in united states trade policy toward other countries such as the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other changes in political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries including the impacts of the uk’s national referendum resulting in the uk’s withdrawal from the european union royalty and tax increases nationalization of private enterprises civil unrest and protests strikes acts of terrorism war or other armed conflict shipping products during times of crisis or war and other factors inherent in foreign operations

in addition our expansion into new countries may require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel which will divert resources from our existing business operations as we expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks associated with our international operations

our revenues and operating results especially in the energy segment depend on the level of activity in the energy industry which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices

demand for certain products of our energy segment particularly in the upstream energy market depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration development and production and is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and ultimately oil and natural gas prices overall the energy market is volatile as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates

generally when worldwide demand or our customers’ expectations of future prices for these commodities are depressed the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced other factors including availability of quality drilling prospects exploration success relative production costs and political and regulatory environments are also expected to affect the demand for our products worldwide military political and economic events have in the past contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future a change in economic conditions also puts pressure on our receivables and collections

accordingly our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period as the markets for our products have historically experienced volatility in particular orders in the energy segment have historically corresponded to demand for oil and gas and petrochemical products and have been influenced by prices and inventory levels for oil and natural gas rig count number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and other economic factors which we cannot reasonably predict the energy segment generated approximately 35 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2019

our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

we conduct our business in many different currencies a significant portion of our revenue approximately 56 for the year ended december 31 2019 is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly currency exchange rates and in particular unfavorable movement in the exchange rates between us dollars and euros british pounds and chinese renminbi affect our operating results the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results are unpredictable because of the number of currencies in which we do business and the potential volatility of exchange rates we are also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations although historically not significant if currency controls were enacted in countries where the company generates significant cash balances these controls may limit our ability to convert currencies into us dollars or other currencies as needed or to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in the countries imposing such controls which could adversely affect our liquidity currency devaluations could also negatively affect our operating margins and cash flows

potential governmental regulations restricting the use and increased public attention to and litigation regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing or other processes on which it relies could reduce demand for our products

oil and natural gas extracted from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane frequently requires hydraulic fracturing recent initiatives to study regulate or otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing and processes on which it relies such as water disposal as well as litigation over hydraulic fracturing impacts could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

for example although hydraulic fracturing currently is generally exempt from regulation under the us safe drinking water act’s “sdwa” underground injection control program and is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process these include among others a number of regulations issued and other steps taken by the us environmental protection agency “epa” over the last five years including its new source performance standards issued in 2012 its june 2016 rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category and its june 2016 rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and the federal bureau of land management “blm” rule in march 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and american indian lands which was the subject of litigation and which the blm rescinded in december 2017 while the epa in the trump administration and the trump administration more generally have indicated their interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations that inhibit the development of the us oil and gas industry and have taken steps to do so it is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of litigation challenging such implementation such as the suit the state of california’s attorney general filed in january 2018 challenging the blm’s rescission of its march 2015 rule referred to above in july 2018 the federal district judge in the northern district of california where the suit was filed denied motions by the blm and several petroleum industry groups to transfer the challenge to wyoming

moreover some states and local governments have adopted and other governmental entities are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations for example texas colorado and north dakota among others have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations states could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether following the approach taken by the state of new york in 2015 local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular some state and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity for example in december 2016 the oklahoma corporation commission’s oil and gas conservation division the “occ division” and the oklahoma geologic survey released well completion seismicity guidance which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions including mitigation following anomalous seismic activity within 125 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations in february 2017 the occ division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce earthquakes in the state and it announced further requirements involving seismic monitoring in february 2018 ongoing lawsuits have also alleged that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and natural gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal the adoption of more stringent regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and the outcome of litigation over hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we face competition in the markets we serve which could materially and adversely affect our operating results

we actively compete with many companies producing similar products depending on the particular product and application we experience competition based on a number of factors including price quality performance and availability we compete against many companies including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess as a result these competitors may be both domestically and internationally better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the global economy as a whole

in addition our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new competitors entering our markets new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences pricing pressures and new government regulations if we are unable to anticipate our competitors’ development of new products and services identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services or modify existing products and service offerings in response to such competitive factors we could lose customers to competitors if we cannot compete successfully our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected

large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials and component parts substantial decreases in their availability or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results

our primary raw materials directly and indirectly are cast iron aluminum and steel we also purchase a large number of motors and therefore also have exposure to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors we have longterm contracts with only a few suppliers of key components consequently we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices and availability of such raw materials factors such as supply and demand freight costs and transportation availability inventory levels of brokers and dealers the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price and availability of raw materials in addition we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings motors and other select engineered components that are critical in the manufacturing of our products from time to time in recent years we have experienced disruptions to our supply deliveries for raw materials and component parts and may experience further supply disruptions any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and therefore our operating results

our operating results could be adversely affected by a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of our customer base

we derive revenue from certain key customers in particular with respect to our oilfield service products and services the loss or reduction of significant contracts with any of these key customers could result in a material decrease of our future profitability and cash flows in addition the consolidation or vertical integration of key customers may result in the loss of certain customer contracts or impact demand or competition for our products any changes in such customers’ purchasing practices or decline in such customers’ financial condition may have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition some of our customers are significantly larger than we are have greater financial and other resources and also have the ability to purchase products from our competitors as a result of their size and position in the marketplace some of our customers have significant purchasing leverage and could cause us to materially reduce the price of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition in the petroleum product market lost sales may be difficult to replace due to the relative concentration of the customer base we are unable to predict what effect consolidation in our customers’ industries may have on prices capital spending by customers selling strategies competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with customers

credit and counterparty risks could harm our business

the financial condition of our customers could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables in addition financial difficulties faced by our customers as a result of an adverse economic event or other market factors may lead to cancellation or delay of orders our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a product or solution when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results

we have acquired businesses in the past and may continue to acquire businesses or assets in the future the acquisition and integration of businesses or assets involves a number of risks the core risks are valuation negotiating a fair price for the business integration managing the process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets to extract the value and synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition regulation obtaining necessary regulatory or other government approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions and diligence identifying undisclosed or unknown liabilities or restrictions that will be assumed in the acquisition

in addition acquisitions outside of the united states often involve additional or increased risks including for example

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of an acquired company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or prospects

the loss of or disruption in our distribution network could have a negative impact on our abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business

we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives we rely in large part on the orderly operation of this distribution network which depends on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management we conduct all of our shipping through independent third parties although we believe that our receiving shipping and distribution process is efficient and wellpositioned to support our operations and strategic plans we cannot provide assurance that we have anticipated all issues or that events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements acquisition of distributors by a competitor consolidation within our distributor network or shipping problems will not disrupt our distribution network if complications arise within a segment of our distribution network the remaining network may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands any of these disruptions or complications could negatively impact our revenues and costs

our ongoing and expected restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect to result from these actions our operating results could be negatively affected by our inability to effectively implement such restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives

we continually seek ways to simplify or improve processes eliminate excess capacity and reduce costs in all areas of our operations which from time to time includes restructuring activities we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our global manufacturing sales and distribution footprint which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations from 2015 to 2018 we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 607 million across our segments in 2019 we incurred restructuring charges of 171 million costs of future initiatives may be material and the savings associated with them are subject to a variety of risks including our inability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel rationalize manufacturing capacity synchronize information technology systems consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities as a result the contemplated costs to effect these initiatives may materially exceed estimates the initiatives we are contemplating may require consultation with various employees labor representatives or regulators and such consultations may influence the timing costs and extent of expected savings and may result in the loss of skilled employees in connection with the initiatives

although we have considered the impact of local regulations negotiations with employee representatives and the related costs associated with our restructuring activities factors beyond the control of management may affect the timing of these projects and therefore affect when savings will be achieved under the plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all or that we will realize the projected benefits of these and other restructuring and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement our cost savings initiatives our business may be adversely affected moreover our continued implementation of cost savings initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

in addition as we consolidate facilities and relocate manufacturing processes to lowercost regions our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customer demand and maintain a high level of quality throughout the transition failure to adequately meet customer demand or maintain a high level or quality could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel and our ability to attract and retain top talent throughout the company

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide us with uninterrupted leadership and direction the failure to retain our executive officers and other key personnel or a failure to provide adequate succession plans could have an adverse impact our future success also depends on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel at all levels of the organization the availability of highly qualified talent is limited in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the competition for talent is robust a failure to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel throughout the organization could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies our competitive position may be impaired which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and technologies or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially and adversely affect our competitive position we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful if we do not compete successfully our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages could negatively impact our results particularly with respect to fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products

a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract or require that we at our expense correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects because substantially all of our custom engineered product contracts are at a fixed price we face the risk that cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages may exceed erode or eliminate our expected profit margin or cause us to record a loss on our projects

the risk of noncompliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives

our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws regulations and policies which could result in conflicting legal requirements these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include import and export control environmental health and safety regulations data privacy requirements international labor laws and work councils and anticorruption and bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the un convention against bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials

we are subject to the risk that we our employees our affiliated entities contractors agents or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws for which we might be held responsible particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions an actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil or criminal penalties debarment from government contracts curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions competitive or reputational harm litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives

changes in tax or other laws regulations or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 and 2018 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property the tax act also established new tax laws that significantly affected 2019 2018 and 2017

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to our accounting for income tax matters

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows further the specific future impacts of the tax act on holders of our common shares are uncertain and could in certain instances be adverse we urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock

a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired

as a result of the kkr transaction we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting on july 30 2013 goodwill is recorded as the difference if any between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest intangible assets including goodwill are assigned to our reporting units based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition in accordance with gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in 2017 we recorded an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 16 million primarily within the industrials segment as of december 31 2019 the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets net represented 25427 million or 55 of our total assets a future impairment if any could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial position or results of operations see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken

our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages union and work council campaigns or other labor difficulties

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 6600 employees of which approximately 1900 were located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages work stoppages have occurred and may in the future occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in addition negotiations with our union employees may 1 result in significant increases in our cost of labor 2 divert management’s attention away from operating our business or 3 break down and result in the disruption of our operations the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs andor decreased operating results

we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits which could adversely affect our financial condition

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants we believe that given our financial reserves and anticipated insurance recoveries the pending and potential future lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity however future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case discussed below or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome in addition even if any damages payable by us in any individual lawsuit are not material the aggregate damages and related defense costs could be material and could materially adversely affect our financial condition if we were to receive an adverse judgment in a number of these lawsuits accordingly the resolution of pending or future lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity see note 20 “contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

a natural disaster catastrophe pandemic or other event could adversely affect our operations

some of our operations involve risks of among other things property damage which could curtail our operations for example if one or more of our manufacturing facilities are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster accident catastrophe or event our operations could be significantly interrupted impacting our ability to produce products and sell products to customers these interruptions might involve significant damage to among other things property and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to many months for a major interruption in addition disruptions in our supply chain due to natural disasters catastrophes pandemic or other events could reduce our ability to produce products and satisfy customer demand similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that provide supplies or other raw materials to our plants interruptions to our operations and supply chain could also result from pandemic which could adversely impact our workforce or that of our suppliers causing disruption to the manufacturing process or our supply chain and last a week or months depending on the severity of the disruption

information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our customers

our business is highly dependent on financial accounting and other dataprocessing systems and other communications and information systems including our enterprise resource planning tools we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems if any of these systems fail whether caused by fire other natural disaster power or telecommunications failure acts of cyber terrorism or war or otherwise or they do not function correctly we could suffer financial loss business disruption liability to our customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions our ability to grow could be limited although we have backup systems procedures and capabilities in place they may also fail or be inadequate further to the extent that we may have customer information in our databases any unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information could result in claims under data protection laws and regulations if any of these risks materialize our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected

the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims which could harm our business

customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property equipment or the environment in addition our products are integral to the production process for some endusers and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations although we maintain quality controls and procedures we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are currently adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size and we limit our liability by contract wherever possible however we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety under such laws and regulations we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or put into effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases

we use and generate hazardous substances and waste in our manufacturing operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs that are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury

our success depends in part on the creation maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights confidentiality provisions contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights our nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of breach of such agreements or unauthorized disclosure of such information and if a competitor lawfully obtains or independently develops our trade secrets we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using such technology or information to compete with us either of which could harm our competitive position our applications for patent and trademark protection may not be granted or the claims or scope of such issued patents or registered trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some foreign countries we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights and we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing infringement or misappropriation if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our operating results

although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of the intellectual property of others may not be successful and from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party responding to and defending such claims regardless of their merit can be costly and timeconsuming can divert management’s attention and other resources and we may not prevail depending on the resolution of such claims we may be barred from using a specific technology or other rights may be required to redesign or reengineer a product which may require significant resources may be required to enter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may become liable for significant damages

if any of the foregoing occurs our ability to compete could be affected or our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected

we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations

we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide as of december 31 2019 our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 1019 million “unfunded status” compared to 969 million as of december 31 2018 estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates rates of compensation increases expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates if our assumptions prove incorrect our funding obligations may increase which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results

we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities a deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity

risks related to our indebtedness

our substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences and adversely affect our financial condition

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2019 we had total indebtedness of 16114 million and we had availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement of 4456 million and 624 million respectively our high level of debt could have important consequences including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors increasing our cost of borrowing and hampering our ability to execute on our growth strategy for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control as well as and including those factors discussed under “risks related to our business” above we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to implement any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and our secured lenders including the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation

despite our level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt including offbalance sheet financing contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future including offbalance sheet financings contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities although the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 4500 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we also can incur additional secured indebtedness under the term loan facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the term loan facilities if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions

the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness pay dividends make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital stock prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt make loans investments and other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of assets incur liens enter into transactions with affiliates enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets make needed capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions investments or enter into joint ventures plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies and engage in business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest

a breach of the covenants under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal andor related interest payments and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings andor interest we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables financing agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease

we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments

we have entered into payfixed interest rate swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments will result in economic losses should interest rates not rise above the payfixed interest rate in the derivative contracts we will be exposed to creditrelated losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps see note 18 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

if the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our revolving credit facility fail to extend credit under our facility or reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected

we have access to capital through our revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our revolving credit facility is responsible on a several but not joint basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our facility if any participant or group of participants with a significant portion of the commitments in our revolving credit facility fails to satisfy its or their respective obligations to extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or participants on a timely basis if at all our liquidity may be adversely affected

t he company may face risk associated with the discontinuation of and transition from currently used financial reference rates

 

libor and certain other floating rate benchmark indices to which our floating rate debt is tied including without limitation the euro interbank offered rate collectively “ibors” are the subject of recent national international and regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in a speech on july 27 2017 andrew bailey the chief executive of the financial conduct authority of the uk or the fca announced the fca’s intention to cease sustaining libor after 2021 the fca has statutory powers to require panel banks to contribute to libor where necessary the fca has decided not to ask or to require that panel banks continue to submit contributions to libor beyond the end of 2021 the fca has indicated that it expects that the current panel banks will voluntarily sustain libor until the end of 2021 it is possible that the ice benchmark administration limited formerly nyse euronext rate administration limited or the iba and the panel banks could continue to produce libor on the current basis after 2021 if they are willing and able to do so but we do not currently anticipate that libor will survive in its current form or at all other jurisdictions have also indicated they will implement reforms or phaseouts which are currently scheduled to take effect at the end of calendar year 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has identified the secured overnight financing rate or sofr a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities as its preferred alternative rate for libor at this time it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the ibor benchmarks is anticipated in coming years

 

as of december 31 2019 we had 16 billion of floated rate debt with maximum maturities extending past 2021 tied to ibor benchmarks and 8250 million of interest rate swaps with maximum maturities extending past 2021 tied to ibor benchmarks there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of any ibor benchmark or of any particular replacement rate in addition any ibor benchmark may perform differently during any phaseout period than in the past as such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined and any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs which could impact our results of operations and cash flows in addition we may need to renegotiate certain of our debt agreements that extend past 2021 with lenders which could require us to incur significant expense and may subject us to disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to the relevant ibor benchmark of the replacement reference rates we are assessing the impact of a potential transition from ibor however we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the transition at this time

components of our revenue and expenses

revenues

we generate revenue from sales of our highly engineered applicationcritical products and by providing associated aftermarket parts consumables and services we sell our products and deliver aftermarket services both directly to endusers and through independent distribution channels depending on the product line and geography below is a description of our revenues by segment and factors impacting total revenues

industrials revenue

our industrials segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of air compression vacuum and blower products to customers in multiple industries and geographies a significant portion of our sales in the industrials segment are made to independent distributors the majority of industrials segment revenues are derived from short duration contracts and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered certain contracts may involve significant design engineering to customer specifications and depending on the contractual terms revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when equipment is delivered to the customer our large installed base of products in our industrials segment drives demand for recurring aftermarket support services primarily composed of replacement part sales to our distribution partners and to a lesser extent by directly providing replacement parts and repair and maintenance services to end customers revenue for services is recognized when services are performed

energy revenue

our energy segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems and engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for use primarily in upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical endmarkets across multiple geographies the majority of energy segment revenues are derived from short duration contracts and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered certain contracts with customers in the mid and downstream and petrochemical markets are higher sales value and often have longer lead times and involve more application specific engineering depending on the contractual terms revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when equipment is delivered to the customer provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable as a result the timing of these contracts can result in significant variation in reported revenue from quarter to quarter our large installed base of products in our energy segment drives demand for recurring aftermarket support services to customers including replacement parts consumables and repair and maintenance services the mix of aftermarket to original equipment revenue within the energy segment is impacted by trends in upstream energy activity in north america revenue for services is recognized when services are performed in response to customer demand for faster access to aftermarket parts and repair services we expanded our direct aftermarket service locations in our energy segment particularly in north american markets driven by upstream energy activity energy segment products and aftermarket parts consumables and services are sold both directly to end customers and through independent distributors depending on the product category and geography

medical revenue

our medical segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of highly specialized gas liquid and precision syringe pumps that are specified by medical and laboratory equipment suppliers for use in medical and laboratory applications our products are often subject to extensive collaborative design and specification requirements as they are generally components specifically designed for and integrated into our customers’ products revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred our medical segment also has limited aftermarket revenues related to certain products

expenses

cost of sales

cost of sales includes the costs we incur including purchased materials labor and overhead related to manufactured products and aftermarket parts sold during a period depreciation related to manufacturing equipment and facilities is included in cost of sales purchased materials represent the majority of costs of sales with steel aluminum copper and partially finished castings representing our most significant materials inputs stockbased compensation expense for employees associated with the manufacture of products or delivery of services to customers is included in cost of sales we have instituted a global sourcing strategy to take advantage of coordinated purchasing opportunities of key materials across our manufacturing plant locations

items affecting our reported results

general economic conditions and capital spending in the industries we serve

our financial results closely follow changes in the industries and endmarkets we serve demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures depends in turn on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost in particular demand for our industrials products generally correlates with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production capacity utilization rates above 80 have historically indicated a strong demand environment for industrial equipment in our energy segment demand for our products that serve upstream energy endmarkets are influenced heavily by energy prices and the expectation as to future trends in those prices energy prices have historically been cyclical in nature and are affected by a wide range of factors in addition to energy prices demand for our upstream energy products are positively impacted by increasing global land rig count drilled but uncompleted wells the level of hydraulic fracturing intensity and activity measured by horsepower utilization and lateral lengths as well as drilling and completion capital expenditures in the midstream and downstream portions of our energy segment overall economic growth and industrial production as well as secular trends impact demand for our products in our medical segment we expect demand for our products to be driven by favorable trends including the growth in healthcare spend and expansion of healthcare systems due to an aging population requiring medical care and increased investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures in emerging economies over longer time periods we believe that demand for all of our products also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gdp around the world as augmented by secular trends in each segment our ability to grow and our financial performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations including efficiently utilizing our global sales manufacturing and distribution capabilities and engineering innovative new product applications for endusers in a variety of geographic markets

foreign currency fluctuations

a significant portion of our revenues approximately 56 for the year ended december 31 2019 was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the united states a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion

factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations

as a result of a number of factors our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below

variability within upstream energy markets

we sell products and services to customers in upstream energy markets primarily in the united states for the upstream energy endmarket in our energy segment we manufacture pumps and associated aftermarket products and services used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well service applications

demand for upstream energy products has historically corresponded to the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and has been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity rig count drilling activity and other economic factors these factors have caused the level of demand for certain of our energy products to change at times both positively and negatively and we expect these trends to continue in the future

we believe it is helpful to consider the impact of our energy exposure to upstream energy in evaluating our 2018 and 2019 segment revenue and segment adjusted ebitda in order to better understand other drivers of our performance during those periods including operational improvements for the energy segments we assess the impact of our exposure to upstream energy as the portion of energy segment adjusted ebitda of the business unit serving the upstream energy market

restructuring and other business transformation initiatives

we continue to implement business transformation initiatives a key element of those business transformation initiatives was restructuring programs within our industrials energy and medical segments as well as at the corporate level restructuring charges program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly

we announced a restructuring program in the third quarter of 2018 that primarily involves workforce reductions and facility consolidations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 171 million and 127 million respectively were charged to expense related to this restructuring program

acquisitions

part of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary flow control and compression equipment businesses which provide access to new technologies or geographies or improve our aftermarket offerings in june 2017 within our industrials segment we acquired a leading north american manufacturer of gas compression equipment and solutions for vapor recovery biogas and other process and industrial applications for approximately 204 million net of cash acquired inclusive of an indemnity holdback of 19 million 

in february 2018 we acquired a leading global manufacturer of turbo vacuum technology systems and optimization solutions for industrial applications in our industrials segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of approximately 949 million in may 2018 we acquired a leading manufacturer of plungers and other well service pump consumable products in our energy segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of approximately 210 million inclusive of cash payments of 188 million a 20 million promissory note and a 02 million holdback in november 2018 we acquired a leading manufacturer of rotary screws and piston compressors and associated aftermarket parts in our industrials segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of 161 million inclusive of cash payments of 148 million and a 13 million holdback in december 2018 we acquired a leading manufacturer of specialty industrial pumps and associated aftermarket parts in our industrials segment for total consideration of 585 million net of cash acquired inclusive of cash payments of 578 million and a 07 million holdback

in july 2019 we acquired a company which specializes in customized pump solutions for liquid handling processes for use in medical process and industrial applications in our medical segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of 100 million inclusive of cash payments of 56 million a 16 million holdback and up to 28 million in contingent earnout provisions in august 2019 we acquired a provider of vacuum pumps blowers and compressors in our industrials segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of 70 million inclusive of cash payments of 59 million and a 11 million deferred payment

the revenues for these acquisitions subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition included in our financial results were 1376 million 962 million and 139 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the operating income for these acquisitions subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition including organic growth since acquisition included in our financial results was 191 million 83 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

see note 3 “business combinations” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion around the outstanding holdbacks for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017

stockbased compensation expense

for the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred stockbased compensation expense of approximately 28 million which was reduced by 51 million primarily due to a decrease in the estimated accrual for employer taxes related to deferred stock units “dsu” as a result of a lower per share stock price

for the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred stockbased compensation expense of approximately 192 million which was increased by 39 million due to costs associated with employer taxes see note 17 “stockbased compensation” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion around our stockbased compensation expense

income taxes

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes including the determination of the transition tax the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the reassessment of the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act in our financial statements for 2017 and through the first nine months of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act by increasing the total benefit taken in 2017 of 953 million to 965 million due to the tax act the total us deferred changed from a tax benefit of 896 million in 2017 to 745 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 151 million and the asc 74030 formerly apb 23 liability related to the permanent reinvestment of earnings in foreign subsidiaries assertion changed from a tax benefit of 690 million in 2017 to 725 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 35 million the provisional onetime transition tax of 633 million in 2017 decreased to 505 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 128 million the total 12 million benefit had a 03 impact to the overall rate in 2018

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfc” must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income

under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company has determined that it will follow the period cost method option 1 above going forward the tax provision for the twelve month period ended december 31 2019 reflects this decision all of the additional calculations and rule changes found in the tax act have been considered in the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2019  the company recorded a tax expense of 20 million in 2019 for the gilti provisions of the tax act that were effective for the first time during 2018

see note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

outlook

industrials segment

the missioncritical nature of our industrials products across manufacturing processes drives a demand environment and outlook that are correlated with global and regional industrial production capacity utilization and longterm gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 we booked 3076 million of orders in our industrials segment a decrease of 46 over the fourth quarter of 2018 or a 31 decrease on a constant currency basis  

energy segment

our energy segment has a diverse range of equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for a number of market sectors with both energy exposure spanning upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical applications

our upstream products demand environment and outlook are influenced heavily by the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and has been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity global land rig count drilled but uncompleted wells and other economic factors these factors have caused the level of demand for certain of our upstream products to change at times both positively and negatively and we expect these trends to continue in the future we believe we are well positioned to continue to benefit given our market position diverse range of equipment aftermarket parts and consumables and our service presence despite the current demand environment

our midstream and downstream products demand environment and outlook are relatively stable with attractive longterm growth trends influenced by longterm gdp growth and the continued increase in the production and transportation of hydrocarbon demand for our petrochemical industry products correlates with capital expenditures related to growth and maintenance of petrochemical plants as well as activity levels therein advancements in the development of unconventional natural gas resources in north america over the past decade have resulted in the abundant availability of locallysourced natural gas as feedstock for petrochemical plants in north america supporting longterm growth

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we booked 1718 million of orders in our energy segment a decrease of 363 over the fourth quarter of 2018 or a 354 decrease on an constant currency basis

medical segment

in 2020 we believe that demand for products and services in the medical space will continue to benefit from attractive secular growth trends in the aging population requiring medical care emerging economies modernizing and expanding their healthcare systems and increased investment globally in health solutions in addition we expect growing demand for higher healthcare efficiency requiring premium and high performance systems in the fourth quarter of 2019 we booked 637 million of orders in our medical segment a decrease of 32 over 2018 or a 18 decrease on a constant currency basis  

how we assess the performance of our business

we manage operations through the three business segments described above in addition to our consolidated gaap financial measures we review various nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow

we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain noncash nonrecurring and other adjustment items we believe that the adjustments applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material noncash items and about nonrecurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future adjusted net income is defined as net income loss including interest depreciation and amortization of nonacquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate adjusted ebitda and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions

we use free cash flow to review the liquidity of our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt free cash flow is not a measure of our liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities

management and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation such measures are provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures under gaap in addition we believe that adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers many of which also present adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity

adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under gaap

included in our discussion of our consolidated and segment results below are changes in revenues and adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda as total revenues and adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the constant currency revenue and adjusted ebitda growth on a yearoveryear basis constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period revenues and adjusted ebitda using corresponding prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

for further information regarding these measures see “item 6 selected financial data”

revenues

revenues for 2019 were 24519 million a decrease of 2379 million or 88 compared to 26898 million in 2018 the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower revenues from upstream exposed markets 88 or 2356 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies 24 or 652 million partially offset by improved pricing 14 or 368 million and higher volume in our industrials and medical segments including acquisitions 11 or 289 million the percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 378 in 2019 compared to 392 in 2018

gross profit

gross profit in 2019 was 9117 million a decrease of 1008 million or 100 compared to 10125 million in 2018 and as a percentage of revenues was 372 in 2019 and 376 in 2018 the decrease in gross profit reflects primarily the lower revenues from upstream energy exposed markets the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies and higher materials and other manufacturing costs partially offset by improved pricing the slight decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies and higher materials and other manufacturing costs in our industrials and medical segments partially offset by improved pricing

selling and administrative expenses

selling and administrative expenses were 4364 million in 2019 an increase of 18 million or 04 compared to 4346 million in 2018 selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 178 in 2019 from 162 in 2018 this increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense and other employeerelated expenses partially offset by lower professional and consultant fees

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets was 1243 million in 2019 a decrease of 15 million compared to 1258 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to intangibles that became fully amortized in 2019 partially offset by the amortization of intangibles acquired in 2018 and 2019

other operating expense net

other operating expense net was 757 million in 2019 an increase of 666 million compared to 91 million in 2018 the increase was primarily due to increased acquisition related expenses and noncash charges of 440 million foreign currency transaction losses of 81 million in 2019 compared to gains of 19 million in 2018 increased restructuring costs of 44 million and lower shareholder litigation settlement recoveries of 35 million

interest expense

interest expense was 889 million in 2019 a decrease of 107 million compared to 996 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to reduced debt as a result of prepayments in 2018 and 2019 partially offset by an increased weightedaverage rate of 54 in 2019 compared to 52 in 2018

other income net

other income net was 47 million in 2019 a decrease of 25 million compared to 72 million in 2018 the decrease in other income net was primarily due to an increase of 46 million in the other components of net periodic benefit cost and a decrease of 08 million in other financing income partially offset by increased gains on postretirement plan investments of 29 million

provision for income taxes

the provision for income taxes was 318 million resulting in a 167 effective tax rate in 2019 compared to a provision of 801 million resulting in a 229 effective tax provision rate in 2018 the decrease in the tax provision and the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in pretax book income and an increase in a benefit related to equity compensation

net income

net income was 1591 million in 2019 compared to net income of 2694 million in 2018 the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower gross profit on lower revenues and higher other operating expense net partially offset by lower interest expense and a lower provision for income taxes

adjusted ebitda

adjusted ebitda decreased 1170 million to 5648 million in 2019 compared to 6818 million in 2018 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues decreased 230 basis points to 230 in 2019 from 253 in 2018 the decrease in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to lower revenue in upstream energy exposed markets in our energy segment of 1104 million higher selling and administrative expenses of 194 million the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies of 156 million higher materials and other manufacturing costs in our industrials and medical segments of 124 million and higher volume including acquisitions being offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions in our industrials segment of 74 million partially offset by improved pricing of 368 million and higher volume in other markets in our energy segment and in our medical segment including acquisitions of 107 million

adjusted net income

adjusted net income decreased 623 million to 3324 million in 2019 compared to 3947 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted ebitda partially offset by a lower income tax provision as adjusted and lower interest expense

segment results

we classify our businesses into three segments industrials energy and medical our corporate operations as described below are not discussed separately as any results that had a significant impact on operating results are included in the consolidated results discussion above

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability our management closely monitors segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate past performance and identify actions required to improve profitability

the segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are described in note 22 “segment information” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

included in our discussion of our segment results below are changes in segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency as changes in segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements we use these measures to determine the constant currency segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda growth on a yearonyear basis constant currency segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda using prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources

our investment resources include cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement

for a description of our material indebtedness see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

as of december 31 2019 we had 44 million of outstanding letters of credit written against the revolving credit facility and 4456 million of unused availability we also had 276 million of letters of credit outstanding against the receivables financing agreement and 624 million unused availability

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing

liquidity

a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements and from the ongoing cost of operations working capital and capital expenditures

 

we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 2500 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we can incur additional secured indebtedness under the term loan facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details

our principal sources of liquidity have been existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities and the receivables financing agreement our principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital meet debt service requirements fund capital expenditures and finance strategic plans including possible acquisitions we may also seek to finance capital expenditures under capital leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms we continue to consider acquisition opportunities but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings as market conditions warrant we may from time to time seek to repay loans that we have borrowed including the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities based on our current level of operations and available cash we believe our cash flow from operations together with availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our revolving credit facility or the receivables financing agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs our ability to do so depends on among other factors prevailing economic conditions many of which are beyond our control in addition upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in control we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness including the senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

the majority of our cash is in jurisdictions outside of the united states we do not assert asc 74030 formerly apb 23 indefinite reinvestment of our historical nonus earnings or future nonus earnings the company records a deferred foreign tax liability to cover all estimated withholding state income tax and foreign income tax associated with repatriating all nonus earnings back to the united states our deferred income tax liability as of december 31 2019 is 78 million which consists mainly of withholding taxes

working capital

 

net working capital increased 2345 to 9693 as of december 31 2019 from 7348 million as of december 31 2018 operating working capital decreased 431 million to 6030 as of december 31 2019 from 6461 million as of december 31 2018 operating working capital as of december 31 2019 was 246 of 2019 revenues as compared to 240 as of december 31 2018 as a percentage of 2018 revenues the decrease in operating working capital was primarily due to lower accounts receivable and lower inventories partially offset by higher contract assets lower accounts payable and lower contract liabilities the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower sales in 2019 compared to 2018 the decrease in inventory was due to concerted supply chain optimization initiatives the increase in contract assets was due to the timing of revenue recognition and billing on our overtime contracts the decrease in contract liabilities was due to the timing of customer milestone payments for inprocess engineered to order contracts the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of vendor cash disbursements

cash provided by operating activities decreased 1012 to 3433 in 2019 from 4445 million in 2018 due to lower net income excluding noncash charges for depreciation and amortization noncash restructuring charges stockbased compensation expense foreign currency transaction losses gains net net losses gains on asset dispositions loss on the extinguishment of debt noncash change in the lifo reserve and deferred income taxes and from cash generated by reduced operating working capital

operating working capital generated cash of 387 million in 2019 compared to generating cash of 549 million in 2018 changes in account receivables generated cash of 547 million in 2019 compared to generating cash of 132 million in 2018 changes in contract assets used cash of 91 million in 2019 compared to using cash of 199 million in 2018 changes in inventory generated cash of 187 million in 2019 compared to using cash of 130 million in 2018 changes in accounts payable used cash of 92 million in 2019 compared to generating cash of 696 million in 2018 changes in contract liabilities used cash of 164 million in 2019 compared to generating cash of 50 million in 2018

investing activities

cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures of 432 million 18 of consolidated revenues and 522 million 19 of consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018 respectively we currently expect capital expenditures to total approximately 450 million to 550 million in 2020 cash paid in business combinations was 120 million in 2019 and 1863 million in 2018 net proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment were 09 million and 35 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively

financing activities

cash used in financing activities of 115 million in 2019 reflects repayments of longterm borrowings of 328 million purchases of treasury stock of 186 million payments of 23 million for contingent consideration and 05 million of debt issuance cost payments partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 427 million associated with approved stockbased compensation plans

cash used in financing activities of 3730 million in 2018 reflects repayments of longterm borrowings of 3376 million purchases of treasury stock of 407 million payments of 14 million for contingent consideration and 01 million of other items partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of 68 million associated with approved stockbased compensation plans

free cash flow

free cash flow decreased 922 million to 3001 million in 2019 from 3923 million in 2018 due to decreased cash provided by operating activities of 1012 million partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of 90 million in 2019 compared to 2018

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes our future minimum payments as of december 31 2019 for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to the year ended december 31 2019

 

 

 

total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 were 1019 million the total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet line items “accrued liabilities” and “pensions and other postretirement benefits” because these liabilities are impacted by among other items plan funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets these liabilities do not represent expected liquidity needs accordingly we did not include these liabilities in the “contractual obligations” table above

we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction we are committed to making the required minimum contributions and expect to contribute a total of approximately 01 million to our us qualified pension plans during 2020 furthermore we expect to contribute a total of approximately 03 million to our postretirement life insurance benefit plans during 2020 future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets benefit payment experience and changes if any to current funding requirements therefore no amounts were included in the “contractual obligations” table related to expected plan contributions we generally expect to fund all future contributions to our plans with cash flows from operating activities

our nonus pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we expect to contribute a total of approximately 50 million to our nonus qualified pension plans during 2019 no amounts have been included in the “contractual obligations” table related to these plans due to the same reasons indicated above

disclosure of amounts in the “contractual obligations” table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans we currently anticipate the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately 45 million to 54 million for the next several years and the annual benefit payments for the nonus plans to be in the range of approximately 102 million to 122 million for the next several years

contingencies

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet including a total litigation reserve of 1181 million as of december 31 2019 with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation other than our asbestosrelated litigation reserves we only have de minimis accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to other legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth in “item 3 legal proceedings”

critical accounting estimates

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties certain of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increase in tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of october 1 of that year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable upon adoption of asu 201904 the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value provided the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if applicable we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss we determined fair values for all of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiples approaches which are weighted 75 and 25 respectively

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2019 reporting unit valuations ranged from 90 to 100 additionally we assumed 30 terminal growth rates for all reporting units

under the market multiples approach fair value is determined based on multiples derived from the stock prices of publically traded guideline companies to develop a business enterprise value “bev” for our reporting units the application of the market multiples method entails the development of book value multiples based on the market value of the guideline companies the multiples are developed by first calculating the market value of equity of the guideline companies and then adjusting these multiples for cash and debt to arrive at a bev multiple identifying appropriate guideline companies and computing appropriate market multiples is subjective we considered various public companies that had reasonably similar qualitative factors as our reporting units while also considering quantitative factors such as revenue growth profitability and total assets

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 429 with each reporting unit’s fair value in excess of its carrying value no goodwill impairment was recorded

we annually test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation referred to as the relief from royalty method we estimated forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 90 to 100 a terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 40

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset

also see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

income taxes

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes including the determination of the transition tax the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the reassessment of the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act in our financial statements for 2017 and through the first nine month period of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act by increasing the total benefit taken in 2017 of 953 million to 965 million the total us deferred change due to the tax act went from a tax benefit of 896 million in 2017 to 745 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 151 million the asc 74030 formerly apb 23 liability related to the permanent reinvestment of earnings in foreign subsidiaries assertion changed from a tax benefit of 690 million in 2017 to 725 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 35 million resulting from a reduction in distributable profits due to restructuring and repatriations and the change in policy that occurred in 2018 the provisional onetime transition tax of 633 million in 2017 decreased to 505 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 128 million the total 12 million benefit had a 03 impact to the overall rate in 2018

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by cfcs must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income

under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” we determined that we will follow the period cost method option 1 above going forward the tax provision for the year ended december 31 2019 reflects this decision all of the additional calculations and rule changes found in the tax act have been considered in the tax provision for year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded a tax expense of 20 million in 2019 for the gilti provisions of the tax act that were effective for the first time during 2018

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered a valuation allowance is established amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to tax attribute carryforwards net of valuation allowances were 127 million and 35 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

stockbased compensation

we account for stockbased compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all stockbased payments to employees and nonemployees including grants of stock options and deferred stock units “dsu” to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards

the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the blackscholesmerton valuation model the model requires certain assumptions including the estimated expected term of the stock options the riskfree interest rate and the assumed volatility of which certain assumptions are highly complex and subjective the expected option life represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding based on managements best estimate of the timing of a liquidity event and the contractual term of the stock option as there is not sufficient trading history of our common stock we use a group of our competitors which we believe are similar to us adjusted for our capital structure in order to estimate volatility our exercise price is the stock price on the date in which shares were granted

concurrent with the company’s initial public offering in may of 2017 the company’s board authorized the grant of 55 million dsus to all permanent employees that had not previously received stockbased awards under the 2013 plan the dsus vested immediately upon grant however contain restrictions such that the employee may not sell or otherwise realize the economic benefits of the award until certain dates through april 2019 the fair value of each dsu grant under the stockbased compensation plan is estimated on the date of grant or modification using the finnerty discount for lack of marketability pricing model the discount for lack of marketability is commensurate with the period of sale restrictions related to the company’s initial public offering

prior to our initial public offering our stock price was calculated based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method forecasted cash flows are discounted to the present value at a riskadjusted discount rate the valuation analyses determine discrete free cash flows over several years based on forecast financial information provided by management and a terminal value for the residual period beyond the discrete forecast which are discounted at an appropriate rate to estimate our enterprise value under the market approach specifically the guideline public company method we select publicly traded companies with similar financial and operating characteristics as us and calculate valuation multiples based on the guideline public company’s financial information and market data subsequent to the initial public offering the estimation of our stock price is no longer necessary as we rely on the market price to determine the market value of our common stock for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 17 “stockbased compensation plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

loss contingencies

loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to asbestos and silica related litigation environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency in particular as it relates to estimating asbestos and silica contingencies there are a number of key variables and assumptions including the number and type of new claims to be filed each year the resolution or outcome of these claims the average cost of resolution of each new claim the amount of insurance available allocation methodologies the contractual terms with each insurer with whom we have reached settlements the resolution of coverage issues with other excess insurance carriers with whom we have not yet achieved settlements and the solvency risk with respect to our insurance carriers moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variablerate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable debt and from time to time use payfixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative fixed and variable portions

as of december 31 2019 we had variable rate debt outstanding net of our interest rate swaps of 7763 million at a current weighted average interest rate of 32 substantially all of which was incurred under our 24607 million senior secured credit facility under which 9276 million was outstanding under the 12855 million dollar term loan facility and €6012 million was outstanding under the €6150 million euro term loan facility

the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility bear interest primarily based on libor and euribor respectively plus a spread the dollar term loan facility is subject to a 0 libor base rate floor and the euro term loan facility is subject to a 0 euribor base rate floor thus the interest rate on the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility will fluctuate when libor or euribor respectively exceeds that percentage as of december 31 2019 libor was higher than the 0 floor and euribor was lower than the 0 floor

we use interest rate swaps to offset our exposure to interest rate movements these outstanding interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted liborbased interest payments as of december 31 2019 we were a fixed rate payer on four fixedfloating interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the liborbased index used to determine the interest rates charged on our liborbased variable rate borrowings see note 18 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the following table presents the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the yield curve by 100 basis points including the effect of our interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 on our interest expense

 

 

 

foreign currency risk

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our global business operations changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency in 2019 the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2018 the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies

we seek to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risks through a combination of normal operating activities including by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies to match expenses with revenues and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and net investment crosscurrency interest rate swaps in addition to mitigate the risk arising from entering into transactions in currencies other than our functional currencies we typically settle intercompany trading balances monthly

the table below presents the percentage of revenues and gross profit by principal currency for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

 

we utilize foreign currency denominated debt obligations supplemented from time to time with cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of the designated debt obligations and cross currency interest rate swaps are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income within our stockholders’ equity where they partially offset the currency translation effects of our investments in nonus subsidiaries which in turn partially offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally these currency translation effects and offsetting impacts of our derivatives for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are summarized in note 13 “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk arising from transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries our foreign currency forward contracts are typically shortterm and are rolled forward as necessary upon settlement as of december 31 2019 we were party to six foreign currency forward contracts all of which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value see note 18 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the table below presents for the year ended december 31 2019 the hypothetical effect of a 10 appreciation in the average exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the principal foreign currencies in which our revenues and gross profit are denominated

 item 1 business tableend 

gardner denver holdings inc is a holding company whose operating subsidiaries are gardner denver inc “gdi” and certain of gdi’s subsidiaries the holding company and its consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this annual report as “we” “us” “our” “ourselves” “company” or “gardner denver”

service marks trademarks and trade names and related designs or logotypes owned by gardner denver or its subsidiaries are shown in italics 

our company 

we are a leading global provider of missioncritical flow control and compression equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services which we sell across multiple attractive endmarkets within the industrial energy and medical industries we manufacture one of the broadest and most complete ranges of compressor pump vacuum and blower products in our markets which combined with our global geographic footprint and application expertise allows us to provide differentiated product and service offerings to our customers our products are sold under a collection of premier marketleading brands including gardner denver compair nash emco wheaton robuschi elmo rietschle and thomas which we believe are globally recognized in their respective endmarkets and known for product quality reliability efficiency and superior customer service 

these attributes along with over 155 years of engineering heritage generate strong brand loyalty for our products and foster longstanding customer relationships which we believe have resulted in leading market positions within each of our operating segments we have sales in more than 175 countries and our diverse customer base utilizes our products across a wide array of endmarkets including industrial manufacturing energy with particular exposure to the north american upstream landbased market transportation medical and laboratory sciences food and beverage packaging and chemical processing

our products and services are critical to the processes and systems in which they are utilized which are often complex and function in harsh conditions where the cost of failure or downtime is high however our products typically represent only a small portion of the costs of the overall systems or functions that they support as a result our customers place a high value on our application expertise product reliability and the responsiveness of our service to support our customers and market presence we maintain significant global scale with 41 key 

manufacturing facilities more than 30 complementary service and repair centers across six continents and approximately 6700 employees worldwide as of december 31 2018

the processcritical nature of our product applications coupled with the standard wear and tear replacement cycles associated with the usage of our products generates opportunities to support customers with our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts consumables and services customers place a high value on minimizing any time their operations are offline as a result the availability of replacement parts consumables and our repair and support services are key components of our value proposition our large installed base of products provides a recurring revenue stream through our aftermarket parts consumables and services offerings as a result our aftermarket revenue is significant representing 39 of total company revenue and approximately 43 of our combined industrials and energy segments’ revenue in 2018

our segments 

our business is comprised of three strategic segments

industrials 

we design manufacture market and service a broad range of air compression vacuum and blower products including associated aftermarket parts consumables and services across a wide array of technologies and applications for use in diverse endmarkets compressors are used to increase the pressure of air or gas vacuum products are used to remove air or gas in order to reduce the pressure below atmospheric levels and blower products are used to produce a high volume of air or gas at low pressure almost every manufacturing and industrial facility and many service and process industry applications use air compression vacuum and blower products in a variety of processcritical applications such as the operation of industrial air tools vacuum packaging of food products and aeration of waste water among others

we offer one of the broadest portfolios of compression vacuum and blower technology in our markets which we believe alongside our geographic footprint allows us to provide differentiated service to our customers globally and maintain leading positions in many of our endmarkets our compression products cover the full range of technologies including rotary screw reciprocating piston scroll rotary vane and centrifugal compressors our vacuum products and blowers also cover the full technology spectrum vacuum technologies include side channel liquid ring claw vacuum screw turbo and rotary vane vacuum pumps among others while blower technologies include rotary lobe blowers screw claw and vane side channel and radial blowers the breadth and depth of our product offering creates incremental business opportunities by allowing us to crosssell our full product portfolio and uniquely address customers’ needs in one complete solution

we sell our industrial products through an integrated network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors which is strategically tailored to meet the dynamics of each target geography or endmarket our large installed base also provides for a significant stream of recurring aftermarket revenue for example on average the useful life of a compressor is between 10 and 12 years however a customer typically services the compressor at regular intervals starting within the first two years of purchase and continuing throughout the life of the product the cumulative aftermarket revenue generated by a compressor over the product’s life cycle will typically exceed its original cost

industrial air compressors represent the largest market in which we compete in our industrials segment and is a product category for which we believe there is significant potential to drive increased sales of our aftermarket parts consumables and services we use our direct salesforce and strong distributor relationships the majority of which are exclusive to our business for the products that we sell through them to sell our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts consumables and services within our industrials segment we primarily sell through the gardner denver compair elmo rietschle and robuschi brands as well as other leading brand names

energy 

we design manufacture market and service a diverse range of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services the highly engineered products offered by our energy segment serve customers across upstream midstream and downstream energy markets as well as petrochemical processing transportation and general industrial sectors we are one of the largest suppliers of equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for the energy market applications that we serve

our positive displacement pumps are fitforpurpose to meet the demands and challenges of modern unconventional drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity particularly in the major basins and shale plays in the north american land market our positive displacement pump offering includes missioncritical oil and gas drilling pumps frac pumps and well servicing pumps in addition to sales of associated consumables used in the operation of our pumps and aftermarket parts consumables and services the products we sell into upstream energy applications are highly aftermarketintensive and so we support these products in the field with one of the industry’s most comprehensive service networks which encompasses locations across all major basins and shale plays in the north american land market this service network is critical to serving our customers and by supporting them in the field to generating demand for new original equipment sales and aftermarket parts consumables service and repair sales which in aggregate are often multiples of the cost of the original equipment

we focus on several key technologies within blower products rotary lobe screw claw and vane turbo side channel and radial blowers rotary lobe blowers screw blowers and claw and vane blowers are positive displacement technologies that have the ability to consistently move the same volume of gas or air and vary the volume flow according to the speed of the machine itself enabling it to adapt the flow condition in a flexible manner despite pressure in the system turbo blowers and side channel and radial blowers are dynamic technologies that have the ability to accelerate gas or air through an impeller and transform their kinetic energy at the discharge with some limitation on flexibility

energy 

our energy segment designs manufactures markets and services a diverse range of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for a number of attractive growing market sectors with energy exposure spanning upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical applications the high cost of failure in these applications makes quality and reliability key purchase criteria for endusers and drives demand for our highly engineered and differentiated products

upstream 

through the manufacture and aftermarket service of pumps and manufacture of associated aftermarket parts and consumables used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well servicing applications our energy segment is wellpositioned to capitalize on an upstream recovery particularly in the north american landbased market where our customers include marketleading hydraulic fracturing also known as pressure pumping and contract drilling service companies as well as certain other types of well service companies sales to upstream energy endmarkets consist of positive displacement pumps and associated aftermarket parts most notably fluid ends as well as consumables and services

 

 

the level of profitability at which new wells can be drilled is a primary driver of drilling and completions activities including hydraulic fracturing thus demand for our energy and industrials products exposed to the upstream energy industry is driven by the prices of crude oil and natural gas and the intensity and activity levels of drilling and hydraulic fracturing 

midstream and downstream 

sales to midstream and downstream energy endmarkets consist of liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts and services our downstream energy business contributes a larger share of revenue and profitability than our midstream energy business

competition 

industrials 

the industrial endmarkets we serve are competitive with an increasing focus on product quality performance energy efficiency customer service and local presence although there are several large manufacturers of compression vacuum and blower products the marketplace for these products remains highly fragmented due to the wide variety of product technologies applications and selling channels our principal competitors in sales of compression vacuum and blower products in our industrials segment include atlas copco ab ingersollrand plc colfax corp flowserve corporation idex corporation and kaeser compressors inc

energy 

across our product lines exposed to the energy industry the competitive landscape is specific to the endmarkets served our principal competitor for drilling pumps is national oilwell varco inc and for frac pumps is the weir group plc within upstream energy we additionally compete with certain smaller regional manufacturers of pumps and aftermarket parts although these are not direct competitors for most of our products our principal competitors in sales of fluid transfer equipment include dover corporation svt gmbh and technipfmc plc our principal competitors in the sale of liquid ring pumps and compressors are flowserve corporation and buschholding gmbh

medical 

competition in the medical pump market is primarily based on product quality and performance as most products must be qualified by the customer for a particular use further there is an increasing demand for more efficient healthcare solutions which is driving the adoption of premium and high performance systems our primary competitors in medical pumps include idex corporation watsonmarlow inc knf neuberger inc and thermo fisher scientific as well as other regional and local manufacturers

customers and customer service 

we consider superior customer service to be one of our primary pillars of future success and view it as being built upon a foundation of critical application expertise an industry leading range of compressor pump vacuum and blower products a global manufacturing and sales presence and a longstanding reputation for quality and reliability intense customer focus is at the center of our vision of becoming the industry’s first choice for innovative and applicationcritical flow control and compression equipment services and solutions we strive to collaborate with our customers and become an essential part of their engineering process by drawing on our deep industry and application engineering experience to develop bestinclass products that are critical to the processes and systems in which they operate

we have established strong and longstanding customer relationships with numerous industry leaders we sell our products directly to enduse customers and to certain oems and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives our energy and medical products are primarily sold directly to enduse customers and oems while approximately 50 of our industrials sales in 2018 were fulfilled through independent distributors and sales representatives

we use a direct sales force to serve enduse customers and oems because these customers typically require higher levels of technical assistance more coordinated shipment scheduling and more complex product service than customers that purchase through distributors we have distribution centers and warehouses that stock parts accessories and certain products to provide adequate and timely availability 

in addition to our direct sales force we are also committed to developing and supporting our global network of over 1000 distributors and representatives who we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets and industries we serve these distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and parts and provide aftermarket services to endusers while most distributors provide a broad range of products from different suppliers we view our distributors as exclusive at the product category level eg compressor vacuum and blower for example a distributor may exclusively carry our compressor technologies and also source additional components of the broader industrial system in which those products operate from other suppliers our service personnel and product engineers provide the distributors’ service representatives with technical assistance and field training particularly with respect to installation and repair of equipment we also provide our distributors with sales and product literature advertising and sales promotions orderentry and tracking systems and an annual restocking program furthermore we participate in major trade shows and directly market our offerings to generate sales leads and support the distributors’ sales personnel

our customer base is diverse and we did not have any customers that individually provided more than 4 of 2018 consolidated revenues

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property while in the aggregate our more than 610 patents and our trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of our products we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent or trademark and therefore we do not consider any single patent or trademark group of patents or trademarks copyright or trade secret to be material to our business as a whole except for the gardner denver trademark we have registered our trademarks in the countries we deem necessary or in our best interest we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and techniques and we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees as well as our suppliers and other third parties receiving such information

pursuant to trademark license agreements cooper industries has exclusive rights to use the gardner denver trademark for certain power tools and their components meaning that we are prevented from using our mark in connection with those products

raw materials and suppliers 

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products our most significant commodity exposures are to cast iron aluminum and steel additionally we purchase a large number of motors and therefore are also exposed to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors most of our raw materials are 

generally available from a number of suppliers we have a limited number of longterm contracts with some suppliers of key components but we believe that our sources of raw materials and components are reliable and adequate for our needs we use single sources of supply for certain castings motors and other select engineered components a disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers nevertheless we believe that we have appropriately balanced this risk against the cost of maintaining a greater number of suppliers moreover we have sought and will continue to seek cost reductions in purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases and pursuing alternate sources of supply

employees 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 6700 employees of which approximately 2100 are located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions we believe that our current relations with employees are satisfactory

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage handling emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area we have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws we have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes we are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes such as the us federal “superfund” and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the “superfund” or similar state laws see “item 3 legal proceedings”

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

the following risk factors as well as the other information included in this form 10k including “selected historical consolidated financial data” “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be carefully considered any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the selected risks described below however are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to our business 

we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers 

our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy could adversely impact our revenues and profitability

in addition we believe that many of our suppliers and customers access global credit markets to provide liquidity and in some cases utilize external financing to purchase products or finance operations if our customers are unable to access credit markets or lack liquidity it may impact customer demand for our products and services

furthermore our products are sold in many industries some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic contractions cyclical weakness in the industries that we serve could adversely affect demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance

more than half of our sales and operations are in nonus jurisdictions and we are subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations 

for the year ended december 31 2018 approximately 56 of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states we have manufacturing facilities in germany the united kingdom china finland italy india and other countries we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available nonus operations and united states export sales could be adversely affected as a result of political or economic instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights credit risks currency fluctuations in particular changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar euro british pound and the chinese renminbi exchange controls changes in and uncertainties with respect to tariffs and importexport trade restrictions including changes in united states trade policy toward other countries such as the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences as well as other changes in political policy in the united states china the uk and certain european countries including the impacts of the uk’s national referendum resulting in an election to withdraw from the european union royalty and tax increases nationalization of private enterprises civil unrest and protests strikes acts of terrorism war or other armed conflict shipping products during times of crisis or war and other factors inherent in foreign operations

in addition our expansion into new countries may require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel which will divert resources from our existing business operations as we expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks associated with our international operations

our revenues and operating results especially in the energy segment depend on the level of activity in the energy industry which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices 

demand for certain products of our energy segment particularly in the upstream energy market depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration development and production and is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and ultimately oil and natural gas prices overall the energy market is volatile as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates for example weakness in upstream energy activity in north america significantly impacted our business in 2015 and 2016

generally when worldwide demand or our customers’ expectations of future prices for these commodities are depressed the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced other factors including availability of quality drilling prospects exploration success relative production costs and political and regulatory environments are also expected to affect the demand for our products worldwide military political and economic events have in the past contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future a change in economic conditions also puts pressure on our receivables and collections

accordingly our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period as the markets for our products have historically experienced volatility in particular orders in the energy segment have historically corresponded to demand for oil and gas and petrochemical products and have been influenced by prices and inventory levels for oil and natural gas rig count number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and other economic factors which we cannot reasonably predict the energy segment generated approximately 42 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2018

our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct our business in many different currencies a significant portion of our revenue approximately 52 for the year ended december 31 2018 is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly currency exchange rates and in particular unfavorable movement in the exchange rates between us dollars and euros british pounds and chinese renminbi affect our operating results the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results are unpredictable because of the number of currencies in which we do business and the potential volatility of exchange rates we are also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations although historically not significant if currency controls were enacted in countries where the company generates significant cash balances these controls may limit our ability to convert currencies into us dollars or other currencies as needed or to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in the countries imposing such controls which could adversely affect our liquidity currency devaluations could also negatively affect our operating margins and cash flows

potential governmental regulations restricting the use and increased public attention to and litigation regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing or other processes on which it relies could reduce demand for our products 

oil and natural gas extracted from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane frequently requires hydraulic fracturing recent initiatives to study regulate or otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing and processes on which it relies such as water disposal as well as litigation over hydraulic fracturing impacts could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

for example although hydraulic fracturing currently is generally exempt from regulation under the us safe drinking water act’s “sdwa” underground injection control program and is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process these include among others a number of regulations issued and other steps taken by the us environmental protection agency “epa” over the last five years including its new source performance standards issued in 2012 its june 2016 rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category and its june 2016 rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and the federal bureau of land management “blm” rule in march 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and american indian lands which was the subject of litigation and which the blm rescinded in december 2017 while the epa in the trump administration and the trump administration more generally have indicated their interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations that inhibit the development of the us oil and gas industry and have taken steps to do so it is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of litigation challenging such implementation such as the suit the state of california’s attorney general filed in january 2018 challenging the blm’s rescission of its march 2015 rule referred to above in july 2018 the federal district judge in the northern district of california where the suit was filed denied motions by the blm and several petroleum industry groups to transfer the challenge to wyoming

moreover some states and local governments have adopted and other governmental entities are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations for example texas colorado and north dakota among others have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations states could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether following the approach taken by the state of new york in 2015 local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular some state and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity for example in december 2016 the oklahoma corporation commission’s oil and gas conservation division the “occ division” and the oklahoma geologic survey released well completion seismicity guidance which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions including mitigation following anomalous seismic activity within 125 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations in february 2017 the occ division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce earthquakes in the state and it announced further requirements involving seismic monitoring in february 2018 ongoing lawsuits have also alleged that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and natural gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal the adoption of more stringent regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and the outcome of litigation over hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we face competition in the markets we serve which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we actively compete with many companies producing similar products depending on the particular product and application we experience competition based on a number of factors including price quality performance and availability we compete against many companies including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess as a result these competitors may be both domestically and internationally better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the global economy as a whole

in addition our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new competitors entering our markets new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences pricing pressures and new government regulations if we are unable to anticipate our competitors’ development of new products and services identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services or modify existing products and service offerings in response to such competitive factors we could lose customers to competitors if we cannot compete successfully our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected

large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials and component parts substantial decreases in their availability or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

our primary raw materials directly and indirectly are cast iron aluminum and steel we also purchase a large number of motors and therefore also have exposure to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors we have longterm contracts with only a few suppliers of key components consequently we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices and availability of such raw materials factors such as supply and demand freight costs and transportation availability inventory levels of brokers and dealers the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price and availability of raw materials in addition we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings motors and other select engineered components that are critical in the manufacturing of our products from time to time in recent years we have experienced disruptions to our supply deliveries for raw materials and component parts and may experience further supply disruptions any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and therefore our operating results

our operating results could be adversely affected by a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of our customer base 

we derive revenue from certain key customers in particular with respect to our oilfield service products and services the loss or reduction of significant contracts with any of these key customers could result in a material decrease of our future profitability and cash flows in addition the consolidation or vertical integration of key customers may result in the loss of certain customer contracts or impact demand or competition for our products any changes in such customers’ purchasing practices or decline in such customers’ financial condition may have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition some of our customers are significantly larger than we are have greater financial and other resources and also have the ability to purchase products from our competitors as a result of their size and position in the marketplace some of our customers have significant purchasing leverage and could cause us to materially reduce the price of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition in the petroleum product market lost sales may be difficult to replace due to the relative concentration of the customer base we are unable to predict what effect consolidation in our customers’ industries may have on prices capital spending by customers selling strategies competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with customers

credit and counterparty risks could harm our business 

the financial condition of our customers could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables in addition financial difficulties faced by our customers as a result of an adverse economic event or other market factors may lead to cancellation or delay of orders our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a product or solution when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results 

we have acquired businesses in the past and may continue to acquire businesses or assets in the future the acquisition and integration of businesses or assets involves a number of risks the core risks are valuation negotiating a fair price for the business integration managing the process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets to extract the value and synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition regulation obtaining necessary regulatory or other government approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions and diligence identifying undisclosed or unknown liabilities or restrictions that will be assumed in the acquisition

in addition acquisitions outside of the united states often involve additional or increased risks including for example

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of an acquired company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or prospects

the loss of or disruption in our distribution network could have a negative impact on our abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business 

we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives we rely in large part on the orderly operation of this distribution network which depends on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management we conduct all of our shipping through independent third parties although we believe that our receiving shipping and distribution process is efficient and wellpositioned to support our operations and strategic plans we cannot provide assurance that we have anticipated all issues or that events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements acquisition of distributors by a competitor consolidation within our distributor network or shipping problems will not disrupt our distribution network if complications arise within a segment of our distribution network the remaining network may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands any of these disruptions or complications could negatively impact our revenues and costs

our ongoing and expected restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect to result from these actions our operating results could be negatively affected by our inability to effectively implement such restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives 

we continually seek ways to simplify or improve processes eliminate excess capacity and reduce costs in all areas of our operations which from time to time includes restructuring activities we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our global manufacturing sales and distribution footprint which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations from 2015 to 2017 we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 480 million across our segments in 2018 we incurred restructuring charges of 127 million costs of future initiatives may be material and the savings associated with them are subject to a variety of risks including our inability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel rationalize manufacturing capacity synchronize information technology systems consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities as a result the contemplated costs to effect these initiatives may materially exceed estimates the initiatives we are contemplating may require consultation with various employees labor representatives or regulators and such consultations may influence the timing costs and extent of expected savings and may result in the loss of skilled employees in connection with the initiatives

although we have considered the impact of local regulations negotiations with employee representatives and the related costs associated with our restructuring activities factors beyond the control of management may affect the timing of these projects and therefore affect when savings will be achieved under the plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all or that we will realize the projected benefits of these and other restructuring and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement our cost savings initiatives our business may be adversely affected moreover our continued implementation of cost savings initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

in addition as we consolidate facilities and relocate manufacturing processes to lowercost regions our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customer demand and maintain a high level of quality throughout the transition failure to adequately meet customer demand or maintain a high level or quality could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel and our ability to attract and retain top talent throughout the company 

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide us with uninterrupted leadership and direction the failure to retain our executive officers and other key personnel or a failure to provide adequate succession plans could have an adverse impact our future success also depends on our ability to attract retain and develop qualified personnel at all levels of the organization the availability of highly qualified talent is limited in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operated and the competition for talent is robust a failure to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel throughout the organization could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies our competitive position may be impaired which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and technologies or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially and adversely affect our competitive position we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful if we do not compete successfully our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages could negatively impact our results particularly with respect to fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products 

a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract or require that we at our expense correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects because substantially all of our custom engineered product contracts are at a fixed price we face the risk that cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages may exceed erode or eliminate our expected profit margin or cause us to record a loss on our projects

the risk of noncompliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives 

our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws regulations and policies which could result in conflicting legal requirements these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include import and export control environmental health and safety regulations data privacy requirements international labor laws and work councils and anticorruption and bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the un convention against bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials

we are subject to the risk that we our employees our affiliated entities contractors agents or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws for which we might be held responsible particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions an actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil or criminal penalties debarment from government contracts curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions competitive or reputational harm litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives

changes in tax or other laws regulations or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our effective tax rate and cash taxes paid or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 and 2018 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property the tax act also established new tax laws that significantly affected 2018 and 2017

while we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to our accounting for income tax matters

the inability to realize any anticipated tax benefits related to our operations and corporate structure could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows further the specific future impacts of the tax act on holders of our common shares are uncertain and could in certain instances be adverse we urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock

a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 

as a result of the kkr transaction we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting on july 30 2013 goodwill is recorded as the difference if any between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest intangible assets including goodwill are assigned to our reporting units based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition in accordance with gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in 2017 we recorded an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 16 million primarily within the industrials segment in 2016 we recorded an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 253 million primarily within the industrials segment as of december 31 2018 the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets net represented 26579 million or 59 of our total assets a future impairment if any could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial position or results of operations see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken

our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages union and work council campaigns or other labor difficulties 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 6700 employees of which approximately 2100 were located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages work stoppages have occurred and may in the future occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in addition negotiations with our union employees may 1 result in significant increases in our cost of labor 2 divert management’s attention away from operating our business or 3 break down and result in the disruption of our operations the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs andor decreased operating results

we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits which could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants we believe that given our financial reserves and anticipated insurance recoveries the pending and potential future lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity however future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case discussed below or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome in addition even if any damages payable by us in any individual lawsuit are not material the aggregate damages and related defense costs could be material and could materially adversely affect our financial condition if we were to receive an adverse judgment in a number of these lawsuits accordingly the resolution of pending or future lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity see “business—legal proceedings—asbestos and silicarelated litigation” 

a natural disaster catastrophe or other event could result in severe property damage which could adversely affect our operations 

some of our operations involve risks of among other things property damage which could curtail our operations for example disruptions in operations or damage to a manufacturing plant could reduce our ability to produce products and satisfy customer demand if one of more of our manufacturing facilities are damaged by severe weather 

or any other disaster accident catastrophe or event our operations could be significantly interrupted similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that provide supplies or other raw materials to our plants or other stoppages arising from factors beyond our control these interruptions might involve significant damage to among other things property and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to many months for a major interruption

information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our customers 

our business is highly dependent on financial accounting and other dataprocessing systems and other communications and information systems including our enterprise resource planning tools we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems if any of these systems fail whether caused by fire other natural disaster power or telecommunications failure acts of cyber terrorism or war or otherwise or they do not function correctly we could suffer financial loss business disruption liability to our customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions our ability to grow could be limited although we have backup systems procedures and capabilities in place they may also fail or be inadequate further to the extent that we may have customer information in our databases any unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information could result in claims under data protection laws and regulations if any of these risks materialize our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected

the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims which could harm our business 

customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property equipment or the environment in addition our products are integral to the production process for some endusers and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations although we maintain quality controls and procedures we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are currently adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size and we limit our liability by contract wherever possible however we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety under such laws and regulations we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or put into effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases

we use and generate hazardous substances and waste in our manufacturing operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs that are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 

our success depends in part on the creation maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights confidentiality 

provisions contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights our nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of breach of such agreements or unauthorized disclosure of such information and if a competitor lawfully obtains or independently develops our trade secrets we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using such technology or information to compete with us either of which could harm our competitive position our applications for patent and trademark protection may not be granted or the claims or scope of such issued patents or registered trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some foreign countries we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights and we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing infringement or misappropriation if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our operating results

although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of the intellectual property of others may not be successful and from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party responding to and defending such claims regardless of their merit can be costly and timeconsuming can divert management’s attention and other resources and we may not prevail depending on the resolution of such claims we may be barred from using a specific technology or other rights may be required to redesign or reengineer a product which may require significant resources may be required to enter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may become liable for significant damages

if any of the foregoing occurs our ability to compete could be affected or our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected

we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide as of december 31 2018 our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 969 million “unfunded status” compared to 972 million as of december 31 2017 estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates rates of compensation increases expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates if our assumptions prove incorrect our funding obligations may increase which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results

we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities a deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences and adversely affect our financial condition 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2018 we had total indebtedness of 16721 million and we had availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement of 2634 million and 833 million respectively our high level of debt could have important consequences including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the 

industries in which we compete placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors increasing our cost of borrowing and hampering our ability to execute on our growth strategy for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control as well as and including those factors discussed under “risks related to our business” above we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to implement any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and our secured lenders including the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation

despite our level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt including offbalance sheet financing contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future including offbalance sheet financings contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities although the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 2500 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we also can incur additional secured indebtedness under the term loan facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the term loan facilities if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness pay dividends make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital stock prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt make loans investments and other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of assets incur liens enter into transactions with affiliates enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets make needed capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions investments or enter into joint ventures plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies and engage in business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest

a breach of the covenants under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal andor related interest payments and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a 

crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings andor interest we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables financing agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease

we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments 

we have entered into payfixed interest rate swaps instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments will result in economic losses should interest rates not rise above the payfixed interest rate in the derivative contracts we will be exposed to creditrelated losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps see note 17 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

if the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our revolving credit facility fail to extend credit under our facility or reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we have access to capital through our revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our revolving credit facility is responsible on a several but not joint basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our facility if any participant or group of participants with a significant portion of the commitments in our revolving credit facility fails to satisfy its or their respective obligations to extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or participants on a timely basis if at all our liquidity may be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth below

environmental matters 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage handling emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area we have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws we have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes we are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes such as the us federal “superfund” and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the “superfund” or similar state laws

asbestos and silicarelated litigation 

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestosrelated and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants our predecessors sometimes manufactured distributed andor sold products allegedly at issue in these pending asbestos and silicarelated lawsuits the “products” however neither we nor our predecessors ever mined manufactured mixed produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits moreover the asbestoscontaining components of the products if any were enclosed within the subject products

although we have never mined manufactured mixed produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica many of the companies that did engage in such activities or produced such products are no longer in operation this has led to law firms seeking potential alternative companies to name in lawsuits where there has been an asbestos or silica related injury however in our opinion based on our experience to date the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility

we believe that the pending and future asbestos and silicarelated lawsuits are not likely to in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity based on our anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters the limited potential asbestos exposure from the products described above our opinion based on our experience to date that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which we otherwise bear responsibility various potential defenses available to us with respect to such matters and our prior disposition of comparable matters however inherent uncertainties of litigation and future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case discussed below or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome while the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain based on presently known facts experience and circumstances we believe that the amounts accrued on our consolidated balance sheets are adequate and that the liabilities arising from the asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to include a total litigation reserve of 1058 million and 1056 million as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation asbestosrelated defense costs are excluded from the asbestos claims liability and are recorded separately as an operating expense as services are incurred we currently expect to continue to incur significant asbestosrelated defense costs in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be material to the our consolidated financial position results of operation or liquidity and defense costs may be material however at this time based on presently available information we view this possibility as remote

we have entered into a series of agreements with certain of our or our predecessors’ legacy insurers and certain potential indemnitors to secure insurance coverage andor reimbursement for the costs associated with the asbestos and silicarelated lawsuits filed against us we have also pursued litigation against certain insurers or indemnitors where necessary we have an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestos related recoveries of approximately 1030 million and 1004 million as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 which was included in “other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this form 10k during the year ended december 31 2018 we received asbestos related insurance recoveries of 144 million of which 62 million related to the recovery of indemnity payments and was recorded as a reduction of the insurance recovery receivable in “other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this form 10k and 82 million related to the reimbursement of previously expensed legal defense costs and was recorded as a reduction of “selling and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this form 10k

the largest such recent action gardner denver inc v certain underwriters at lloyd’s london et al was filed on july 9 2010 in the eighth judicial circuit adams county illinois as case number 10l48 the “adams county case” in the lawsuit we seek among other things to require certain excess insurer defendants to honor their insurance policy obligations to us including payment in whole or in part of the costs associated with the asbestosrelated lawsuits filed against us in october 2011 we reached a settlement with one of the insurer defendants which had issued both primary and excess policies for approximately the amount of such defendant’s policies which were subject to the lawsuit since then the case has been proceeding through the discovery and motions process with the remaining insurer defendants on january 29 2016 we prevailed on the first phase of that 

discovery and motions process “phase i” specifically the court in the adams county case ruled that we have rights under all of the policies in the case subject to their terms and conditions even though the policies were sold to our former owners rather than to us on june 9 2016 the court denied a motion by several of the insurers who sought permission to appeal the phase i ruling now rather than waiting until the end of the whole case as is normally required the case is now proceeding through the discovery and motions process regarding the remaining issues in dispute “phase ii”

a majority of our expected future recoveries of the costs associated with the asbestosrelated lawsuits are the subject of the adams county case

the amounts we recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurance recoveries are based on currently available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our evaluation of relevant factors with input from a third party actuarial expert our actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be higher or lower than those recorded if actual results vary significantly from the assumptions there are a number of key variables and assumptions including the number and type of new claims to be filed each year the resolution or outcome of these claims the average cost of resolution of each new claim the amount of insurance available allocation methodologies the contractual terms with each insurer with whom we have reached settlements the resolution of coverage issues with other excess insurance carriers with whom we have not yet achieved settlements and the solvency risk with respect to our insurance carriers other factors that may affect our future liability include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case legal rulings that may be made by state and federal courts and the passage of state or federal legislation we make the necessary adjustments for our asbestos liability and corresponding insurance recoveries on an annual basis unless facts or circumstances warrant assessment as of an interim date

environmental liabilities 

we have been identified as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites although these laws impose joint and several liability on prps in application the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp based on currently available information we are only a small contributor to these waste sites and we have or are attempting to negotiate de minimis settlements for our cleanup the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and our future obligations entail a share of the sites’ ongoing operating and maintenance expense we are also addressing four onsite cleanups for which we are the primary responsible party three of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and one is in the implementation stage

we have an accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet of 69 million and 75 million as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for our remaining financial obligations for the environmental matters discussed above and which does not anticipate that any of these matters will result in material additional costs beyond amounts accrued based upon consideration of currently available information we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal state local or foreign environmental laws or regulations or cleanup costs relating to these matters

components of our revenue and expenses 

revenues 

we generate revenue from sales of our highly engineered applicationcritical products and by providing associated aftermarket parts consumables and services we sell our products and deliver aftermarket services both directly to endusers and through independent distribution channels depending on the product line and geography below is a description of our revenues by segment and factors impacting total revenues

industrials revenue 

our industrials segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of air compression vacuum and blower products to customers in multiple industries and geographies a significant portion of our sales in the industrials segment are made to independent distributors the majority of industrials segment revenues are derived from short duration contracts and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered certain contracts may involve significant design engineering to customer specifications and depending on the contractual terms revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when equipment is delivered to the customer our large installed base of products in our industrials segment drives demand for recurring aftermarket support services primarily composed of replacement part sales to our distribution partners and to a lesser extent by directly providing replacement parts and repair and maintenance services to end customers revenue for services is recognized when services are performed 

energy revenue 

our energy segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems and engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for use primarily in upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical endmarkets across multiple geographies the majority of energy segment revenues are derived from short duration contracts and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered certain contracts with 

customers in the mid and downstream and petrochemical markets are higher sales value and often have longer lead times and involve more application specific engineering depending on the contractual terms revenue is recognized either over the duration of the contract or at contract completion when equipment is delivered to the customer provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable as a result the timing of these contracts can result in significant variation in reported revenue from quarter to quarter our large installed base of products in our energy segment drives demand for recurring aftermarket support services to customers including replacement parts consumables and repair and maintenance services the mix of aftermarket to original equipment revenue within the energy segment is impacted by trends in upstream energy activity in north america revenue for services is recognized when services are performed in response to customer demand for faster access to aftermarket parts and repair services we expanded our direct aftermarket service locations in our energy segment particularly in north american markets driven by upstream energy activity energy segment products and aftermarket parts consumables and services are sold both directly to end customers and through independent distributors depending on the product category and geography

medical revenue 

our medical segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of highly specialized gas liquid and precision syringe pumps that are specified by medical and laboratory equipment suppliers for use in medical and laboratory applications our products are often subject to extensive collaborative design and specification requirements as they are generally components specifically designed for and integrated into our customers’ products revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer generally at shipment or when delivery has occurred our medical segment also has limited aftermarket revenues related to certain products

expenses 

cost of sales 

cost of sales includes the costs we incur including purchased materials labor and overhead related to manufactured products and aftermarket parts sold during a period depreciation related to manufacturing equipment and facilities is included in cost of sales purchased materials represent the majority of costs of sales with steel aluminum copper and partially finished castings representing our most significant materials inputs we have instituted a global sourcing strategy to take advantage of coordinated purchasing opportunities of key materials across our manufacturing plant locations

cost of sales for services includes the direct costs we incur including direct labor parts and other overhead costs including depreciation of equipment and facilities to deliver repair maintenance and other field services to our customers

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses consist of i salaries and other employeerelated expenses for our selling and administrative functions and other activities not associated with the manufacture of products or delivery of services to customers ii facility operating expenses for selling and administrative activities including office rent maintenance depreciation and insurance iii marketing and direct costs of selling products and services to customers including internal and external sales commissions iv research and development expenditures v professional and consultant fees vi kkr fees and expenses vii expenses related to our public stock offerings and to establish public company reporting compliance and viii other miscellaneous expenses certain corporate expenses including those related to our shared service centers in the united states and europe that directly benefit our businesses are allocated to our business segments certain corporate administrative expenses including corporate executive compensation treasury certain information technology internal audit and tax compliance are not allocated to the business segments

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets includes the periodic amortization of intangible assets recognized when an affiliate of kkr acquired us on july 30 2013 and intangible assets recognized in connection with businesses we acquired since july 30 2013 including customer relationships and trademarks

impairment of other intangible assets 

impairment of other intangible assets includes noncash charges we recognized for the impairment of other intangible assets

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net includes foreign currency gains and losses restructuring charges certain litigation and contract settlement losses environmental remediation stockbased compensation expense and other miscellaneous operating expenses

provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision or benefit for income taxes includes us federal state and local income taxes and all nonus income taxes we are subject to income tax in approximately 35 jurisdictions outside of the united states because we conduct operations on a global basis our effective tax rate depends and will continue to depend on the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions the availability of tax credits and nondeductible items

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 and 2018 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and 3 a change in us deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to the us tax rate reduction from 35 to 21 see note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

items affecting our reported results 

general economic conditions and capital spending in the industries we serve 

our financial results closely follow changes in the industries and endmarkets we serve demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures depends in turn on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost in particular demand for our industrials products generally correlates with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production capacity utilization rates above 80 have historically indicated a strong demand environment for industrial equipment in our energy segment demand for our products that serve upstream energy endmarkets are influenced heavily by energy prices and the expectation as to future trends in those prices energy prices have historically been cyclical in nature and are affected by a wide range of factors in addition to energy prices demand for our upstream energy products are positively impacted by increasing global land rig count drilled but uncompleted wells the level of hydraulic fracturing intensity and activity measured by horsepower utilization and lateral lengths as well as drilling and completion capital expenditures in the midstream and downstream portions of our energy segment overall economic growth and industrial production as well as secular trends impact demand for our products in our medical segment we expect demand for our products to be driven by favorable trends including the growth in healthcare spend and expansion of healthcare systems due to an aging population requiring medical care and increased investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures in emerging economies over longer time periods we believe that demand for all of our products also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gdp around the world as augmented by secular trends in each segment our ability to grow and our financial performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations including efficiently utilizing our global sales manufacturing and distribution capabilities and engineering innovative new product applications for endusers in a variety of geographic markets

foreign currency fluctuations 

a significant portion of our revenues approximately 52 for the year ended december 31 2018 was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the united states a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion

factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations 

as a result of a number of factors our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below

variability within upstream energy markets 

we sell products and provide services to customers in upstream energy markets primarily in the united states for the upstream energy endmarket in our energy segment we manufacture pumps and associated aftermarket products and services used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well service applications while in our industrials segment we sell dry bulk frac sand blowers which are used in hydraulic fracturing operations we refer to these products and services in the energy and industrial segments as “upstream energy” our medical segment is not exposed to the upstream energy industry

demand for upstream energy products has historically corresponded to the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and has been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity rig count drilling activity and other economic factors these factors have caused the level of demand for certain of our energy products to change at times both positively and negatively and we expect these trends to continue in the future

we believe it is helpful to consider the impact of our exposure to upstream energy in evaluating our 2016 2017 and 2018 segment revenue and segment adjusted ebitda in order to better understand other drivers of our performance during those periods including operational improvements for the energy segment we assess the impact of our exposure to upstream energy as the portion of energy segment adjusted ebitda of the business unit serving the upstream energy market for the industrials segment we assess the impact as the standard profit on the specific upstream energy market products

restructuring and other business transformation initiatives 

since 2013 our top priority has been to implement business transformation initiatives a key element of those business transformation initiatives was restructuring programs within our industrials energy and medical segments as well as at the corporate level restructuring charges program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly under these restructuring programs we incurred restructuring charges of 53 million and 329 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively in addition we incurred program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs of 53 million and 87 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively we also made capital expenditures related to these programs of approximately 31 million in 2017 and 162 million in 2016 the industrials restructuring program included the closure of a business that had approximately 30 million in revenues in 2016 these restructuring programs were completed in 2017 we generally expect that the savings associated with these restructuring programs will recover the associated costs within two to three years of such costs being incurred

we announced a restructuring program in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 that primarily involves workforce reductions and facility consolidations in the year ended december 31 2018 127 million was charged to expense related to this restructuring program we expect additional restructuring activity in the first half of 2019 focused on targeted workforce optimization within general and administrative backoffice and manufacturing overhead as well as continued facility consolidation

acquisitions 

given our global reach market leading position in our various product categories strong channel access and aftermarket presence and operational excellence competency our company provides an attractive acquisition platform in the flow control and compression equipment sectors part of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary flow control and compression equipment businesses which provide access to new technologies or geographies or improve our aftermarket offerings

in august 2016 we acquired a manufacturer of highly specialized consumable microsyringes and valves that are used in liquid handling instruments in our medical segment for approximately 188 million 

in june 2017 within our industrials segment we acquired a leading north american manufacturer of gas compression equipment and solutions for vapor recovery biogas and other process and industrial applications for approximately 204 million net of cash acquired inclusive of an indemnity holdback of 19 million recorded in “accrued liabilities” 

in february 2018 we acquired a leading global manufacturer of turbo vacuum technology systems and optimization solutions for industrial applications in our industrials segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of 

approximately 949 million in may 2018 we acquired a leading manufacturer of plungers and other well service pump consumable products in our energy segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of approximately 210 million inclusive of cash payments of 188 million a 20 million promissory note and a 02 million holdback in november 2018 we acquired a leading manufacturer of rotary screws and piston compressors and associated aftermarket parts in our industrials segment for total consideration net of cash acquired of 161 million inclusive of cash payments of 148 million and a 13 million holdback in december 2018 we acquired a leading manufacturer of specialty industrial pumps and associated aftermarket parts in our industrials segment for total consideration of 585 million net of cash acquired inclusive of cash payments of 578 million a payable for a 01 million purchase price adjustment and a 06 million holdback

the revenues for these acquisitions subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition included in our financial results were 1080 million 278 million and 49 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the operating income loss for these acquisitions subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition including organic growth since acquisition included in our financial results was 88 million 37 million and 03 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

see note 3 “business combinations” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion around the outstanding holdbacks for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

kkr management fees and expenses 

through the date of our initial public offering in 2017 kkr charged an annual management fee as well as fees and expenses for services provided these fees and charges were 11 million and 48 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively in may 2017 the monitoring agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms and we paid an additional termination fee of approximately 162 million 

stockbased compensation expense 

for the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred stockbased compensation expense of approximately 28 million which was reduced by 51 million primarily due to a decrease in the estimated accrual for employer taxes related to dsus as a result of a lower per share stock price 

the 28 million of stockbased compensation expense included expense for the modification of equity awards for certain former employees of 38 million and expense for equity awards granted under the 2013 plan and the 2017 plan of 72 million reduced by a benefit for a reduction in the liability for stock appreciation rights “sar” of 82 million as of december 31 2018 there was 203 million of unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to outstanding stock options that will be recognized in future periods 

subsequent to the initial public offering in may 2017 we recognized stockbased compensation expense of approximately 776 million related to timebased and performancebased stock options as of december 31 2017 there was 91 million of unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to outstanding stock options that will be recognized in future periods the company also recognized 974 million of compensation expense related to a grant of 55 million dsus to employees at the date of the initial public offering and employer taxes related to dsus of 192 million the company expects to make stockbased awards to employees and recognize stockbased compensation expenses in future periods

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes including the determination of the transition tax the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the reassessment of the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act in our financial statements for 2017 and through the first nine months of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our 

accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act by increasing the total benefit taken in 2017 of 953 million to 965 million due to the tax act the total us deferred changed from a tax benefit of 896 million in 2017 to 745 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 151 million and the asc 74030 formerly apb 23 liability related to the permanent reinvestment of earnings in foreign subsidiaries assertion changed from a tax benefit of 690 million in 2017 to 725 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 35 million the provisional onetime transition tax of 633 million in 2017 decreased to 505 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 128 million the total 12 million benefit has a 03 impact to the overall rate in 2018

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfc” must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income

under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company has determined that it will follow the period cost method option 1 above going forward the tax provision for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 reflects this decision all of the additional calculations and rule changes found in the tax act have been considered in the tax provision for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 the company recorded a tax expense of 119 million in the period for the gilti provisions of the tax act that were effective for the first time during 2018

see note 15 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

outlook 

industrials segment 

the missioncritical nature of our industrials products across manufacturing processes drives a demand environment and outlook that are correlated with global and regional industrial production capacity utilization and longterm gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had 3225 million of orders in our industrials segment an increase of 1 over the fourth quarter of 2017 or a 4 increase on a constant currency basis we believe that we are well positioned to continue to benefit from a slower but positive industrial production and global gdp outlook our fourth quarter of 2018 constant currency increase was on top of strong fourth quarter of 2017 growth of 25

energy segment 

our energy segment has a diverse range of equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for a number of market sectors with both energy exposure spanning upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical applications 

our upstream products demand environment and outlook are influenced heavily by the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and has been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity global land rig count drilled but uncompleted wells and other economic factors these factors have caused the level of demand for certain of our upstream products to change at times both positively and negatively and we expect these trends to continue in the future we believe we are well positioned to continue to benefit given our market position diverse range of equipment aftermarket parts and consumables and our service presence but expect the demand environment and economic factors growth will slow with some factors potentially declining 

our midstream and downstream products demand environment and outlook are relatively stable with attractive longterm growth trends influenced by longterm gdp growth and the continued increase in the production and transportation of hydrocarbon demand for our petrochemical industry products correlates with capital expenditures related to growth and maintenance of petrochemical plants as well as activity levels therein advancements in the development of unconventional natural gas resources in north america over the past decade have resulted in the abundant availability of locallysourced natural gas as feedstock for petrochemical plants in north america supporting longterm growth

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had 2695 million of orders in our energy segment a decrease of 4 over the fourth quarter of 2017 or a 3 decrease on a constant currency basis this fourth quarter of 2018 constant currency decrease was off strong fourth quarter of 2017 growth of 62

medical segment 

during 2018 we focused on the development and introduction of new products and applications to access the liquid pump market leveraging our technology and expertise in gas pumps entering 2019 we believe that demand for products and services in the medical space will continue to benefit from attractive secular growth trends in the aging population requiring medical care emerging economies modernizing and expanding their healthcare systems and increased investment globally in health solutions in addition we expect growing demand for higher healthcare efficiency requiring premium and high performance systems in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had 658 million of orders in our medical segment a decrease of 1 over 2017 or a 1 increase on a constant currency basis this fourth quarter increase on a constant currency basis was on top of strong fourth quarter of 2017 growth of 29 

how we assess the performance of our business 

we manage operations through the three business segments described above in addition to our consolidated gaap financial measures we review various nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow

we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain noncash nonrecurring and other adjustment items we believe that the adjustments applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material noncash items and about nonrecurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future adjusted net income is defined as net income loss including interest depreciation and amortization of nonacquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate adjusted ebitda and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions

we use free cash flow to review the liquidity of our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt free cash flow is not a measure of our liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities

management and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation such measures are provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures under gaap in addition we believe that adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers many of which also present adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity

adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under gaap

included in our discussion of our consolidated and segment results below are changes in revenues and adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda as total revenues and adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the constant currency revenue and adjusted ebitda growth on a yearoveryear basis constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period revenues and adjusted 

ebitda using corresponding prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

for further information regarding these measures see “item 6 selected financial data” 

results of operations 

consolidated results should be read in conjunction with segment results and the segment information notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of our consolidated statements of operations all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated within the consolidated results

consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

 

 

revenues 

revenues for 2018 were 26898 million an increase of 3144 million or 132 compared to 23754 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was due primarily to higher revenues from upstream energy exposed markets 38 or 902 million higher volume in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments including from acquisitions 70 or 1671 million improved pricing in the other markets of our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments 12 or 288 million and the favorable impact of foreign currencies 12 or 283 million the percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 392 in 2018 compared to 413 in 2017

revenues for 2017 were 23754 million an increase of 4360 million or 225 compared to 19394 million in 2016 the increase in revenues was due primarily to higher revenues from upstream energy exposed markets 209 or 4055 million the favorable impact of foreign currencies 11 or 218 million improved pricing in the other markets of our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments 10 or 188 million and higher volume in our industrials segment including from acquisitions net of divestitures 01 or 16 million partially offset by lower volume including acquisitions in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our medical segment 06 or 117 million the percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 413 in 2017 compared to 347 in 2016

see further analysis in the segment results below

selling and administrative expenses were 4346 million in 2018 a decrease of 116 million or 26 compared to 4462 million in 2017 selling and administrative expenses includes kkr fees and expenses of 00 million in 2018 and 173 million in 2017 and expenses related to our public stock offerings and establishment of public company financial reporting of 72 million in 2018 and 122 million in 2017 excluding these items selling and administrative expenses were 4274 million in 2018 compared to 4167 million in 2017 and selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 159 in 2018 from 175 in 2017 this increase in selling and administrative expense in 2018 primarily reflects increased professional and consulting fees increased salaries and additional selling and administrative expenses from acquisitions partially offset by decreased incentive compensations selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to higher revenues 

selling and administrative expenses were 4462 million in 2017 an increase of 311 million or 75 compared to 4151 million in 2016 selling and administrative expenses in 2017 includes 122 million of expenses related to our public stock offerings and establishment of public company financial reporting and 173 million of kkr fees and expenses compared to 02 million and 48 million of expenses related to the establishment of public company financial reporting and kkr fees and expenses in 2016 respectively excluding these items selling and administrative expenses were 4167 million in 2017 compared to 4101 million in 2016 and selling and 

administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 175 in 2017 from 211 in 2016 this increase in selling and administrative expense in 2017 primarily reflects increased salaries and other employee related expenses and professional and consulting fees partially offset by reduced facilities operating expenses and reduced sales commissions selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to higher revenues 

amortization of intangible assets 

amortization of intangible assets was 1258 million 1189 million and 1242 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase of 69 million in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles acquired in 2018 

the decrease of 53 million in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to assets that became fully amortized in 2016 partially offset by changes in foreign currencies

in 2016 we recorded a noncash charge for the impairment of other intangible assets of 253 million primarily related to trademarks in our industrials segment

other operating expense net 

other operating expense net was 91 million in 2018 a decrease of 2130 million compared to 2221 million in 2017 primarily due to lower stockbased compensation expense of 1723 million and lower employer taxes related to stockbased compensation of 243 million foreign currency transaction gains of 19 million in 2018 compared to losses of 93 million in 2017 and shareholder litigation settlement recoveries in 2018 of 95 million partially offset by increased restructuring charges of 74 million and increased acquisition related expenses and noncash charges of 64 million

other operating expense net was 2221 million in 2017 an increase of 1735 million compared to 486 million in 2016 primarily due to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense for stock options and deferred stock units of 1750 million employer taxes related to deferred stock units of 192 million and increased foreign currency transaction losses of 93 million in 2017 compared to gains of 59 million in 2016 partially offset by lower employee severance costs of 53 million in 2017 compared to 329 million in 2016 and lower environmental remediation of 09 million in 2017 compared to 56 million in 2016

other income net was 72 million 34 million and 36 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in other income net of 38 million in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a reduction of 51 million in the other components of net periodic benefit cost increased interest income of 08 million and increased other financing income of 07 million partially offset by a decrease in the gains on postretirement plan investments of 28 million the decrease of 02 million in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase of 12 million in the other components of net periodic benefit cost partially offset by the increase in the gain on postretirement plan investments of 10 million

provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 801 million resulting in a 229 effective tax rate in 2018 compared to a benefit of 1312 million resulting in a 1163 effective tax benefit rate in 2017 the increase in the tax provision

the benefit for income taxes was 1312 million resulting in a 1163 effective tax benefit rate in 2017 compared to a benefit of 319 million resulting in a 505 effective tax benefit rate in 2016 the increase in the tax benefit and the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the tax act there was a 896 million deferred benefit associated with the rate moving from 35 to 21 in 2017 we recognized an asc 74030 formerly apb 23 liability reduction related to the permanent reinvestment of earnings in foreign subsidiaries assertion resulting in a benefit of 690 million which was partially offset by a onetime transition tax provision of approximately 633 million

net income loss 

net income was 2694 million in 2018 compared to a net income of 185 million in 2017 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating income on higher revenues and gross profit lower stockbased compensation expense lower loss on extinguishment of debt and lower interest expense partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes

net income was 185 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of 313 million in 2016 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating income on higher revenues and gross profit and lower interest expense and an increase in the benefit for income taxes partially offset by higher stockbased compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt

segment results 

we classify our businesses into three segments industrials energy and medical our corporate operations as described below are not discussed separately as any results that had a significant impact on operating results are included in the consolidated results discussion above

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability our management closely monitors segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate past performance and identify actions required to improve profitability

the segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are described in note 21 “segment information” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

included in our discussion of our segment results below are changes in segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency as changes in segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements we use these measures to determine the constant currency segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda growth on a yearonyear basis constant currency segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda using prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources 

our investment resources include cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement 

for a description of our material indebtedness see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

as of december 31 2018 we had 65 million of outstanding letters of credit written against the revolving credit facility and 2634 million of unused availability we also had 268 million of letters of credit outstanding against the receivables financing agreement and 833 million unused availability

as of december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing

liquidity 

a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements and from the ongoing cost of operations working capital and capital expenditures

 

we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 2500 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we can incur additional secured indebtedness under the term loan facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

our principal sources of liquidity have been existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities and the receivables financing agreement our principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital meet debt service requirements fund capital expenditures and finance strategic plans including possible acquisitions we may also seek to finance capital expenditures under capital leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms we continue to consider acquisition opportunities but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings as market conditions warrant we may from time to time seek to repay loans that we have borrowed including the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities based on our current level of operations and available cash we believe our cash flow from operations together with availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our revolving credit facility or the receivables financing agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs our ability to do so depends on among other factors prevailing economic conditions many of which are beyond our control in addition upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in control we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness including the senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

the majority of our cash is in jurisdictions outside of the united states as a result of the kkr transaction and the significant increase in our longterm debt balance as of july 30 2013 the kkr transaction date we modified our assertion concerning the permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries we asserted that we intended to repatriate approximately 2000 million of accumulated earnings for the purpose of servicing our senior secured credit facilities which would have resulted in net united states tax liabilities as these foreign earnings were distributed due to the tax act we decided to reverse our asc 74030 formerly apb 23 position effective the fourth quarter of 2018 we no longer assert the indefinite reinvestment of our historical nonus earnings or future nonus earnings the company adjusted its asc 74030 deferred foreign tax liability to cover all estimated withholding state income tax and foreign income tax associated with repatriating all nonus earnings as of december 31 2018 back to the united states our deferred income tax liability as of december 31 2018 is 56 million which consists mainly of withholding taxes as a result of the significant reduction in distributable profits due to restructuring and repatriation and the change in assertion a 35 million tax benefit was created in 2018 

working capital 

 

net working capital decreased 1670 million to 7348 million as of december 31 2018 from 9018 million as of december 31 2017 operating working capital decreased 589 million to 6461 million as of december 31 2018 from 7050 million as of december 31 2017 operating working capital as of december 31 2018 was 240 of 2018 revenues as compared to 297 as of december 31 2017 as a percentage of 2017 revenues the decrease in operating working capital was due to higher accounts payable and higher contract liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable and contract assets and higher inventories during 2018 management proactively focused on improving net working capital performance through centralized process improvement initiatives excluding 2018 acquisitions and the impact of foreign currencies despite higher revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and delays in the timing of collections from certain upstream energy customers accounts receivable decreased modestly resulting from the enhanced receivables collection efforts the increase in contract assets resulted from the adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 “asc 606” in the first quarter of 2018 excluding 2018 acquisitions and the impact of foreign currencies inventories as of december 31 2018 were essentially flat compared to the prior year due to improved management of production inventory levels at certain key manufacturing facilities offset by higher than expected inventory levels in our upstream energy business resulting primarily from reduced demand in the fourth quarter of 2018 accounts payable increased significantly as of december 31 2018 as compared to december 31 2017 due to continuing efforts to standardize and extend vendor payment terms and pay practices the increase in contract liabilities was primarily due to an acquisition in 2018 and the timing of progress collections on certain long term contracts

net working capital increased 2112 million to 9018 million as of december 31 2017 from 6906 million as of december 31 2016 operating working capital increased 933 million to 7050 million as of december 31 2017 from 6117 million as of december 31 2016 operating working capital at december 31 2017 as a percentage of 2017 revenues was 297 as compared to 315 at december 31 2016 as a percentage of 2016 revenues this increase was primarily due to higher accounts receivable higher inventories and lower contract liabilities partially offset by higher accounts payable the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a higher level of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the recovery in the upstream energy markets the increase in accounts receivable was also due to a difference in sales mix between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2017 a higher portion of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to highly engineered solution product contracts with higher advance payments ahead of revenue recognition than in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase in inventories was primarily due to additions to inventories in anticipation of increased demand for certain products primarily in the energy segment evidenced by increased orders in the energy segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase in accounts payable was due to increased levels of inventories and continuing efforts to standardize vendor payment terms and pay practices contract liabilities were essentially flat as of december 31 2017 in comparison to 2016

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our future minimum payments as of december 31 2018 for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to the year ended december 31 2018

 

 

 

total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 were 969 million the total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet line items “accrued liabilities” and “pensions and other postretirement benefits” because these liabilities are impacted by among other items plan funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets these liabilities do not represent expected liquidity needs accordingly we did not include these liabilities in the “contractual obligations” table above

we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction we are committed to making the required minimum contributions and expect to contribute a total of approximately 01 million to our us qualified pension plans during 2019 furthermore we expect to contribute a total of approximately 03 million to our postretirement life insurance benefit plans during 2019 future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets benefit payment experience and changes if any to current funding requirements therefore no amounts were included in the “contractual obligations” table related to expected plan contributions we generally expect to fund all future contributions to our plans with cash flows from operating activities

our nonus pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we expect to contribute a total of approximately 47 million to our nonus qualified pension plans during 2019 no amounts have been included in the “contractual obligations” table related to these plans due to the same reasons indicated above

disclosure of amounts in the “contractual obligations” table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans we currently anticipate the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately 45 million to 55 million for the next several years and the annual benefit payments for the nonus plans to be in the range of approximately 100 million to 120 million for the next several years

contingencies 

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to include a total litigation reserve of 1058 million as of december 31 2018 with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation other than our asbestosrelated litigation reserves we only have de minimis accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to other legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth in “item 3 legal proceedings”

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties certain of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increase in tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of october 1 of that year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable upon adoption of asu 201804 the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value provided the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if applicable we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiples approaches which are weighted 75 and 25 respectively

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2018 reporting unit valuations ranged from 103 to 115 additionally we assumed 30 terminal growth rates for all reporting units

under the market multiples approach fair value is determined based on multiples derived from the stock prices of publically traded guideline companies to develop a business enterprise value “bev” for our reporting units the 

application of the market multiples method entails the development of book value multiples based on the market value of the guideline companies the multiples are developed by first calculating the market value of equity of the guideline companies and then adjusting these multiples for cash and debt to arrive at a bev multiple identifying appropriate guideline companies and computing appropriate market multiples is subjective we considered various public companies that had reasonably similar qualitative factors as our reporting units while also considering quantitative factors such as revenue growth profitability and total assets

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 922 with each reporting unit’s fair value in excess of its carrying value no goodwill impairment was recorded 

we annually test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation referred to as the relief from royalty method we estimated forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 113 to 125 a terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 40

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset

income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes including the determination of the transition tax the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the reassessment of the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act in our financial statements for 2017 and through the first nine month period of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the tax act by increasing the total benefit taken in 2017 of 953 million to 965 million the total us deferred change due to the tax act went from a tax benefit of 896 million in 2017 to 745 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 151 million the asc 74030 formerly apb 23 liability related to the permanent reinvestment of earnings in foreign subsidiaries assertion changed from a tax benefit of 690 million in 2017 to 725 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 35 million resulting from a reduction in distributable profits due to restructuring and repatriations and the change in policy that occurred in 2018 the provisional onetime transition tax of 633 million in 2017 decreased to 505 million in 2018 with a 2018 measurementperiod adjustment of 128 million the total 12 million benefit has a 03 impact to the overall rate in 2018

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by cfcs must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income

under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” we determined that we will follow the period cost method option 1 above going forward the tax provision for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 reflects this decision all of the additional calculations and rule changes found in the tax act have been considered in the tax provision for year and quarter ended december 31 2018 the company recorded a tax expense of 119 million in the period for the gilti provisions of the tax act that were effective for the first time during 2018

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all stockbased payments to employees and nonemployees including grants of stock options and deferred stock units “dsu” to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards 

the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the blackscholesmerton valuation model the model requires certain assumptions including the estimated expected term of the stock options the riskfree interest rate and the assumed volatility of which certain assumptions are highly complex and subjective the expected option life represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding based on managements best estimate of the timing of a liquidity event and the contractual term of the stock option as there is not sufficient trading history of our common stock we use a group of our competitors which we believe are similar to us adjusted for our capital structure in order to estimate volatility our exercise price is the stock price on the date in which shares were granted 

concurrent with the company’s initial public offering in may of 2017 the company’s board authorized the grant of 55 million dsus to all permanent employees that had not previously received stockbased awards under the 2013 plan the dsus vested immediately upon grant however contain restrictions such that the employee may not sell or otherwise realize the economic benefits of the award until certain dates through april 2019 the fair value of each dsu grant under the stockbased compensation plan is estimated on the date of grant or modification using the finnerty discount for lack of marketability pricing model the discount for lack of marketability is commensurate with the period of sale restrictions related to the company’s initial public offering 

prior to our initial public offering our stock price was calculated based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method forecasted cash flows are discounted to the present value at a riskadjusted discount rate the valuation analyses determine discrete free cash flows over several years based on forecast financial information provided by management and a terminal value for the residual period beyond the discrete forecast which are discounted at an appropriate rate to estimate our enterprise value under the market approach specifically the guideline public company method we select publicly traded companies with similar financial and operating characteristics as us and calculate valuation multiples based on the guideline public company’s financial information and market data subsequent to the initial public offering the estimation of our stock price is no longer necessary as we rely on the market price to determine the market value of our common stock for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 16 “stockbased compensation plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

loss contingencies 

loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to asbestos and silica related litigation environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine 

both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variablerate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable debt and from time to time use payfixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative fixed and variable portions

as of december 31 2018 we had variable rate debt outstanding net of our interest rate swaps of 7241 million at a current weighted average interest rate of 31 substantially all of which was incurred under our 22806 million senior secured credit facility under which 9526 million was outstanding under the 12855 million dollar term loan facility and €6073 million was outstanding under the €6150 million euro term loan facility 

the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility bear interest primarily based on libor and euribor respectively plus a spread the dollar term loan facility is subject to a 0 libor base rate floor and the euro term loan facility is subject to a 0 euribor base rate floor thus the interest rate on the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility will fluctuate when libor or euribor respectively exceeds that percentage as of december 31 2018 libor was higher than the 0 floor and euribor was lower than the 0 floor

we use interest rate swaps to offset our exposure to interest rate movements these outstanding interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted liborbased interest payments as of december 31 2018 we were a fixed rate payer on eight fixedfloating interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the liborbased index used to determine the interest rates charged on our liborbased variable rate borrowings see note 17 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the following table presents the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the yield curve by 100 basis points including the effect of our interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 on our interest expense

 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our global business operations changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency in 2018 the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2017 the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies

we seek to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risks through a combination of normal operating activities including by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies to match expenses with revenues and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and net investment crosscurrency interest rate swaps in addition to mitigate the risk arising from entering into transactions in currencies other than our functional currencies we typically settle intercompany trading balances monthly

the table below presents the percentage of revenues and gross profit by principal currency for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017

 

we utilize foreign currency denominated debt obligations supplemented from time to time with cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of the designated debt obligations and cross currency interest rate swaps are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income within our stockholders’ equity where they partially offset the currency translation effects of our investments in nonus subsidiaries which in turn partially offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally these currency translation effects and offsetting impacts of our derivatives for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 are summarized in note 13 “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk arising from transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries our foreign currency forward contracts are typically shortterm and are rolled forward as necessary upon settlement as of december 31 2018 we were party to seven foreign currency forward contracts all of which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value see note 17 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

our company

we are a leading global provider of missioncritical flow control and compression equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services which we sell across multiple attractive endmarkets within the industrial energy and medical industries we manufacture one of the broadest and most complete ranges of compressor pump vacuum and blower products in our markets which combined with our global geographic footprint and application expertise allows us to provide differentiated product and service offerings to our customers our products are sold under a collection of premier marketleading brands including gardner denver compair nash emco wheaton robuschi elmo rietschle and thomas which we believe are globally recognized in their respective endmarkets and known for product quality reliability efficiency and superior customer service these attributes along with over 155 years of engineering heritage generate strong brand loyalty for our products and foster longstanding customer relationships which we believe have resulted in leading market positions within each of our operating segments we have sales in more than 175 countries and our diverse customer base utilizes our products across a wide array of endmarkets that have favorable near and longterm growth prospects including industrial manufacturing energy with particular exposure to the north american upstream landbased market transportation medical and laboratory sciences food and beverage packaging and chemical processing

our products and services are critical to the processes and systems in which they are utilized which are often complex and function in harsh conditions where the cost of failure or downtime is high however our products typically represent only a small portion of the costs of the overall systems or functions that they support as a result our customers place a high value on our application expertise product reliability and the responsiveness of our service to support our customers and market presence we maintain significant global scale with 38 key manufacturing facilities more than 30 complementary service and repair centers across six continents and approximately 6400 employees worldwide as of december 31 2017

 

the processcritical nature of our product applications coupled with the standard wear and tear replacement cycles associated with the usage of our products generates opportunities to support customers with our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts consumables and services customers place a high value on minimizing any time their operations are offline as a result the availability of replacement parts consumables and our repair and support services are key components of our value proposition our large installed base of products provides a recurring revenue stream through our aftermarket parts consumables and services offerings as a result our aftermarket revenue is significant representing 41 of total company revenue and approximately 45 of our combined industrials and energy segments’ revenue in 2017

we were acquired by an affiliate of kkr on july 30 2013 the “kkr transaction” and have undergone a significant transformation since that date from 2014 to 2016 our transformation significantly improved our underlying operating performance our senior leadership team led by our ceo vicente reynal has been reconstituted and expanded which we believe brought together deep expertise from leading global industrial organizations in addition 45 of our top 100 business managers including the senior management team have joined since the kkr transaction which we believe added significant new levels of talent to our leadership team as part of our transformation we also reorganized our company into three business segments because of the sales drivers and market characteristics of each together our industrials energy and medical segments create a diverse portfolio with exposure to highly attractive endmarkets significant aftermarket revenues upside from an upstream energy recovery and positive secular trends across all segments

our segments

our business is comprised of three strategic segments

industrials

we design manufacture market and service a broad range of air compression vacuum and blower products including associated aftermarket parts consumables and services across a wide array of technologies and applications for use in diverse endmarkets compressors are used to increase the pressure of air or gas vacuum products are used to remove air or gas in order to reduce the pressure below atmospheric levels and blower products are used to produce a high volume of air or gas at low pressure almost every manufacturing and industrial facility and many service and process industry applications use air compression vacuum and blower products in a variety of processcritical applications such as the operation of industrial air tools vacuum packaging of food products and aeration of waste water among others

we offer one of the broadest portfolios of compression vacuum and blower technology in our markets which we believe alongside our geographic footprint allows us to provide differentiated service to our customers globally and maintain leading positions in many of our endmarkets our compression products cover the full range of technologies including rotary screw reciprocating piston scroll rotary vane and centrifugal compressors our vacuum products and blowers also cover the full technology spectrum vacuum technologies include side channel liquid ring claw vacuum screw and rotary vane vacuum pumps among others while blower technologies include rotary lobe blowers screw claw and vane turbo side channel and radial blowers we believe our ability to support custom industrial application needs from nearly full vacuum to approximately 7000 pounds per square inch psi pressure levels makes us a partner of choice for many of our longstanding customers the breadth and depth of our product offering creates incremental business opportunities by allowing us to crosssell our full product portfolio and uniquely address customers’ needs in one complete solution

we sell our industrial products through an integrated network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors which is strategically tailored to meet the dynamics of each target geography or endmarket our large installed base also provides for a significant stream of recurring aftermarket revenue for example on average the useful life of a compressor is between 10 and 12 years however a customer typically services the compressor at regular intervals starting within the first two years of purchase and continuing throughout the life of the product the cumulative aftermarket revenue generated by a compressor over the product’s life cycle will typically exceed its original cost

industrial air compressors represent the largest market in which we compete in our industrials segment and is a product category for which we believe there is significant potential to drive increased sales of our aftermarket parts consumables and services we use our direct salesforce and strong distributor relationships the majority of which are exclusive to our business for the products that we sell through them to sell our broad portfolio of aftermarket parts consumables and services within our industrials segment we primarily sell through the gardner denver compair elmo rietschle and robuschi brands as well as other leading brand names

energy

we design manufacture market and service a diverse range of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services the highly engineered products offered by our energy segment serve customers across upstream midstream and downstream energy markets as well as petrochemical processing transportation and general industrial sectors we are one of the largest suppliers of equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for the energy market applications that we serve

 

our positive displacement pumps are fitforpurpose to meet the demands and challenges of modern unconventional drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity particularly in the major basins and shale plays in the north american land market our positive displacement pump offering includes missioncritical oil and gas drilling pumps frac pumps and well servicing pumps in addition to sales of associated consumables used in the operation of our pumps and aftermarket parts consumables and services the products we sell into upstream energy applications are highly aftermarketintensive and so we support these products in the field with one of the industry’s most comprehensive service networks which encompasses locations across all major basins and shale plays in the north american land market this north american landbased service network is critical to serving our customers and by supporting them in the field to generating demand for new original equipment sales for example fluid ends are key aftermarket parts used in hydraulic fracturing operations that represent approximately 30 of the original cost of the pump and need to be replaced approximately four times per year on each operating pump depending on the basin and operating nature of the hydraulic fracturing fleet other aftermarket parts such as plungers and consumables such as valves seats and packing are replaced on even shorter time frames creating aftermarket opportunities which in aggregate are often multiples of the cost of the original pump

our liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors are highly engineered products specifically designed for continuous duty in harsh environments to serve a wide range of applications including oil and gas refining and processing mining chemical processing petrochemical and industrial applications our liquid ring technology utilizes a service liquid to evacuate or compress gas by forming a rotating ring of liquid that acts like a piston to deliver an uninterrupted flow of gas without pulsation in addition our engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and systems ensure the safe and efficient transportation and transfer of petroleum products as well as certain other liquid commodity products to serve a wide range of industries similar to our positive displacement pumps business we complement these products with a broad array of aftermarket parts service and repair capabilities by leveraging our global network of manufacturing and service locations to meet the diverse needs of our customers within our energy segment we primarily sell through the gardner denver nash and emco wheaton brands as well as other leading brand names

medical

we design manufacture and market a broad range of highly specialized gas liquid and precision syringe pumps and compressors that are specified by medical and laboratory equipment suppliers and integrated into their final equipment for use in applications such as oxygen therapy blood dialysis patient monitoring laboratory sterilization and wound treatment among others we offer a comprehensive product portfolio across a breadth of technologies to address the medical and laboratory sciences pump and fluid handling industry as well as a range of enduse vacuum products for laboratory science applications and we recently expanded into liquid pumps and automated liquid handling components and systems our product performance quality and longterm reliability are often missioncritical in healthcare applications we are one of the largest product suppliers in the medical markets we serve and have longstanding customer relationships with industryleading medical and laboratory equipment providers additionally many of our medical segment gas and liquid pumps are also used in other technology applications beyond the medical and laboratory sciences within our medical segment we primarily sell through the thomas brand as well as other leading brand names

for financial information about our segments and our geographic areas see note 20 “segment information” in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

our industries and products

we operate in the global markets for flow control and air compression products for the industrial energy and medical industries our highly engineered products and proprietary technologies are focused on serving specialized applications within these attractive and growing industries

industrials

our industrials segment designs manufactures markets and services a broad range of air compression vacuum and blower products across a wide array of technologies compression vacuum and blower products are used in a wide spectrum of applications in nearly all manufacturing and industrial facilities and many service and process industries in a variety of endmarkets including infrastructure construction transportation food and beverage packaging and chemical processing

 

compression products

sales to industrial endmarkets include industrial air compression products as well as associated aftermarket parts consumables and services industrial air compressors compress air to create pressure to power machinery industrial tools material handling systems and automated equipment compressed air is also used in applications as diversified as snow making and fish farming on highspeed trains and in hospitals compressors can be either stationary or portable depending on the requirements of the application or customer because compressed air is utilized as a core component in manufacturing operations in nearly every manufacturing plant it is often referred to as the “fourth utility” in addition to electricity gas and water the global industrial air compressor market is an estimated 132 billion industry and according to frost  sullivan we currently maintain a top three position in this market

we focus on five basic types of air compression technologies rotary screw reciprocating piston scroll rotary vane and centrifugal compressors rotary screw compressors are a newer technology than reciprocating compressors and exhibit better suitability for continuous processes due to a more compact size less maintenance and better noise profile we believe our reciprocating piston compressors provide one of the broadest ranges of pressures in the market and are supported by increasing demand across wideranging attractive endmarkets scroll compressors are most commonly seen where less oilfree air is needed and is most commonly used in medical and food applications where the need for pure clean and precise air is of great importance rotary vane compressors feature high efficiency compact compression technology and can be found throughout all sectors of industry including automotive food and beverage energy and manufacturing with specialist solutions within transit gas and snow making centrifugal compressors are most effective when in applications that demand larger quantities of oilfree air and are utilized across a wide range of industries

vacuum products

industrial vacuum products are integral to manufacturing processes in applications for packaging pneumatic conveying drying holding  lifting distillation evacuation forming  pressing removal and coating within each of these processes are a multitude of subapplications as an example of one such endprocess within packaging a vacuum will be used on blister packaging foil handling labeling carton erection stacking and palletizing placing stacking or transporting goods on pallets as well as central vacuum supply for entire packaging departments management believes that we hold a leading position in our addressable portion of the global vacuum products market

we focus on five basic types of vacuum technologies side channel liquid ring claw vacuum screw and rotary vane vacuum pumps side channel vacuum pumps are used for conveying gases and gasair mixtures in a variety of applications including laser printers packaging soil treatment textiles and food and beverage products liquid ring vacuum pumps are used for extreme conditions which prevail in humid and wet processes across ceramics environmental medical and plastics applications claw vacuum pumps efficiently and economically generate contactfree vacuum for chemical environmental and packaging applications screw vacuum pumps are a dry running technology used to reduce the carbon footprint and life cycle costs in drying and packaging applications rotary vane vacuum pumps are used for vacuum and combined pressure and vacuum applications in the environmental woodworking packaging and food and beverage endmarkets 

blower products

blower products are used for conveying high volumes of air and gas at various flow rates and at low pressures and are utilized in a broad range of industrial and environmental applications including waste water aeration biogas upgrading and conveying pneumatic transport and dehydrating applications for food and beverage cement pharmaceutical petrochemical and mobile industrial applications we also design manufacture market and service frac sand blowers within our industrials segment in many cases blowers are a core component for the operation of the entire endusers’ systems management believes that we hold a leading position in our addressable portion of the global blower products market

we focus on several key technologies within blower products rotary lobe screw claw and vane turbo side channel and radial blowers rotary lobe blowers screw blowers and claw and vane blowers are positive displacement technologies that have the ability to consistently move the same volume of gas or air and vary the volume flow according to the speed of the machine itself enabling it to adapt the flow condition in a flexible manner despite pressure in the system turbo blowers and side channel and radial blowers are dynamic technologies that have the ability to accelerate gas or air through an impeller and transform their kinetic energy at the discharge with some limitation on flexibility

energy

our energy segment designs manufactures markets and services a diverse range of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for a number of attractive growing market sectors with energy exposure spanning upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical applications the high cost of failure in these applications makes quality and reliability key purchase criteria for endusers and drives demand for our highly engineered and differentiated products 

 

upstream

through the manufacture and aftermarket service of pumps and manufacture of associated aftermarket parts and consumables used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well servicing applications our energy segment is wellpositioned to capitalize on an upstream recovery particularly in the north american landbased market where our customers include marketleading hydraulic fracturing also known as pressure pumping and contract drilling service companies as well as certain other types of well service companies sales to upstream energy endmarkets consist of positive displacement pumps and associated aftermarket parts most notably fluid ends as well as consumables and services

 

 

the level of profitability at which new wells can be drilled is a primary driver of drilling and completions activities including hydraulic fracturing thus demand for our energy and industrials products exposed to the upstream energy industry is driven by the prices of crude oil and natural gas and the intensity and activity levels of drilling and hydraulic fracturing importantly according to oil  gas financial journal the threshold oil price at which wells are profitable to drill has significantly decreased by an average across all us shale plays of 47 from 2014 to 2016 as a result of this improvement in well profitability and the crude oil price improvement since the low points observed during the first half of 2016 an increased number of drilling rigs have reentered the market however it is important to note that while the crude oil price level has a meaningful impact on the level of activity in our upstream energy applications the growth in demand for our products into such applications is significantly heightened by numerous other market dynamics and drivers detailed below we believe that these additional market dynamics result in our exposure to the upstream energy industry being among the most attractive in the present environment

we believe we are exposed to some of the highest growth market drivers in the context of an upstream energy recovery secular industry trends are driving increased demand for and utilization of newer fitforpurpose equipment with innovations that increase productivity and are increasing the frequency of replacement refurbishment and upgrade cycles of pumping equipment and associated consumable products used in drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity the number of wells drilled is growing at a faster rate than active rig count with each active rig drilling more unconventional wells per unit of time than previously experienced further each unconventional well on average is being drilled with longer laterals and more hydraulic fracturing stages per well moreover this quickly growing demand for hydraulic fracturing horsepower in conjunction with the usage of more volume of abrasive proppant per well is resulting in accelerated wear and tear on frac pumps and associated aftermarket parts and consumables as a result there are multiple drivers of growth in frac pumps and associated aftermarket parts including fluid ends consumables and services that are incremental to active rig count creating a growth profile that is leveraged to but meaningfully accelerated relative to the active rig count 

midstream and downstream

sales to midstream and downstream energy endmarkets consist of liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors and integrated systems engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts and services according to petrochemical update north american downstream industry capital expenditures are expected to reach 173 billion in 2018 with the maintenance capital expenditure portion for us refineries estimated to increase 39 in 2018 to a total of 13 billion these large investments in midstream and downstream energy endmarkets are expected to drive sales of our equipment and future sales in aftermarket parts and services as these facilities age further deferred maintenance of downstream energy infrastructure is expected to drive increased future sales in our replacement products and aftermarket parts and services our downstream energy business contributes a larger share of revenue and profitability than our midstream energy business

 

we focus on two basic types of midstream and downstream energy equipment fluid transfer equipment and liquid ring vacuum pumps and compressors which are employed in the midstream and downstream markets respectively

 

 

petrochemical

our energy segment is positioned to capitalize on the large and growing petrochemical industry sales to petrochemical endmarkets consist of vacuum and compression process systems both of which are used in harsh continuousduty applications according to the american chemistry council us chemical industry capital spending reached 319 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a 62 cagr from 2017 to 2019 further the american chemistry council forecasts the annual us capital spending by the chemical industry to reach 48 billion by 2022 more than double the level of spending in 2010

demand for our petrochemical industry products correlates with growth in the development of new petrochemical plants as well as activity levels therein which drive demand for aftermarket parts and services on our marketleading installed base of equipment attractive secular trends in the petrochemical market provide additional sources of growth advancements in the development of unconventional natural gas resources in north america over the past decade have resulted in the abundant availability of locallysourced natural gas as feedstock for petrochemical plants in north america supporting longterm growth in addition new petrochemical plants are becoming larger driving increased demand for more equipment within larger systems

medical

the medical segment designs manufactures and markets a broad range of flow control products for the durable medical equipment laboratory vacuum and automated liquid handling endmarkets key technologies include gas liquid and precision syringe pumps and automated liquid handling systems

based on internal estimates the durable medical equipment pump market represents approximately a 12 billion opportunity globally and can be divided into two primary submarkets gas pumps and liquid pumps in both markets energy efficiency ultralow vibration reduced noise levels and compactness as compared to flow rate are key application considerations customers are mainly medium and large durable medical equipment manufacturers who integrate our products into their devices for a wide range of applications such as aspirators blood analyzers blood pressure monitors compression therapy dental carts dialysis machines gas monitors and ventilators gas pumps transfer and compress gases and generate vacuum to enable precise flow conditions we estimate the size of the global gas pump market to be approximately 700 million building on our strength in gas pump applications we recently expanded into the liquid pump and automated liquid handling markets to gain share in sizable markets that were previously unaddressed by us we estimate the liquid pump market to be a 450 million market globally our liquid pump products are primarily used to meter and transfer both neutral and chemically aggressive fluids we view this space as an attractive adjacency to our existing strategy and one in which we are able to capture share in line with current operations in the gas pump market building momentum and scale for our medical business we believe both gas and liquid pump markets present attractive longterm growth profiles based on strong secular trends

our products are also used in the laboratory vacuum equipment space which includes enduse chemically resistant devices used in research and commercial laboratories which is a highly attractive niche market in addition we recently expanded into the automated liquid handling endmarket which includes syringe pumps systems and accessories that are integrated into large scale automated liquid handling systems primarily for clinical pharmaceutical and environmental analyses

customers in the durable medical pump endmarket and the automated liquid handling endmarket develop and manufacture equipment used in a highly regulated environment requiring highly specialized technologies as a result relationships with customers are built based on a supplier’s longterm reputation and expertise and deep involvement throughout a product’s evolution from concept to longterm commercialization customers value suppliers that can provide global research and development regulatory and manufacturing support as well as sales footprint and expertise to foster close relationships with key decision makers at their company combined with the long product life cycle in the regulated medical device space these factors create a strong recurring base of business as a leading pump manufacturer in these markets we have established a history of innovation that enables us to work closely with our customers to create highly customized flow control solutions for their unique applications these products are missioncritical in the ultimate device in which they are deployed and remain a key component over the entire life cycle of the end products the regulated market structure and nature of longtenured customer relationships enables pump manufacturers to have a highly visible recurring revenue stream from key customers

 

competition

industrials

the industrial endmarkets we serve are competitive with an increasing focus on product quality performance energy efficiency customer service and local presence although there are several large manufacturers of compression vacuum and blower products the marketplace for these products remains highly fragmented due to the wide variety of product technologies applications and selling channels our principal competitors in sales of compression vacuum and blower products in our industrials segment include atlas copco ab ingersollrand plc colfax corp flowserve corporation idex corporation accudyne and kaeser compressors inc

energy

across our product lines exposed to the energy industry the competitive landscape is specific to the endmarkets served our principal competitor for drilling pumps is national oilwell varco inc and for frac pumps is the weir group plc within upstream energy we additionally compete with certain smaller regional manufacturers of pumps and aftermarket parts although these are not direct competitors for most of our products our principal competitors in sales of fluid transfer equipment include dover corporation svt gmbh and technipfmc plc our principal competitors in the sale of liquid ring pumps and compressors are flowserve corporation and buschholding gmbh

medical

competition in the medical pump market is primarily based on product quality and performance as most products must be qualified by the customer for a particular use further there is an increasing demand for more efficient healthcare solutions which is driving the adoption of premium and high performance systems our primary competitors in medical pumps include idex corporation watsonmarlow inc knf neuberger inc and thermo fisher scientific as well as other regional and local manufacturers

customers and customer service

we consider superior customer service to be one of our primary pillars of future success and view it as being built upon a foundation of critical application expertise an industry leading range of compressor pump vacuum and blower products a global manufacturing and sales presence and a longstanding reputation for quality and reliability intense customer focus is at the center of our vision of becoming the industry’s first choice for innovative and applicationcritical flow control and compression equipment services and solutions we strive to collaborate with our customers and become an essential part of their engineering process by drawing on our deep industry and application engineering experience to develop bestinclass products that are critical to the processes and systems in which they operate

we have established strong and longstanding customer relationships with numerous industry leaders we sell our products directly to enduse customers and to certain oems and indirectly through independent distributors and sales representatives our energy and medical products are primarily sold directly to enduse customers and oems while approximately 50 of our industrials sales in 2017 were fulfilled through independent distributors and sales representatives

we use a direct sales force to serve enduse customers and oems because these customers typically require higher levels of technical assistance more coordinated shipment scheduling and more complex product service than customers that purchase through distributors we have distribution centers and warehouses that stock parts accessories and certain products to provide adequate and timely availability in addition we provide direct aftermarket support through our service and remanufacturing facilities in the united states germany finland france spain the united kingdom china and australia

in addition to our direct sales force we are also committed to developing and supporting our global network of over 1000 distributors and representatives who we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets and industries we serve these distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and parts and provide aftermarket services to endusers while most distributors provide a broad range of products from different suppliers we view our distributors as exclusive at the product category level eg compressor vacuum and blower for example a distributor may exclusively carry our compressor technologies and also source additional components of the broader industrial system in which those products operate from other suppliers our service personnel and product engineers provide the distributors’ service representatives with technical assistance and field training particularly with respect to installation and repair of equipment we also provide our distributors with sales and product literature advertising and sales promotions orderentry and tracking systems and an annual restocking program furthermore we participate in major trade shows and directly market our offerings to generate sales leads and support the distributors’ sales personnel

 

our customer base is diverse and we did not have any customers that individually provided more than 4 of 2017 consolidated revenues

research and development

our rd expenditures focus on developing new products and new product applications to among other things enhance and expand existing product capabilities and performance improve efficiency reduce size weight and noise levels increase application flexibility and maintain compliance with changing regulatory requirements

for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we spent approximately 26 million 22 million and 26 million respectively on research activities relating to the development of new products and new product applications all such expenditures were funded by us and were expensed as incurred

patents trademarks and other intellectual property

we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property while in the aggregate our more than 570 patents and our trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of our products we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence creativity and   marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent or trademark and therefore we do not consider any single patent or trademark group of patents or trademarks copyright or trade secret to be material to our business as a whole except for the gardner denver trademark we have registered our trademarks in the countries we deem necessary or in our best interest we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and techniques and we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees as well as our suppliers and other third parties receiving such information

pursuant to trademark license agreements cooper industries has exclusive rights to use the gardner denver trademark for certain power tools and their components meaning that we are prevented from using our mark in connection with those products

raw materials and suppliers

we purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products our most significant commodity exposures are to cast iron aluminum and steel additionally we purchase a large number of motors and therefore are also exposed to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors most of our raw materials are generally available from a number of suppliers we have a limited number of longterm contracts with some suppliers of key components but we believe that our sources of raw materials and components are reliable and adequate for our needs we use single sources of supply for certain castings motors and other select engineered components a disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers nevertheless we believe that we have appropriately balanced this risk against the cost of maintaining a greater number of suppliers moreover we have sought and will continue to seek cost reductions in purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases and pursuing alternate sources of supply

employees

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 6400 employees of which approximately 2050 are located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions we believe that our current relations with employees are satisfactory

 

environmental matters

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage handling emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area we have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws we have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes we are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes such as the us federal “superfund” and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the “superfund” or similar state laws see “part i item 3 legal proceedings—environmental liabilities”

 item 1a risk factors

tableend 

the following risk factors as well as the other information included in this form 10k including “selected historical consolidated financial data” “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be carefully considered any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations the selected risks described below however are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

risks related to our business

we have exposure to the risks associated with instability in the global economy and financial markets which may negatively impact our revenues liquidity suppliers and customers

our financial performance depends in large part on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy which impacts these markets any sustained weakness in demand for our products and services resulting from a contraction or uncertainty in the global economy could adversely impact our revenues and profitability

in addition we believe that many of our suppliers and customers access global credit markets to provide liquidity and in some cases utilize external financing to purchase products or finance operations if our customers are unable to access credit markets or lack liquidity it may impact customer demand for our products and services

 

furthermore our products are sold in many industries some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic contractions for example weakness in upstream energy activity in north america significantly impacted our business in 2015 and 2016 cyclical weakness in the industries that we serve could adversely affect demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance

more than half of our sales and operations are in nonus jurisdictions and we are subject to the economic political regulatory and other risks of international operations

for the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 56 of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states we have manufacturing facilities in germany the united kingdom china finland italy india and other countries we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available nonus operations and united states export sales could be adversely affected as a result of political or economic instability in certain countries differences in foreign laws including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights credit risks currency fluctuations in particular changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar euro british pound and the chinese renminbi exchange controls changes in tariff restrictions significant changes in importexport trade restrictions royalty and tax increases nationalization of private enterprises civil unrest and protests strikes acts of terrorism war or other armed conflict shipping products during times of crisis or war and other factors inherent in foreign operations

in addition our expansion into new countries may require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel which will divert resources from our existing business operations as we expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks associated with our international operations

our revenues and operating results especially in the energy segment depend on the level of activity in the energy industry which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices

demand for certain products of our energy segment particularly in the upstream energy market depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration development and production and is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and ultimately oil and natural gas prices overall the energy market is volatile as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates generally when worldwide demand or our customers’ expectations of future prices for these commodities are depressed the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced other factors including availability of quality drilling prospects exploration success relative production costs and political and regulatory environments are also expected to affect the demand for our products worldwide military political and economic events have in the past contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future accordingly our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period as the markets for our products have historically experienced volatility in particular orders in the energy segment have historically corresponded to demand for oil and gas and petrochemical products and have been influenced by prices and inventory levels for oil and natural gas rig count number of wells those rigs drill annually the amount of hydraulic fracturing horsepower required on average to fracture each well and other economic factors which we cannot reasonably predict the energy segment generated approximately 43 of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2017

our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

we conduct our business in many different currencies a significant portion of our revenue approximately 52 for the year ended december 31 2017 is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar accordingly currency exchange rates and in particular unfavorable movement in the exchange rates between us dollars and euros british pounds and chinese renminbi affect our operating results the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results are unpredictable because of the number of currencies in which we do business and the potential volatility of exchange rates we are also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations although historically not significant if currency controls were enacted in countries where the company generates significant cash balances these controls may limit our ability to convert currencies into us dollars or other currencies as needed or to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in the countries imposing such controls which could adversely affect our liquidity currency devaluations could also negatively affect our operating margins and cash flows

 

potential governmental regulations restricting the use and increased public attention to and litigation regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing or other processes on which it relies could reduce demand for our products

oil and natural gas extracted from unconventional sources such as shale tight sands and coal bed methane frequently requires hydraulic fracturing recent initiatives to study regulate or otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing and processes on which it relies such as water disposal as well as litigation over hydraulic fracturing impacts could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

for example although hydraulic fracturing currently is generally exempt from regulation under the us safe drinking water act’s “sdwa” underground injection control program and is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process these include among others a number of regulations issued and other steps taken by the us environmental protection agency “epa” over the last five years including its new source performance standards issued in 2012 its june 2016 rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category and its june 2016 rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and the federal bureau of land management “blm” rule in march 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and american indian lands which was the subject of litigation and which the blm rescinded in december 2017 while the newly appointed epa administrator and the trump administration more generally have indicated their interest in scaling back or rescinding regulations that inhibit the development of the us oil and gas industry it is difficult to predict the extent to which such policies will be implemented or the outcome of any litigation challenging such implementation such as the suit the state of california’s attorney general filed in january 2018 challenging the blm’s rescission of its march 2015 rule referred to above

moreover some states and local governments have adopted and other governmental entities are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations for example texas colorado and north dakota among others have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations states could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether following the approach taken by the state of new york in 2015 local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular some state and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity for example in december 2016 the oklahoma corporation commission’s oil and gas conservation division the “occ division” and the oklahoma geologic survey released well completion seismicity guidance which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions including mitigation following anomalous seismic activity within 125 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations and in february 2017 the occ division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce earthquakes in the state ongoing lawsuits have also alleged that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and natural gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal the adoption of more stringent regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and the outcome of litigation over hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect some of our customers and their demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we face competition in the markets we serve which could materially and adversely affect our operating results

we actively compete with many companies producing similar products depending on the particular product and application we experience competition based on a number of factors including price quality performance and availability we compete against many companies including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess as a result these competitors may be both domestically and internationally better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the global economy as a whole

in addition our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors including new competitors entering our markets new products and services that may be introduced by competitors changes in customer preferences pricing pressures and new government regulations if we are unable to anticipate our competitors’ development of new products and services identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or successfully introduce new products and services or modify existing products and service offerings in response to such competitive factors we could lose customers to competitors if we cannot compete successfully our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected

large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials and component parts substantial decreases in their availability or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results

our primary raw materials directly and indirectly are cast iron aluminum and steel we also purchase a large number of motors and therefore also have exposure to changes in the price of copper which is a primary component of motors we have longterm contracts with only a few suppliers of key components consequently we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices and availability of such raw materials factors such as supply and demand freight costs and transportation availability inventory levels of brokers and dealers the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price and availability of raw materials in addition we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings motors and other select engineered components that are critical in the manufacturing of our products from time to time in recent years we have experienced disruptions to our supply deliveries for raw materials and component parts and may experience further supply disruptions any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and therefore our operating results

 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of our customer base

we derive revenue from certain key customers in particular with respect to our oilfield service products and services the loss or reduction of significant contracts with any of these key customers could result in a material decrease of our future profitability and cash flows in addition the consolidation or vertical integration of key customers may result in the loss of certain customer contracts or impact demand or competition for our products any changes in such customers’ purchasing practices or decline in such customers’ financial condition may have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition some of our customers are significantly larger than we are have greater financial and other resources and also have the ability to purchase products from our competitors as a result of their size and position in the marketplace some of our customers have significant purchasing leverage and could cause us to materially reduce the price of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition in the petroleum product market lost sales may be difficult to replace due to the relative concentration of the customer base we are unable to predict what effect consolidation in our customers’ industries may have on prices capital spending by customers selling strategies competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with customers

the loss of or disruption in our distribution network could have a negative impact on our abilities to ship products meet customer demand and otherwise operate our business

we sell a significant portion of our products through independent distributors and sales representatives we rely in large part on the orderly operation of this distribution network which depends on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management we conduct all of our shipping through independent third parties although we believe that our receiving shipping and distribution process is efficient and wellpositioned to support our operations and strategic plans we cannot provide assurance that we have anticipated all issues or that events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other catastrophic events labor disagreements acquisition of distributors by a competitor consolidation within our distributor network or shipping problems will not disrupt our distribution network if complications arise within a segment of our distribution network the remaining network may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands any of these disruptions or complications could negatively impact our revenues and costs

our ongoing and expected restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect to result from these actions our operating results could be negatively affected by our inability to effectively implement such restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives

we continually seek ways to simplify or improve processes eliminate excess capacity and reduce costs in all areas of our operations which from time to time includes restructuring activities we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our global manufacturing sales and distribution footprint which include workforce reductions and facility consolidations from 2015 to 2017 we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 429 million across our segments in connection with these initiatives costs of future initiatives may be material and the savings associated with them are subject to a variety of risks including our inability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel rationalize manufacturing capacity synchronize information technology systems consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities as a result the contemplated costs to effect these initiatives may materially exceed estimates the initiatives we are contemplating may require consultation with various employees labor representatives or regulators and such consultations may influence the timing costs and extent of expected savings and may result in the loss of skilled employees in connection with the initiatives

although we have considered the impact of local regulations negotiations with employee representatives and the related costs associated with our restructuring activities factors beyond the control of management may affect the timing of these projects and therefore affect when savings will be achieved under the plans there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all or that we will realize the projected benefits of these and other restructuring and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement our cost savings initiatives our business may be adversely affected moreover our continued implementation of cost savings initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

in addition as we consolidate facilities and relocate manufacturing processes to lowercost regions our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet customer demand and maintain a high level of quality throughout the transition failure to adequately meet customer demand or maintain a high level or quality could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel

our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel many of whom have joined the company since the kkr transaction and their ability to provide us with uninterrupted leadership and direction the failure to retain our executive officers and other key personnel or a failure to provide adequate succession plans could have an adverse impact the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust however we provide longterm equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a longterm commitment to us our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract retain and develop qualified personnel a failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan

credit and counterparty risks could harm our business

the financial condition of our customers could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables in addition financial difficulties faced by our customers as a result of an adverse economic event or other market factors may lead to cancellation or delay of orders our customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a product or solution when payments become due or they may decide not to pay us either as a matter of corporate decisionmaking or in response to changes in local laws and regulations although historically not material we cannot be certain that in the future expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues earnings and cash flows

if we are unable to develop new products and technologies our competitive position may be impaired which could materially and adversely affect our sales and market share

the markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technologies and introductions of new products and services our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and technologies or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and materially and adversely affect our competitive position we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful if we do not compete successfully our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages could negatively impact our results particularly with respect to fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products

a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through fixedprice contracts for custom engineered products certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract or require that we at our expense correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects because substantially all of our custom engineered product contracts are at a fixed price we face the risk that cost overruns delays penalties or liquidated damages may exceed erode or eliminate our expected profit margin or cause us to record a loss on our projects

the risk of noncompliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives

our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws regulations and policies which could result in conflicting legal requirements these laws and regulations are complex change frequently have become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business these laws and regulations include import and export control environmental health and safety regulations data privacy requirements international labor laws and work councils and anticorruption and bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the un convention against bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials

we are subject to the risk that we our employees our affiliated entities contractors agents or their respective officers directors employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws for which we might be held responsible particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions an actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil or criminal penalties debarment from government contracts curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions competitive or reputational harm litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or strategic objectives

 

us federal income tax reform could adversely affect us

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that will affect 2017 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property

the tax act also establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018 including but not limited to 1 reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate 2 elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” 3 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” a new minimum tax 4 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 5 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits “ftc” and a deduction of up to 50 to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction 8 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 9 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability and 10 limitations on net operating losses “nol” generated after december 31 2017 to 80 of taxable income

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act we have recorded a discrete net tax benefit of 953 million in the period ending december 31 2017 this net expense benefit primarily consists of 1 a net expense benefit for the corporate rate reduction of 896 million 2 a net expense for the transition tax of 633 million and 3 a corresponding reduction of the repatriation liability under asc 74030 formerly accounting principles board 23 of 690 million

for various reasons we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act if we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete we recorded provisional adjustments as described above if we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements we have not recorded any adjustments related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the tax act as we complete our accounting of the income tax effects of the tax act we anticipate that we may record additional charges or benefits at such time as prescribed by asc 740 and sab 118 and as further information becomes available regarding the tax act we may make further adjustments to the provisions that have been recorded in our financial statements we also continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business

the future impacts of the tax act on holders of our common shares are uncertain and could in certain instances be adverse we urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock

a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired

as a result of the kkr transaction we applied the acquisition method of accounting and established a new basis of accounting on july 30 2013 goodwill is recorded as the difference if any between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest intangible assets including goodwill are assigned to our reporting units based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition in accordance with gaap goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in 2017 we recorded an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 16 million primarily within the industrials segment in 2016 we recorded an impairment charge related to other intangible assets of 253 million primarily within the industrials segment in 2015 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 3433 million within the energy segment and recorded impairment charges related to other intangible assets of 781 million within our industrials energy and medical segments as of december 31 2017 the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets net represented 26588 million or 58 of our total assets a future impairment if any could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial position or results of operations see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets and the associated charges taken

 

our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages union and work council campaigns or other labor difficulties

as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 6400 employees of which approximately 2050 were located in the united states of those employees located outside of the united states a significant portion are represented by works councils and labor unions and of those employees located in the united states approximately 200 are represented by labor unions although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages work stoppages have occurred and may in the future occur and we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements in addition negotiations with our union employees may 1 result in significant increases in our cost of labor 2 divert management’s attention away from operating our business or 3 break down and result in the disruption of our operations the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs andor decreased operating results

we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits which could adversely affect our financial condition

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants we believe that given our financial reserves and anticipated insurance recoveries the pending and potential future lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity however future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case discussed below or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome in addition even if any damages payable by us in any individual lawsuit are not material the aggregate damages and related defense costs could be material and could materially adversely affect our financial condition if we were to receive an adverse judgment in a number of these lawsuits accordingly the resolution of pending or future lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity see “business—legal proceedings—asbestos and silicarelated litigation”

acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect our operating results

we have acquired businesses in the past and may continue to acquire businesses or assets in the future the acquisition and integration of businesses or assets involves a number of risks the core risks are valuation negotiating a fair price for the business integration managing the process of integrating the acquired company’s people products technology and other assets to extract the value and synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition regulation obtaining necessary regulatory or other government approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions and diligence identifying undisclosed or unknown liabilities or restrictions that will be assumed in the acquisition

in addition acquisitions outside of the united states often involve additional or increased risks including for example

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel the diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of an acquired company’s operations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or prospects

a natural disaster catastrophe or other event could result in severe property damage which could adversely affect our operations

some of our operations involve risks of among other things property damage which could curtail our operations for example disruptions in operations or damage to a manufacturing plant could reduce our ability to produce products and satisfy customer demand if one of more of our manufacturing facilities are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster accident catastrophe or event our operations could be significantly interrupted similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that provide supplies or other raw materials to our plants or other stoppages arising from factors beyond our control these interruptions might involve significant damage to among other things property and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to many months for a major interruption

 

information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our customers

our business is highly dependent on financial accounting and other dataprocessing systems and other communications and information systems including our enterprise resource planning tools we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems if any of these systems fail whether caused by fire other natural disaster power or telecommunications failure acts of cyber terrorism or war or otherwise or they do not function correctly we could suffer financial loss business disruption liability to our customers regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions our ability to grow could be limited although we have backup systems procedures and capabilities in place they may also fail or be inadequate further to the extent that we may have customer information in our databases any unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information could result in claims under data protection laws and regulations if any of these risks materialize our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected

the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims which could harm our business

customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property equipment or the environment in addition our products are integral to the production process for some endusers and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations although we maintain quality controls and procedures we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are currently adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size and we limit our liability by contract wherever possible however we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety under such laws and regulations we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or put into effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases

we use and generate hazardous substances and waste in our manufacturing operations in addition many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs that are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury

our success depends in part on the creation maintenance and protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights confidentiality provisions contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights our nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of breach of such agreements or unauthorized disclosure of such information and if a competitor lawfully obtains or independently develops our trade secrets we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using such technology or information to compete with us either of which could harm our competitive position our applications for patent and trademark protection may not be granted or the claims or scope of such issued patents or registered trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some foreign countries we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights and we cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing infringement or misappropriation if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights our competitive position could suffer which could harm our operating results

 

although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties the steps we take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of the intellectual property of others may not be successful and from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party responding to and defending such claims regardless of their merit can be costly and timeconsuming can divert management’s attention and other resources and we may not prevail depending on the resolution of such claims we may be barred from using a specific technology or other rights may be required to redesign or reengineer a product which may require significant resources may be required to enter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all or may become liable for significant damages

if any of the foregoing occurs our ability to compete could be affected or our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected

we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations

we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide as of december 31 2017 our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 972 million “unfunded status” compared to 1244 million as of december 31 2016 estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates rates of compensation increases expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates if our assumptions prove incorrect our funding obligations may increase which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results

we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities a deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on our operations financial condition and liquidity

risks related to our indebtedness

our substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences and adversely affect our financial condition

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2017 we had total indebtedness of 20402 million and we had availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement of 3526 million and 668 million respectively our high level of debt could have important consequences including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors increasing our cost of borrowing and hampering our ability to execute on our growth strategy for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control as well as and including those factors discussed under “risks related to our business” above we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to implement any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations

 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and the lenders under the revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and our secured lenders including the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation

despite our level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt including offbalance sheet financing contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future including offbalance sheet financings contractual obligations and general and commercial liabilities although the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 250 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we also can incur additional secured indebtedness under the term loan facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the term loan facilities if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we now face could intensify for a complete description of the company’s credit facilities and definitions of capitalized terms used in this section see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions

the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness pay dividends make other distributions in respect of or repurchase or redeem capital stock prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt make loans investments and other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of assets incur liens enter into transactions with affiliates enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets make needed capital expenditures make strategic acquisitions investments or enter into joint ventures plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies and engage in business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest

a breach of the covenants under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt principal andor related interest payments and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings andor interest we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables financing agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease

we utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or nonperformance of these instruments

we have entered into payfixed interest rate swaps instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates such instruments will result in economic losses should interest rates not rise above the payfixed interest rate in the derivative contracts we will be exposed to creditrelated losses which could impact the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps see note 16 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

 

if the financial institutions that are part of the syndicate of our revolving credit facility fail to extend credit under our facility or reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility our liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected

we have access to capital through our revolving credit facility which is part of our senior secured credit facilities each financial institution which is part of the syndicate for our revolving credit facility is responsible on a several but not joint basis for providing a portion of the loans to be made under our facility if any participant or group of participants with a significant portion of the commitments in our revolving credit facility fails to satisfy its or their respective obligations to extend credit under the facility and we are unable to find a replacement for such participant or participants on a timely basis if at all our liquidity may be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings

tableend 

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth below

 

environmental matters

we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage handling emission and disposal of materials and discharge of materials into the environment we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area we have an environmental policy that confirms our commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws we have an active environmental management program aimed at complying with existing environmental regulations and reducing the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes we are also subject to laws concerning the cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes such as the us federal “superfund” and similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under the “superfund” or similar state laws

asbestos and silicarelated litigation

we have been named as a defendant in many asbestosrelated and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically we are one of approximately 25 or more named defendants our predecessors sometimes manufactured distributed andor sold products allegedly at issue in these pending asbestos and silicarelated lawsuits the “products” however neither we nor our predecessors ever mined manufactured mixed produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits moreover the asbestoscontaining components of the products if any were enclosed within the subject products

although we have never mined manufactured mixed produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica many of the companies that did engage in such activities or produced such products are no longer in operation this has led to law firms seeking potential alternative companies to name in lawsuits where there has been an asbestos or silica related injury however in our opinion based on our experience to date the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility

we believe that the pending and future asbestos and silicarelated lawsuits are not likely to in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity based on our anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters the limited potential asbestos exposure from the products described above our opinion based on our experience to date that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which we otherwise bear responsibility various potential defenses available to us with respect to such matters and our prior disposition of comparable matters however inherent uncertainties of litigation and future developments including without limitation potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants an adverse determination in the adams county case discussed below or other inability to collect from our historical insurers or indemnitors could cause a different outcome while the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain based on presently known facts experience and circumstances we believe that the amounts accrued on the company’s balance sheet are adequate and that the liabilities arising from the asbestos and silicarelated personal injury lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to include a total litigation reserve of 1056 million and 1085 million as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation asbestosrelated defense costs are excluded from the asbestos claims liability and are recorded separately as an operating expense as services are incurred we currently expect to continue to incur significant asbestosrelated defense costs in the event of unexpected future developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be material to the company’s consolidated financial position results of operation or liquidity and defense costs may be material however at this time based on presently available information we view this possibility as remote

we have entered into a series of agreements with certain of the company’s or the company’s predecessors’ legacy insurers and certain potential indemnitors to secure insurance coverage andor reimbursement for the costs associated with the asbestos and silicarelated lawsuits filed against us we have also pursued litigation against certain insurers or indemnitors where necessary we have an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestos related recoveries of approximately 1004 million and 973 million which is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively

the largest such recent action gardner denver inc v certain underwriters at lloyd’s london et al was filed on july 9 2010 in the eighth judicial circuit adams county illinois as case number 10l48 the “adams county case” in the lawsuit we seek among other things to require certain excess insurer defendants to honor their insurance policy obligations to us including payment in whole or in part of the costs associated with the asbestosrelated lawsuits filed against us in october 2011 we reached a settlement with one of the insurer defendants which had issued both primary and excess policies for approximately the amount of such defendant’s policies which were subject to the lawsuit since then the case has been proceeding through the discovery and motions process with the remaining insurer defendants on january 29 2016 we prevailed on the first phase of that discovery and motions process “phase i” specifically the court in the adams county case ruled that we have rights under all of the policies in the case subject to their terms and conditions even though the policies were sold to our former owners rather than to the company itself on june 9 2016 the court denied a motion by several of the insurers who sought permission to appeal the phase i ruling now rather than waiting until the end of the whole case as is normally required the case has now begun proceeding through the discovery and motions process regarding the remaining issues in dispute

 

a majority of our expected future recoveries of the costs associated with the asbestosrelated lawsuits are the subject of the adams county case

the amounts we recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities and insurance recoveries are based on currently available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our evaluation of relevant factors with input from a third party actuarial expert our actual liabilities or insurance recoveries could be higher or lower than those recorded if actual results vary significantly from the assumptions there are a number of key variables and assumptions including the number and type of new claims to be filed each year the resolution or outcome of these claims the average cost of resolution of each new claim the amount of insurance available allocation methodologies the contractual terms with each insurer with whom we have reached settlements the resolution of coverage issues with other excess insurance carriers with whom we have not yet achieved settlements and the solvency risk with respect to our insurance carriers other factors that may affect our future liability include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case legal rulings that may be made by state and federal courts and the passage of state or federal legislation we make the necessary adjustments for our asbestos liability and corresponding insurance recoveries on an annual basis unless facts or circumstances warrant assessment as of an interim date

environmental liabilities

we have been identified as a potentially responsible party “prp” with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal “superfund” or similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites although these laws impose joint and several liability on prps in application the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp based on currently available information our company was only a small contributor to these waste sites and we have or are attempting to negotiate de minimis settlements for our cleanup the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and our future obligations entail a share of the sites’ ongoing operating and maintenance expense we are also addressing four onsite cleanups for which we are the primary responsible party three of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and one is in the implementation stage

we have an accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet of 75 million and 76 million as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 respectively to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for our remaining financial obligations for the environmental matters discussed above and which does not anticipate that any of these matters will result in material additional costs beyond amounts accrued based upon consideration of currently available information we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal state local or foreign environmental laws or regulations or cleanup costs relating to these matters

components of our revenue and expenses

revenues

we generate revenue from sales of our highly engineered applicationcritical products and by providing associated aftermarket parts consumables and services we sell our products and deliver aftermarket services both directly to endusers and through independent distribution channels depending on the product line and geography below is a description of our revenues by segment and factors impacting total revenues

industrials revenue

our industrials segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of air compression vacuum and blower products to customers in multiple industries and geographies a significant portion of our sales in the industrials segment are made to independent distributors revenue is recognized when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss are passed to the customer and collection is reasonably assured our large installed base of products in our industrials segment drives demand for recurring aftermarket support services primarily composed of replacement parts sales to our distribution partners and to a lesser extent by directly providing replacement parts and repair and maintenance services to end customers revenue for services is recognized when services are performed historically our shipments and revenues have peaked during the fourth quarter as our customers seek to fully utilize annual capital spending budgets 

 

energy revenue

our energy segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of positive displacement pumps liquid ring vacuum pumps compressors and integrated systems and engineered fluid loading and transfer equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for use primarily in upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical endmarkets across multiple geographies certain contracts with customers in the mid and downstream and petrochemical markets are higher sales value and often have longer lead times and involve more application specific engineering revenue is recognized for these arrangements when the contract is complete or substantially complete provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the arrangement is considered substantially complete when the company receives acceptance and remaining tasks are perfunctory or inconsequential and in control of the company provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable as a result the timing of these contracts can result in significant variation in reported revenue from quarter to quarter our large installed base of products in our energy segment drives demand for recurring aftermarket support services to customers including replacement parts consumables and repair and maintenance services the mix of aftermarket to original equipment revenue within the energy segment is impacted by trends in upstream energy activity in north america revenue for services is recognized when services are performed in response to customer demand for faster access to aftermarket parts and repair services we expanded our direct aftermarket service locations in our energy segment particularly in north american markets driven by upstream energy activity energy segment products and aftermarket parts consumables and services are sold both directly to end customers and through independent distributors depending on the product category and geography

medical revenue

our medical segment revenues are generated primarily through sales of highly specialized gas liquid and precision syringe pumps that are specified by medical and laboratory equipment suppliers for use in medical and laboratory applications our products are often subject to extensive collaborative design and specification requirements as they are generally components specifically designed for and integrated into our customers’ products revenue is recognized when products are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pass to the customer and collection is reasonably assured our medical segment has no substantive aftermarket revenues

expenses

cost of sales

cost of sales includes the costs we incur including purchased materials labor and overhead related to manufactured products and aftermarket parts sold during a period depreciation related to manufacturing equipment and facilities is included in cost of sales purchased materials represent the majority of costs of sales with steel aluminum copper and partially finished castings representing our most significant materials inputs we have instituted a global sourcing strategy to take advantage of coordinated purchasing opportunities of key materials across our manufacturing plant locations

cost of sales for services includes the direct costs we incur including direct labor parts and other overhead costs including depreciation of equipment and facilities to deliver repair maintenance and other field services to our customers

selling and administrative expenses

selling and administrative expenses consist of i salaries and other employeerelated expenses for our selling and administrative functions and other activities not associated with the manufacture of products or delivery of services to customers ii facility operating expenses for selling and administrative activities including office rent maintenance depreciation and insurance iii marketing and direct costs of selling products and services to customers including internal and external sales commissions iv research and development expenditures v professional and consultant fees vi sponsor fees and expenses vii expenses related to our public stock offerings and to establish public company reporting compliance and viii other miscellaneous expenses certain corporate expenses including those related to our shared service centers in the united states and europe that directly benefit our businesses are allocated to our business segments certain corporate administrative expenses including corporate executive compensation treasury certain information technology internal audit and tax compliance are not allocated to the business segments

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets includes the periodic amortization of intangible assets recognized when an affiliate of our sponsor acquired us on july 30 2013 and intangible assets recognized in connection with businesses we acquired since july 30 2013 including customer relationships and trademarks

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets includes noncash charges we recognized for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

 

other operating expense net

other operating expense net includes foreign currency gains and losses restructuring charges certain litigation and contract settlement losses environmental remediation stockbased compensation expense and other miscellaneous operating expenses

benefit or provision for income taxes

the benefit or provision for income taxes includes us federal state and local income taxes and all nonus income taxes we are subject to income tax in approximately 33 jurisdictions outside of the united states because we conduct operations on a global basis our effective tax rate depends and will continue to depend on the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among several different taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate can also vary based on changes in the tax rates of the different jurisdictions the availability of tax credits and nondeductible items

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that affected 2017 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and 3 a change in us deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to the us tax rate reduction from 35 to 21

items affecting our reported results

general economic conditions and capital spending in the industries we serve

our financial results closely follow changes in the industries and endmarkets we serve demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers the level of capital expenditures depends in turn on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost in particular demand for our industrials products generally correlates with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production capacity utilization rates above 80 have historically indicated a strong demand environment for industrial equipment in our energy segment demand for our products that serve upstream energy endmarkets are influenced heavily by energy prices and the expectation as to future trends in those prices energy prices have historically been cyclical in nature and are affected by a wide range of factors as energy prices start improving from low levels observed in the first half of 2016 we have observed increases in drilled but uncompleted wells global land rig count wells and footage drilled as well as drilling and completion capital expenditures to positively impact our results of operations in the midstream and downstream portions of our energy segment overall economic growth and industrial production as well as secular trends impact demand for our products in our medical segment we expect demand for our products to be driven by favorable trends including the growth in healthcare spend and expansion of healthcare systems due to an aging population requiring medical care and increased investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures in emerging economies over longer time periods we believe that demand for all of our products also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gdp around the world as augmented by secular trends in each segment our ability to grow and our financial performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations including efficiently utilizing our global sales manufacturing and distribution capabilities and engineering innovative new product applications for endusers in a variety of geographic markets

foreign currency fluctuations

a significant portion of our revenues approximately 52 for the year ended december 31 2017 were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the united states a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion

seasonality

historically our shipments and revenues have peaked during the fourth quarter as our customers seek to fully utilize annual capital spending budgets also our emea operations generally experience a slowdown during the july august and december holiday seasons general economic conditions may however impact future seasonal variations

 

factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations

as a result of a number of factors our historical results of operations are not comparable from period to period and may not be comparable to our financial results of operations in future periods key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below

variability within upstream energy markets

we sell products and provide services to customers in upstream energy markets primarily in the united states for the upstream energy endmarket in our energy segment we manufacture pumps and associated aftermarket products and services used in drilling hydraulic fracturing and well service applications while in our industrials segment we sell dry bulk frac sand blowers which are used in hydraulic fracturing operations we refer to these products and services in the energy and industrial segments as “upstream energy” our medical segment is not exposed to the upstream energy industry

variability in the upstream energy industry can significantly impact our financial results period to period since oil prices peaked in 2014 contractions in the upstream energy industry negatively impacted our financial results in 2015 and 2016 the annual average daily closing west texas intermediate spot market crude oil prices declined from 9289 in 2014 to 4880 in 2015 and 4342 in 2016 many exploration and production companies scaled back drilling activity during this period as a result according to baker hughes inc the annual average weekly us land rig count declined from 1804 in 2014 to 943 in 2015 and 486 in 2016 and according to spears  associates inc the annual average monthly new wells drilled in the united states declined from 3857 in 2014 to 2398 in 2015 and 1093 in 2016 with these precipitous declines in exploration and production activity many oilfield service companies deferred maintenance and growth capital expenditures during 2015 and 2016

upstream energy markets stabilized late in 2016 and have continued to recover throughout 2017 positively impacting our financial results in the current year in 2017 the annual average daily closing west texas intermediate spot market crude oil price increased to 5080 as a result there has been increased exploration activity and capital expenditures by upstream energy companies according to baker hughes inc the annual average weekly us land rig count increased to 856 in 2017 compared to 486 in 2016 and according to spears  associates inc the annual average monthly new wells drilled in the united states increased to 2033 in 2017 compared to 1093 in 2016 we have experienced significant improvement in demand for our upstream energy products and services in 2017

we believe it is helpful to consider the impact of our exposure to upstream energy in evaluating our 2015 2016 and 2017 segment revenue and segment adjusted ebitda in order to better understand other drivers of our performance during those periods including operational improvements from the execution of our business transformation for the energy segment we assess the impact of our exposure to upstream energy as the portion of energy segment adjusted ebitda of the business unit serving the upstream energy market for the industrials segment we assess the impact as the standard profit on the specific upstream energy market products

restructuring and other business transformation initiatives

our top priority since the completion of the kkr transaction in 2013 has been the transformation of our business in 2014 we commenced operational excellence initiatives to streamline our cost structure and support margin expansion including through manufacturing footprint reduction selling and administrative expense efficiency and strategic sourcing in our industrials energy and medical segments

a key element of our business transformation initiatives are restructuring programs within our industrials energy and medical segments restructuring charges program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly by these business transformation initiatives under these restructuring programs we incurred restructuring charges of 53 million 329 million and 47 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in addition we incurred program related facility reorganization relocation and other costs of 53 million 87 million and 16 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we also made capital expenditures related to these programs of approximately 31 million in 2017 162 million in 2016 and 69 million in 2015 the industrials restructuring program included the closure of a business that had approximately 3 million and 9 million in revenues in 2016 and 2015 respectively these restructuring programs were completed in 2017 we generally expect that the savings associated with these restructuring programs will recover the associated costs within two to three years of such costs being incurred

acquisitions

given our global reach market leading position in our various product categories strong channel access and aftermarket presence and operational excellence competency our company provides an attractive acquisition platform in the flow control and compression equipment sectors part of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary flow control and compression equipment businesses which provide access to new technologies or geographies or improve our aftermarket offerings

 

in april 2015 we acquired a manufacturer of precision syringe pumps and related technologies for approximately 308 million creating a new automated liquid handling platform within our medical segment in august 2016 we built further upon our new automated liquid handling platform and acquired a manufacturer of highly specialized consumable microsyringes and valves that are used in liquid handling instruments in our medical segment for approximately 188 million in june 2017 within our industrials segment we acquired a leading north american manufacturer of gas compression equipment and solutions for vapor recovery biogas and other process and industrial applications for approximately 204 million inclusive of an indemnity holdback of 19 million recorded in “accrued liabilities” 

the revenues for these acquisitions subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition included in our financial results were 401 million 194 million and 134 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the operating income for these acquisitions subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition including organic growth since acquisition included in our financial results was 52 million 28 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively

sponsor management fees and expenses

through the date of our initial public offering our sponsor charged an annual management fee as well as fees and expenses for services provided these fees and charges were 173 million 48 million and 46 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in may 2017 the monitoring agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms and we paid a termination fee of approximately 162 million

stockbased compensation expense

under the terms of the 2013 stock incentive plan subsequent to the initial public offering in may 2017 the company recognized stockbased compensation expense of approximately 776 million related to timebased and performancebased stock options as of december 31 2017 there was 91 million of unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to outstanding stock options that will be recognized in future periods the company also recognized 974 million of compensation expense related to a grant of 55 million deferred stock units “dsu” to employees at the date of the initial public offering and employer taxes related to dsus of 192 million the company expects to make stockbased awards to employees and recognize stockbased compensation expenses in future periods

income taxes

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that will affect 2017 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years and 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property

the tax act also establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018 including but not limited to 1 reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate 2 elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” 3 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” a new minimum tax 4 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 5 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits “ftc” and a deduction of up to 50 to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction 8 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 9 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability and 10 limitations on net operating losses “nol” generated after december 31 2017 to 80 of taxable income

the sec staff issued sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act

for various reasons we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act if we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete we recorded provisional adjustments as described above if we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements we have not recorded any adjustments related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the tax act as we complete our accounting of the income tax effects of the tax act we anticipate that we may record additional charges or benefits at such time as prescribed by asc 740 and sab 118 and as further information becomes available regarding the tax act we may make further adjustments to the provisions that have been recorded in our financial statements we also continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business

 

the tax act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate it may be affected by other analyses related to the tax act including but not limited to our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences

the deemed repatriation transition tax “transition tax” is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits “ep” of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to determine the amount of the transition tax we must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 ep of the relevant subsidiaries the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings and the impact of the accumulated overall foreign source loss on our ability to utilize foreign tax credits we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation however we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax

our accounting for the following elements of the tax act is incomplete and we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects therefore no provisional adjustments other than the adjustment related to the effects of the transitional tax were recorded related to asc 74030

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfc” must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income

because of the complexity of the new gilti tax rules we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the tax act and the application of asc 740 under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” because whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends on not only our current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also our intent and ability to modify our structure andor our business we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the tax act

due to these complexities we have not been able to determine if our company policy concerning permanent reinvestment will change as a result of the new tax act no additional adjustments relating to asc 74030 have been recorded in accordance with sab 118 as we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the impact as of the filing of the december 31 2017 financial statements

see note 14 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

outlook

industrials segment

the missioncritical nature of our industrials products across manufacturing processes drives a demand environment and outlook that are highly correlated with global and regional industrial production capacity utilization and longterm gdp growth in the united states and europe we are poised to continue benefiting from expected growth in real gdp along with a continued rebound in industrial production activity in 2018 in apac despite the recent deceleration gdp growth remains robust in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had 3192 million of orders in our industrials segment an increase of 25 over the fourth quarter of 2016 or a 20 increase on a constant currency basis

energy segment

our energy segment has a diverse range of equipment and associated aftermarket parts consumables and services for a number of market sectors with energy exposure spanning upstream midstream downstream and petrochemical applications demand for certain of our energy products has historically corresponded to the supply and demand dynamics related to oil and natural gas products and has been influenced by oil and natural gas prices the level and intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity rig count drilling activity and other economic factors these factors have caused the level of demand for certain of our energy products to change at times both positively and negatively and we expect these trends to continue in the future in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had 2812 million of orders in our energy segment an increase of 62 over the fourth quarter of 2016 or a 58 increase on a constant currency basis

 

an increased number of drilling rigs have reentered the market as crude oil prices have improved from low points observed during the first half of 2016 and the number of drilled but uncompleted wells has grown 82 from december 2013 to december 2017 land rig count in the united states has increased 137 from 384 rigs in may 2016 to 911 rigs in december 2017 compared to a relatively flat rig count growth in the rest of the world over this same time period this trend is expected to continue as spears  associates inc projects the us land rig count to grow 12 from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 25 for the rest of the world excluding canada over this same time period we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in drilling rigs and improvements in crude oil prices in addition secular industry trends that are driving increased demand of newer fitforpurpose equipment with innovations that increase productivity and are increasing the frequency of replacement refurbishment and upgrade cycles of pumping equipment and associated consumable products used in drilling and particularly hydraulic fracturing activity by increasing the intensity of such activities as a result of our expanded direct aftermarket service locations particularly within north america we believe we are well positioned to benefit from both the increasing intensity of hydraulic fracturing activity and the increase in the backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells we expect both trends to positively impact our hydraulic fracturing and drilling product mix and our aftermarket to original equipment ratio within the energy segment

our midstream and downstream products provide relatively stable demand with attractive longterm growth trends related to an expected increase in the production and transportation of hydrocarbons demand for our petrochemical industry products correlates with growth in the development of new petrochemical plants as well as activity levels therein advancements in the development of unconventional natural gas resources in north america over the past decade have resulted in the abundant availability of locallysourced natural gas as feedstock for petrochemical plants in north america supporting longterm growth

medical segment

during 2016 we focused on the development and introduction of new products and applications to access the liquid pump market leveraging our technology and expertise in gas pumps we believe 2017 was a transition year while a large customer has elected to dual source its requirements for gas pumps we expanded into the liquid pump market and diversified our customer base for example excluding the impact of the customer that elected to dual source revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 91 compared to 2016 entering 2018 we believe that demand for products and services in the medical space will continue to benefit from attractive secular growth trends in the aging population requiring medical care emerging economies modernizing and expanding their healthcare systems and increased investment globally in health solutions in addition we expect growing demand for higher healthcare efficiency requiring premium and high performance systems in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had 668 million of orders in our medical segment an increase of 29 over the fourth quarter of 2016 or a 23 increase on a constant currency basis

 

how we assess the performance of our business

we manage operations through the three business segments described above in addition to our consolidated gaap financial measures we review various nongaap financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow

we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business adjusted ebitda represents net loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain noncash nonrecurring and other adjustment items we believe that the adjustments applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material noncash items and about nonrecurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future adjusted net income is defined as net loss including interest depreciation and amortization of nonacquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate adjusted ebitda and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions

we use free cash flow to review the liquidity of our operations we measure free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe free cash flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt free cash flow is not a measure of our liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities

management and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation such measures are provided in addition to and should not be considered to be a substitute for or superior to the comparable measures under gaap in addition we believe that adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers many of which also present adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity

adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under gaap

 

included in our discussion of our consolidated and segment results below are changes in revenues and adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda as total revenues and adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and use it to determine the constant currency revenue and adjusted ebitda growth on a yearoveryear basis constant currency revenues and adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period revenues and adjusted ebitda using corresponding prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

for further information regarding these measures see “item 6 selected financial data”

revenues

revenues for 2017 were 23754 million an increase of 4360 million or 225 compared to 19394 million in 2016 the increase in revenues was due primarily to higher revenues from upstream energy exposed markets 209 or 4055 million the favorable impact of foreign currencies 11 or 218 million improved pricing in the other markets of our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments 10 or 188 million and higher volume in our industrials segment including from acquisitions net of divestitures 01 or 16 million partially offset by lower volume including acquisitions in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our medical segment 06 or 117 million the percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 413 in 2017 compared to 347 in 2016

revenues for 2016 were 19394 million a decrease of 1875 million or 88 compared to 21269 million in 2015 the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower revenues from upstream energy exposed markets 69 or 1468 million lower volume in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments 20 or 431 million and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies especially the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar 14 or 289 million partially offset by improved pricing in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments 12 or 253 million and the impact of acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 03 or 60 million

see further analysis in the segment results below

gross profit

gross profit in 2017 was 8979 million an increase of 1812 million or 253 compared to 7167 million in 2016 and as a percentage of revenues was 378 in 2017 and 370 in 2016 the increase in gross profit reflects higher revenues from upstream energy exposed markets higher volume in our industrials segment including acquisitions and net of divestitures improved pricing in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments and the favorable impact of foreign currencies partially offset by lower volume including acquisitions in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our medical segment

gross profit in 2016 was 7167 million a decrease of 624 million or 80 compared to 7791 million in 2015 and as a percentage of revenues was 370 in 2016 and 366 in 2015 the decrease in gross profit reflects lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies partially offset by improved pricing and reduced material and other manufacturing costs

selling and administrative expenses

selling and administrative expenses were 4466 million in 2017 an increase of 323 million or 78 compared to 4143 million in 2016 the increase in selling and administrative expense in 2017 primarily reflects increased salaries and other employee related expenses and professional and consulting fees partially offset by reduced facilities operating expenses and reduced sales commissions selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to higher revenues selling and administrative expenses in 2017 includes 122 million of expenses related to our public stock offerings and establishment of public company financial reporting and 173 million of sponsor fees and expenses compared to 02 million and 48 million of sponsor fees and expenses in 2016 respectively excluding these items selling and administrative expenses were 4171 million in 2017 compared to 4093 million in 2016 and selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 176 in 2017 from 211 in 2016

selling and administrative expenses were 4143 million in 2016 a decrease of 127 million or 30 compared to 4270 million in 2015 the decrease in selling and administrative expenses primarily reflects reduced sales commissions reduced facilities operating expenses and the favorable impact of foreign currencies partially offset by increased salaries and other employeerelated expenses and professional and consultant fees selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 214 in 2016 from 201 in 2015 primarily due to lower revenues

amortization of intangible assets

amortization of intangible assets was 1189 million 1242 million and 1154 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease of 53 million in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to assets that became fully amortized in 2016 partially offset by changes in foreign currencies the increase of 88 million in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to tradenames that were determined to no longer have an indefinite useful life in the fourth quarter of 2015 and that have been amortized prospectively

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

in 2017 we recorded a noncash charge for the impairment of other intangible assets of 16 million primarily related to trademarks in our industrials segment in 2016 the company recorded a noncash charge for the impairment of other intangible assets of 253 million primarily related to trademarks in our industrials segment in 2015 we recorded noncash charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of 4214 million primarily related to the petroleum and industrial pump “pip” reporting unit of our energy segment the impairment of goodwill within the pip reporting unit resulted from the adverse impact of declining oil prices on our customer base and the corresponding demand for our products

 

other operating expense net

other operating expense net was 2221 million in 2017 an increase of 1735 million compared to 486 million in 2016 primarily due to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense for stock options and deferred stock units of 1750 million employer taxes related to deferred stock options of 192 million and increased foreign currency losses of 93 million in 2017 compared to gains of 59 million in 2016 partially offset by lower employee severance costs of 53 million in 2017 compared to 329 million in 2016 and lower environmental remediation of 09 million in 2017 compared to 56 million in 2016

other operating expense net was 486 million in 2016 an increase of 279 million compared to 207 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of 282 million compared to 329 million in 2016 and 47 million in 2015 and a charge for environmental remediation expenses of 56 million in 2016 related to a former production facility

interest expense

interest expense was 1407 million 1703 million and 1629 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease of 296 million in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to reduced debt as a result of repayments of debt with proceeds of the company’s initial public offering and a decreased weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 60 in 2017 compared to 61 in 2016 the increase of 74 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily resulted from a higher weighted average interest rate of approximately 61 in 2016 compared to 58 in 2015 due to an increase in the amount of variable rate debt swapped to fixed rates that were higher than the variable rates in the prior year

other income net

other income net was 38 million 28 million and 16 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively and consists primarily of investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments

the benefit for income taxes was 1312 million resulting in a 1163 effective tax benefit rate in 2017 compared to a benefit of 319 million resulting in a 505 effective tax benefit rate in 2016 the increase in the tax benefit and the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the tax act there was a 896 million deferred benefit associated with the rate moving from 35 to 21 in 2017 we recognized an asc 74030 liability reduction resulting in a benefit of 690 million which was partially offset by a onetime transition tax provision of approximately 633 million

the benefit for income taxes in 2016 was 319 million resulting in a 505 effective tax benefit rate in 2016 compared to a benefit of 147 million resulting in a 40 effective tax benefit rate in 2015 the increase in the tax benefit and effective rate in 2016 compared to 2015 resulted primarily from an increase in the tax benefit for losses in the us and a 166 million tax benefit relating to the reduction in deferred us tax liability for the repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings partially offset by a 116 million tax on capital gains related to legal entity reorganization in europe in 2015 the loss before income taxes in the us included a charge for the impairment of goodwill of approximately 3310 million with no corresponding tax benefit

net income loss

net income was 185 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of 313 million in 2016 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating income on higher revenues and gross profit and lower interest expense and an increase in the benefit for income taxes partially offset by higher stockbased compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt

net loss was 313 million in 2016 compared to 3520 million in 2015 the reduced net loss was primarily due to lower charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2016 lower selling and administrative expenses and the increased benefit for income taxes offset by lower gross profit on lower revenues increased other operating expense net and higher interest expense

 

adjusted ebitda

adjusted ebitda increased 1608 million to 5615 million in 2017 compared to 4007 million in 2016 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues increased 290 basis points to 236 in 2017 from 207 in 2016 the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to increased revenues in upstream energy exposed markets 1597 million improved pricing 188 million the favorable impact of foreign currencies 59 million and lower material and manufacturing costs 12 million partially offset by lower volume in other markets in our energy segment as well as in our industrials and medical segments including acquisitions and divestitures 155 million and higher selling and administrative costs 93 million

adjusted net income

adjusted net income increased 1157 million to 2493 million in 2017 compared to 1336 million in 2016 the increase was primarily due to increased adjusted ebitda and lower interest expense partially offset by an increase in the income tax provision as adjusted

adjusted net income increased 55 million to 1336 million in 2016 compared to 1281 million in 2015 the increase was primarily due to a lower income tax provision as adjusted partially offset by lower adjusted ebitda and higher interest expense depreciation expense and amortization of nonacquisition related intangible assets

 

segment results

we classify our businesses into three segments industrials energy and medical our corporate operations as described below are not discussed separately as any results that had a significant impact on operating results are included in the consolidated results discussion above

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is indicative of operational performance and ongoing profitability our management closely monitors segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate past performance and identify actions required to improve profitability

the segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are described in note 20 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

included in our discussion of our segment results below are changes in segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda on a constant currency basis constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency as changes in segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements we use these measures to determine the constant currency segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda growth on a yearonyear basis constant currency segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda are calculated by translating current period segment revenues and segment adjusted ebitda using prior period exchange rates these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources

our operations and strategic objectives require continuing investment our resources include cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and receivables financing agreement

for a description of our material indebtedness see note 10 “debt” in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

as of december 31 2017 the company had 74 million of outstanding letters of credit written against the revolving credit facility and 3526 million of unused availability the company also had 334 million of letters of credit outstanding against the receivables financing agreement and 668 million of unused availability on june 30 2017 we entered into the first amendment to the receivables financing agreement which increased the aggregated borrowing capacity by 500 million to 1250 million governed by a borrowing base and also extended the term to june 30 2020

as of december 31 2017 december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and no event of default had occurred or was ongoing

liquidity

a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service requirements and from the ongoing cost of operations working capital and capital expenditures

 

we can increase the borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facilities by up to 2500 million in the form of additional commitments under the revolving credit facility andor incremental term loans plus an additional amount so long as we do not exceed a specified senior secured leverage ratio we can incur additional secured indebtedness under the term loan facilities if certain specified conditions are met under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities our liquidity requirements are significant primarily due to debt service requirements see note 10 “debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

 

our principal sources of liquidity have been existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities and the receivables financing agreement our principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital meet debt service requirements fund capital expenditures and finance strategic plans including possible acquisitions we used the proceeds from our initial public offering in may 2017 to pay down our longterm debt by approximately 8518 million reducing our debt service requirements in the second half of 2017 we may also seek to finance capital expenditures under capital leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity or favorable borrowing terms we continue to consider acquisition opportunities but the size and timing of any future acquisitions and the related potential capital requirements cannot be predicted in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms we may obtain all or a portion of the necessary financing through the incurrence of additional longterm borrowings as market conditions warrant we and our major equity holders including our sponsor and its affiliates may from time to time seek to repurchase debt securities that we have issued or loans that we have borrowed including the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities in privately negotiated or open market transactions by tender offer or otherwise based on our current level of operations and available cash we believe our cash flow from operations together with availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations projected working capital requirements debt service requirements and capital spending requirements for the foreseeable future our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us under our revolving credit facility or the receivables financing agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs our ability to do so depends on among other factors prevailing economic conditions many of which are beyond our control in addition upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in control we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness including the senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all any future acquisitions joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

the majority of our cash is in jurisdictions outside of the united states however we believe our us operations will generate sufficient cash flows from operations along with our availability under the revolving credit facility and the receivables financing agreement to satisfy our cash needs in the united states as a result of the kkr transaction and the significant increase in our longterm debt balance as of july 30 2013 at the acquisition date we modified our assertion concerning the permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings for nonus subsidiaries in these foreign operations we intend to repatriate certain foreign earnings for the purpose of servicing our senior secured credit facilities which will result in net us tax liabilities as these foreign earnings are distributed we have previously asserted that we intend to repatriate about 200 million of accumulated earnings and while we currently have sufficient cash flows in the us as of december 31 2017 we are maintaining that assertion we are still evaluating our positon from a business perspective in light of the tax cuts and job act and have only adjusted our deferred liability for the impacts of the transitional tax our deferred income tax liability as of december 31 2017 is 93 million which consists mainly of withholding taxes no additional adjustments relating to taxation and unremitted earning have been recorded in accordance with sab 118 as we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the impact as of the filing of the december 31 2017 financial statements

working capital

 

in 2017 we revised our definition of operating working capital to accounts receivable plus inventories excluding lifo less accounts payable less advance payments on sales contracts prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation net working capital increased 2112 million to 9018 million as of december 31 2017 from 6906 million as of december 31 2016 operating working capital increased 933 million to 7050 million as of december 31 2017 from 6117 million as of december 31 2016 operating working capital at december 31 2017 as a percentage of 2017 revenues was 297 as compared to 315 at december 31 2016 as a percentage of 2016 revenues this increase was primarily due to higher accounts receivable higher inventories and lower advance payments on sales contracts partially offset by higher accounts payable the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a higher level of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the recovery in the upstream energy markets the increase in accounts receivable was also due to a difference in sales mix between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2017 a higher portion of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to highly engineered solution product contracts with higher advance payments ahead of revenue recognition than in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase in inventories was primarily due to additions to inventories in anticipation of increased demand for certain products primarily in the energy segment evidenced by increased orders in the energy segment in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 the increase in accounts payable was due to increased levels of inventories and continuing efforts to standardize vendor payment terms and timing of vendor disbursements advance payments on sales contracts was essentially flat as of december 31 2017 in comparison to 2016

 

net working capital decreased 355 million to 6906 million as of december 31 2016 from 7261 million as of december 31 2015 operating working capital decreased 380 million to 6117 million as of december 31 2016 from 6497 million as of december 31 2015 operating working capital at december 31 2016 as a percentage of 2016 revenues was 315 as compared to 305 at december 31 2015 as a percentage of 2015 revenues the decrease was primarily due to lower inventories and higher accounts payable partially offset by higher accounts receivable and lower advance payments on sales contracts during 2016 management proactively focused on reducing inventory levels while maintaining product availability and improving delivery times also centralized processes were redesigned to improve the timing of customer cash collections and to standardize vendor payment terms resulting in the improvement of accounts receivable and accounts payable performance the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of vendor cash disbursements the decrease in advance payments on sales contracts was due to a decreased level of in process engineered to order contracts at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015

offbalance sheet arrangements

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes our future minimum payments as of december 31 2017 for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to the year ended december 31 2017

 

 

 

total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 were 1018 million the total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheet line items “accrued liabilities” and “pensions and other postretirement benefits” because these liabilities are impacted by among other items plan funding levels changes in plan demographics and assumptions and investment return on plan assets it does not represent expected liquidity needs accordingly we did not include these liabilities in the “contractual obligations” table above

 

we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction we are committed to making the required minimum contributions and expect to contribute a total of approximately 01 million to our us qualified pension plans during 2018 furthermore we expect to contribute a total of approximately 03 million to our postretirement life insurance benefit plans during 2018 future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets benefit payment experience and changes if any to current funding requirements therefore no amounts were included in the “contractual obligations” table related to expected plan contributions we generally expect to fund all future contributions to our plans with cash flows from operating activities

our nonus pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations we expect to contribute a total of approximately 66 million to our nonus qualified pension plans during 2018 no amounts have been included in the “contractual obligations” table related to these plans due to the same reasons noted above

disclosure of amounts in the “contractual obligations” table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans we currently anticipate the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately 45 million to 50 million in 2018 and to remain at those levels for the next several years and the annual benefit payments for the nonus plans to be in the range of approximately 90 million to 95 million in 2018 and to gradually increase to an annual level in the range of 95 million to 115 million for the next several years

contingencies

we are a party to various legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of our size and in our sector we believe that such proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions will not materially adversely affect our operations financial condition liquidity or competitive position we have accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to include a total litigation reserve of 1056 million as of december 31 2017 with respect to potential liability arising from our asbestosrelated litigation other than our asbestosrelated litigation reserves we only have de minimis accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to other legal proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions a more detailed discussion of certain of these proceedings lawsuits and administrative actions is set forth in “item 3 legal proceedings”

critical accounting estimates

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties certain of these estimates include determining fair value all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increase in tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives

impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets

we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using data as of october 1 of that year upon adoption of asu 201704 the impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value provided the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if applicable we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss we determined fair values for each of the reporting units using a combination of the income and market multiples approaches which are weighted 75 and 25 respectively

under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate riskadjusted rate we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each business actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts discount rates used in our 2017 reporting unit valuations ranged from 99 to 113 additionally we assumed 30 terminal growth rates for all reporting units

 

under the market multiples approach fair value is determined based on multiples derived from the stock prices of publically traded guideline companies to develop a business enterprise value “bev” for our reporting units the application of the market multiples method entails the development of book value multiples based on the market value of the guideline companies the multiples are developed by first calculating the market value of equity of the guideline companies and then adjusting these multiples for cash and debt to arrive at a bev multiple identifying appropriate guideline companies and computing appropriate market multiples is subjective we considered various public companies that had reasonably similar qualitative factors as our reporting units while also considering quantitative factors such as revenue growth profitability and total assets

for all reporting units the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 833 with each reporting unit’s fair value in excess of its carrying value no goodwill impairment was recorded

 

we annually test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation referred to as the relief from royalty method we estimated forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 109 to 123 a terminal growth rate of 30 and royalty rates ranging from 30 to 40

in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets the company recorded an impairment charge of 15 million related to indefinitelived trademarks including 12 million related to two trademarks in the industrials segment and 03 million related to an indefinitelived trademark in the energy segment

we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset

also see note 8 “goodwill and other intangible assets” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

pension benefits

pension assumptions are significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions – discount rate and expected return on assets – are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and countryspecific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments we discount those cash payments using the weighted average of marketobserved yields for highquality fixedincome securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequentyear pension expense

our weighted average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations for us pension plans were 36 40 and 41 and for nonus plans were 23 23 and 33 as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the discount rate in both the united states and the united kingdom was determined by projecting the plans’ expected future benefit payments discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zerocoupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of highquality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that results in the same projected benefit obligation in all other countries the discount rate was based on appropriate published indices with recognition of the plan liability durations

to determine the expected weighted average longterm rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and target asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets in developing future longterm return expectations for our principal benefit plans’ assets we formulate views on the future economic environment both in the united states and abroad we evaluate general market trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth inflation valuations yields and spreads using both internal and external sources we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given current and target allocations based on our analysis of future expectations of asset performance past return results and our current and target asset allocations for cost recognition in 2018 we have assumed a longterm expected return on assets of 775 for us plans and 50 for nonus plans

 

the table below illustrates the sensitivity of the significant pension assumptions on a combined basis for the company’s us and nonus plans

 

income taxes

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that will affect 2017 including but not limited to 1 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years 2 bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property and 3 a change in us deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to the us tax rate reduction from 35 to 21

the tax act also establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018 including but not limited to 1 reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate 2 elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” 3 the creation of the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” a new minimum tax 4 a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 5 a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits “ftc” and a deduction of up to 50 to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 6 a new limitation on deductible interest expense 7 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction 8 limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 9 limitations on the use of ftcs to reduce the us income tax liability and 10 limitations on net operating losses “nol” generated after december 31 2017 to 80 of taxable income

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the act for which the accounting under fasb accounting standard codification 740 “asc 740” is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act

for various reasons we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act if we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of elements for which our analysis is not yet complete we recorded provisional adjustments as described above if we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements we have not recorded any adjustments related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the tax act as we complete our accounting of the income tax effects of the tax act we anticipate that we may record additional charges or benefits at such time as prescribed by asc 740 and sab 118 and as further information becomes available regarding the tax act we may make further adjustments to the provisions that have been recorded in our financial statements we also continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business

the tax act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate it may be affected by other analyses related to the tax act including but not limited to our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences

the deemed repatriation transition tax “transition tax” is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ep of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to determine the amount of the transition tax we must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 ep of the relevant subsidiaries the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings and the impact of the accumulated overall foreign source loss on our ability to utilize foreign tax credits we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax obligation however we are continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the transition tax

 

our accounting for the following elements of the tax act is incomplete and we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects therefore no provisional adjustments other than the adjustment related to the effects of the transitional tax were recorded related to asc 74030 formerly accounting principles board 23

 

the tax act creates a new requirement that certain income ie gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations “cfc” must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc with respect to which it is a us shareholder over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income

because of the complexity of the new gilti tax rules we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the tax act and the application of asc 740 under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” because whether we expect to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends on not only our current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also our intent and ability to modify our structure andor our business we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the tax act

due to these complexities we have not been able to determine if our company policy concerning permanent reinvestment will change as a result of the new tax act no additional adjustments relating to asc 74030 have been recorded in accordance with sab 118 as we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the impact as of the filing of the december 31 2017 financial statements

stock compensation

we account for stockbased compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all stockbased payments to employees and nonemployees including grants of stock options and deferred stock units “dsu” to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards

the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the blackscholesmerton valuation model the model requires certain assumptions including the estimated expected term of the stock options the riskfree interest rate and the exercise price of which certain assumptions are highly complex and subjective the expected option life represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding based on managements best estimate of the timing of a liquidity event and the contractual term of the stock option as there is not sufficient trading history of our common stock we use a group of our competitors which we believe are similar to us adjusted for our capital structure in order to estimate volatility our exercise price is the stock price on the date in which shares were granted

concurrent with the company’s initial public offering in may of 2017 the company’s board authorized the grant of 55 million dsus to all permanent employees that had not previously received stockbased awards under the 2013 plan the dsus vested immediately upon grant however contain restrictions such that the employee may not sell or otherwise realize the economic benefits of the award until certain dates through april 2019 the fair value of each dsu grant under the stockbased compensation plan is estimated on the date of grant or modification using the finnerty discount for lack of marketability pricing model the discount for lack of marketability is commensurate with the period of sale restrictions related to the company’s initial public offering

prior to our initial public offering our stock price was calculated based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method forecasted cash flows are discounted to the present value at a riskadjusted discount rate the valuation analyses determine discrete free cash flows over several years based on forecast financial information provided by management and a terminal value for the residual period beyond the discrete forecast which are discounted at an appropriate rate to estimate the companys enterprise value under the market approach specifically the guideline public company method we select publicly traded companies with similar financial and operating characteristics as the company and calculate valuation multiples based on the guideline public company’s financial information and market data subsequent to the initial public offering the estimation of our stock price is no longer be necessary as we rely on the market price to determine the market value of our common stock for additional information related to the assumptions used see note 15 “stockbased compensation plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

loss contingencies

loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to asbestos and silica related litigation environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments

 

when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood liabilities are based on the lowend of such range however the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made disclosure is provided

disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made as discussed above development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties such as regulatory agencies the court system and other interested parties such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variablerate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable debt and from time to time use payfixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative fixed and variable portions

as of december 31 2017 we had variable rate debt outstanding of 8932 million at a current weighted average interest rate of 39 substantially all of which was incurred under our 27850 million senior secured credit facility under which 12823 million was outstanding under the 12855 million dollar term loan facility and €6135 million was outstanding under the €6150 million euro term loan facility

the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility bear interest primarily based on libor and euribor respectively plus a spread however both facilities are subject to a 0 libor base rate floor and thus the interest rate on the dollar term loan facility and the euro term loan facility will fluctuate when libor or euribor respectively exceeds that percentage as of december 31 2017 libor was higher and euribor was lower than the 0 libor minimum rate

we use interest rate swaps to offset our exposure to interest rate movements these outstanding interest rate swaps qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted liborbased interest payments as of december 31 2017 we were a fixed rate payer on 12 fixedfloating interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the liborbased index used to determine the interest rates charged on our liborbased variable rate borrowings see note 16 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the following table presents the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the yield curve by 100 basis points including the effect of our interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 on our interest expense

 

 

 

 

foreign currency risk

we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from our global business operations changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency in 2017 the relative weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while in 2016 the relative strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our revenues and results of operations while future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies

we seek to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risks through a combination of normal operating activities including by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies to match expenses with revenues and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and net investment crosscurrency interest rate swaps in addition to mitigate the risk arising from entering into transactions in currencies other than our functional currencies we typically settle intercompany trading balances monthly

the table below presents the percentage of revenues and gross profit by principal currency for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016

 

we utilize foreign currency denominated debt obligations supplemented from time to time with cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in nonus subsidiaries the currency effects of the designated debt obligations and cross currency interest rate swaps are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income within our stockholders’ equity where they partially offset the currency translation effects of our investments in nonus subsidiaries which in turn partially offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally these currency translation effects and offsetting impacts of our derivatives for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 are summarized in note 13 “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk arising from transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries our foreign currency forward contracts are typically shortterm and are rolled forward as necessary upon settlement as of december 31 2017 we were party to 12 foreign currency forward contracts all of which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value see note 16 “hedging activities derivative instruments and credit risk” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

compensation discussion and analysis

introduction

this section describes our compensation philosophy and details the compensation programs that cover our named executive officers “neos”

our neos for 2017 are

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive compensation objectives and philosophy

our executive compensation philosophy is designed to attract and retain individuals with the qualifications to meet the company’s strategic objectives and create value for our shareholders we believe that the best way to align our executives with our objectives and create shareholder value is to emphasize two key compensation principles 1 significant equity participation and 2 payforperformance

in february 2018 following an evaluation with the assistance of pearl meyer of equitybased incentives for our executive officers the compensation committee adopted a new longterm equity incentive program the “2018 lti program” under the 2018 lti program our neos will receive annual equity awards 50 of which will be in the form of timevesting restricted stock and 50 of which will be in the form of timevesting stock options the following charts illustrate our focus on equity participation by showing that 72 of our ceo’s expected 2018 target base salary annual incentive and longterm equity incentive compensation mix and 49 of our other neos’ expected 2018 mix is based on longterm equity incentives see “compensation actions taken in 2018―longterm incentive compensation” 

our commitment to aligning the interests of our executives to the interests of our shareholders through equity participation is further evidenced by the fact that in 2017 we adopted what we believe is a marketleading stock ownership and retention policy for our executives and nonemployee directors that combines robust stock ownership requirements with retention requirements see “stock ownership and retention policy” below all of our neos maintain a significant equity stake in the company and currently exceed their respective ownership requirements through ownership of vested and exercisable stock options andor direct investments in our common stock

 

in addition to equity participation we strongly believe in a payforperformance culture this is evidenced by the fact that our annual cash incentive program is 100 based on the financial performance of the company and its business units and that it accounts for 50 of the expected total cash compensation of our ceo and on average 41 for our other neos in each case when paid out at target when paid out at the maximum payout capped at 200 of target this percentage increases to 67 and 58 respectively also our execut ives receive no payout for below threshold performance and we believe that our threshold at 95 of target is more challenging than typical market practice see “―executive compensation program elements―cash bonus opportunities―annual cash bonus opportunity ” even more importantly when our shortterm cash incentive is combined with our long term equity incentive it results in 84 of our ceo’s and 70 of our neos’ compensation being variable performance compensation

in addition to equity compensation and our annual cash incentive opportunity we provide neos a combination of the following other compensation components

 

 

 

in 2017 we did not make any equity grants to our neos believing that the equ ity grants made in prior years were sufficiently retentive and fostered the necessary level of alignment with shareholder interests see “―executive compensation program elements―longterm equity incentive awards”

strong compensation governance practices and policies

within the context of the compensation philosophy and the company’s business objectives the compensation committee engages in an ongoing review of the company’s executive compensation programs in connection with this review the compensation committee has adopted the following practices and policies reflecting what it believes to be a best practices approach to executive compensation

compensation determination process and compensation consultant independence

prior to our initial public offering our compensation committee historically made all executive compensation decisions including determinations as to the compensation of our neos from the date of our initial public offering the compensation committee has been responsible for determining the compensation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and other executive officers and approving or recommending such compensation to the board of directors because of his daily involvement with the executive team our ceo makes recommendations to the compensation committee regarding compensation for the executive officers other than himself no member of management participates in discussions with the compensation committee regarding his or her own compensation

in connection with our initial public offering we engaged pearl meyer  partners llc “pearl meyer” a compensation consulting firm to assist us in evaluating the elements and levels of our executive compensation including base salaries annual cash incentive awards and equitybased incentives for our executive officers in february 2018 the compensation committee determined that pearl meyer is independent from management and that pearl meyer’s work has not raised any conflicts of interest

 

the compensation committee did not benchmark 2017 compensation against a peer group however over the course of the second half of 2017 and early 2018 pearl meyer developed a compensation peer group conducted a competitive market assessment and developed recommendations for the 2018 lti pro gram see “compensation actions taken in 2018―longterm incentive compensation”

base salary is the only fixed component of the company’s neos’ cash compensation an neo’s base salary is related to the individual’s level of responsibility and provides them with a level of cash income predictability and stability with respect to a portion of their total compensation the compensation committee believes that base salaries for executives should reflect competitive levels of pay and factors unique to each executive such as experience and breadth of responsibilities performance individual skill set time in the role and internal pay parity base salaries are reviewed annually or at other times when appropriate and may be increased from time to time pursuant to such review in connection with our annual review we determined to increase the base salaries of each of our neos by not more than 3 based on their performance in 2016 effective april 2017 mr miñarro viseras is based in germany and compensated in euros accordingly his salary increase was based on his salary in euros the following table reflects the base salaries of our neos as of december 31 2017

 

 

 

cash bonus opportunities

annual cash bonus opportunity 

in order to tie a portion of their cash compensation to actual performance each neo is eligible for an annual cash bonus award under our management incentive plan  “ mip ”  based on the achievement of our financial goals for the company and their respective business units

a target annual bonus expressed as a percentage of an neo ’ s base salary in effect at yearend is established within certain neos ’ offer letters and employment agreements and may be adjusted from time to time by the compensation committee in connection with an neo ’ s promotion or performance the target annual bonus for 2017 for messrs reynal and herndon was 100 of their respective base salaries for mr schiesl was 75 of his base salary for mr snyder was 50 of his base salary and for mr mi ñ arro viseras was 45 of his base salary

we generally believe that tying our corporate level neos ’ bonuses to companywide performance goals encourages those neos to focus on companywide priorities and that tying the bonuses of our neos at the business segment and business unit level to business segment goals and business unit goals respectively rewards these neos for achievements with respect to their business segments and units in 2017 the compensation committee decided to base mip awards for messrs reynal herndon and snyder in part on the performance of our industrials segment because each serves in roles at both the corporate level and the industrials segment level and the compensation committee wanted them to continue to focus on the objectives of the industrials segment since it typically accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue a detailed description of the 2017 mip metrics and the calculation of the actual amounts paid to each of our neos are provided below

we chose to use adjusted ebitda as that term is defined elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k because we believe that it provides a reliable indicator of our strategic growth and the strength of our overall financial results

 

actual amounts paid to messrs reynal herndon and snyder under the 2017 mip were calculated by multiplying their target annual bonus for 2017 by the sum of 1 75 multiplied by the weighted average of the payout percentages associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda targets for the mip business units as defined below and 2 25 multiplied by the payout percentage associated with our achievement against the industrials segment adjusted ebitda target the “mip business units” include energy pip energy nashgaro energy emco industrials americas industrials emea industrials apac and medical the weighting for each mip business unit is determined by dividing fiscal 2017 adjusted ebitda budget for each business unit by the sum of fiscal 2017 adjusted ebitda budgets for all the mip business units to calculate the composite payout percentage for all mip business units each mip business unit’s corresponding weighting is multiplied by the payout percentage associated with actual 2017 adjusted ebitda achievement against that business unit’s respective adjusted ebitda budget and the resulting amounts are summed

we believe adjusted ebitda targets set for the mip business units in 2017 provided reasonably achievable but challenging goals for our neos and the other mip participants at the corporate level in addition we believe the industrials segment adjusted ebitda target set in 2017 provided reasonably achievable but challenging goals for our neos and other mip participants in the industrials segment

actual amounts paid to mr schiesl under the 2017 mip were calculated by multiplying his target annual bonus for 2017 by the weighted average of the payout percentages associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda targets for the mip business units

for our neo at the business unit level mr mi ñ arro viseras the mip award is tied to the financial results of his business segment and his business unit measured by adjusted ebitda the actual amount paid to mr mi ñ arro viseras under the 2017 mip was calculated by multiplying his target annual bonus for 2017 by the sum of 1 50 multiplied by the payout percentage associated with our achievement against the industrials segment adjusted ebitda target and 2 50 multiplied by the payout percentage associated with our achievement against the industrials emea adjusted ebitda target we believe the industrials emea adjusted ebitda target set in 2017 provided a reasonably achievable but challenging goal for mr mi ñ arro viseras and other mip participants at our industrials emea business unit

the adjusted ebitda payout percentage for each of our segments and business units was determined by calculating actual achievement against the adjusted ebitda performance targets based on the preestablished scale set forth in the table below

 

no cash incentive award would have been paid to our neos whose awards were based partially or entirely on the performance of our mip business units unless actual performance for fiscal 2017 for at least one of the mip business units was at or above 95 of the applicable adjusted ebitda target or in the case of mr mi ñ arro viseras if the performance of our industrials segment for 2017 was at or above the adjusted ebitda target for our industrials segment adjusted ebitda results are adjusted to the extent that actual foreign exchange rates by country differ by more than 5 of budgeted foreign exchange rates for performance percentages between the levels set forth above the resulting payout percentage is adjusted on a linear basis in addition to setting adjusted ebitda targets for our business units we set an annual corporate expense budget each year and any difference between actual and budgeted corporate expense is allocated to the adjusted ebitda at our business units at the discretion of the compensation committee while there are no individual goals for purposes of mip award payments the compensation committee on the recommendation of mr reynal may adjust an incentive payment upward or downward for performancerelated reasons in addition the compensation committee has discretion to adjust mip award payments for unanticipated events for 2017 the compensation committee did not make any discretionary adjustments to the calculated mip award payments

 

the following table sets forth our actual payout percentage achieved with respect to each performance metric applicable to our neos and illustrates the calculation of the annual cash incentive awards payable to our neos under the 2017 mip in light of these performance results

 

 

1   represents the weighted average of the payout percentages associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda targets for the mip business units 

2 messrs reynal’s herndon’s and snyder’s 2017 mip opportunities were based 75 on the weighted average of the payout percentages associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda targets for the mip business units and 25 on the payout percentage associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda target for the industrials segment

3 mr miñarro viseras’s 2017 mip opportunity was based 50 on the payout percentage associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda target for the industrials segment and 50 on the payout percentage associated with our achievement against the adjusted ebitda target for the industrials emea business unit

ipo bonuses 

for their extraordinary efforts in 2017 in connection with our initial public offering the compensation committee in february 2018 determined to award each of messrs reynal herndon schiesl and snyder a onetime discretionary ipo bonus the ipo bonuses were awarded in the following amounts mr reynal  225000 mr herndon  125000 mr schiesl  100000 and mr snyder  75000

signon bonuses 

from time to time we may award signon bonuses in connection with the commencement of an neo ’ s employment with us signon bonuses are used only when necessary to attract highly skilled officers to the company generally they are used to provide an incentive to candidates to leave their current employers or may be used to offset the loss of unvested compensation that they may forfeit as a result of leaving their current employers signon bonuses are typically subject to a clawback obligation if the officer voluntarily terminates his or her employment with us prior to the first anniversary of the employment commencement date we did not award any signon bonuses to our neos in 2017

longterm equity incentive awards

prior to our initial public offering we granted longterm equitybased awards to our executives that were designed to align executives ’ and shareholders ’ interests promote performance through a broad ownership mindset incentivize our executives to remain in our service and align the interests of our executives with those of our ultimate equity holders the awards we granted to our neos under our longterm incentive program our “ longterm incentive program ”  were in the form of stock options with 50 of each award vesting based on timebased vesting conditions  “ time options ”  and 50 of each award vesting based on performancebased vesting conditions  “ performance options ”  the stock options generally vest if at all ratably over a three to fiveyear period subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date and in the case of the performance options achievement of the applicable performance criteria see “ narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards in 2017 ― terms of equity awards ― longterm incentive plan grants ” the compensation committee determined that granting our neos stock options would meet our goals of fostering a culture of performance and commitment to our company stock options serve as components of performancebased compensation because they only provide value to our neos if the value of our stock appreciates all equitybased awards under our longterm incentive program were granted under the 2013 stock incentive plan

in addition to granting them longterm equitybased awards we have given our executive officers the opportunity to and in some cases in connection with the commencement of their employment with us have required them to make meaningful investments in our common stock subject to satisfaction of applicable securities law requirements see “ narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards in 2017 ― summary of neo offer letters and employment agreements ” 

 

in connection with our initial public off ering we adopted a new incentive plan the gardner denver holdings inc 2017 stock incentive plan pursuant to which we will grant our future longterm equity incentive awards see “compensation actions taken in 2018―longterm incentive compensation” bel ow 

benefits and perquisites

while our compensation philosophy is to focus on performancebased forms of compensation while providing only minimal executive benefits and perquisites we provide to all of our employees including our neos broadbased employee benefits that are intended to attract and retain employees while providing them with retirement and health and welfare security these include

 

 

 

401k plan 

our us eligible employees including our neos participate in the gardner denver inc retirement savings plan the “ 401k plan ”  which is a taxqualified retirement savings plan for employees hired after january 1 2014 enrollment in the 401k plan is automatic for employees who meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation under the 401k plan we match 100 of the first 6 of a participant ’ s salary contributions to the 401k plan participants are 100 vested in employee and matching contributions the maximum contribution to the 401k plan is 100 of an employees annual eligible compensation subject to regulatory and plan limitations

supplemental excess defined contribution plan 

in addition to the 401k plan us employees with a salary grade of 20 or higher generally senior managers and above including the neos other than mr mi ñ arro viseras are eligible to participate in the gardner denver inc supplemental excess defined contribution plan the “ excess contribution plan ”  which is funded through a rabbi trust this plan provides participants with a similar level of benefits afforded to all other eligible employees who are not subject to the limitations imposed by the irs on our taxqualified 401k plan

eligible employees may contribute to the excess contribution plan when they exceed the annual irs pretax contribution limits and the annual catchup contribution limit for participants age 50 or over under the excess contribution plan we match 100 of the first 6 of a participant ’ s salary contributions to the excess contribution plan company matching contributions under the excess contribution plan are contributed in the form of cash rather than our common stock all employee and company matching contributions are fully vested immediately

limited perquisites 

executive perquisites are not part of our general compensation philosophy however we provide limited perquisites and personal benefits that are not generally available to all employees when necessary to attract top talent these are typically set forth in the offer letters or employment agreements we enter into with our executive officers see “ narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards in 2017 ― summary of neo offer letters and employment agreements” for example in 2017 per his employment agreement mr mi ñ arro viseras was entitled to international school assistance and use of a company car mr snyder was also provided with a housing allowance in addition from time to time we provide tax grossups on perquisites we provide in order to allow our neos to enjoy the full benefit of the perquisite we are providing

severance and change in control agreements

the company believes that reasonable and appropriate severance and change in control benefits are necessary in order to be competitive in the company ’ s executive attraction and retention efforts as discussed above the offer letters we enter into with our neos provide for certain payments rights and benefits to the neos upon an involuntary termination of employment without cause as defined in “ potential payments to named executive officers upon termination of employment or change in controlseverance arrangements and restrictive covenants ” below from the company or a termination by the neo for good reason as defined in “ potential payments to named executive officers upon termination of employment or change in controlseverance arrangements and restrictive covenants ” below in addition our equity award agreements provide for accelerated vesting upon a change in control in certain circumstances as more fully described above under “― narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards in 2017 ― terms of equity awards ” 

 

employment agreements

we do not typically enter into employment agreements with our neos however we entered into an employment agreement and offer letter with mr mi ñ arro viseras and offer letters setting forth initial compensation and benefits as well as severance terms with each of our other neos full descriptions of the material terms of the employment agreement and offer letter we entered into with mr mi ñ arro viseras and the offer letters we entered into with messrs reynal herndon schiesl and snyder are presented below in “― narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of planbased awards in 2017 ” 

risk management

the compensation committee conducts a thorough review of all incentive programs and confirms that our executives are not incented to focus on shortterm stock performance or take excessive risk in managing the business in particular longterm incentive awards as a significant portion of total direct compensation and robust stock holding requirements are structured to align management with the longterm health of the business

stock ownership and retention policy

to align the interests of our management and directors with those of our stockholders the board of directors concluded that certain of our executive officers the “covered executives” and directors should have a significant financial stake in the company’s stock to further that goal we implemented stock ownership guidelines in 2017 the “guidelines” the covered executives will be required to hold a specific level of equity ownership as outlined below

executives  the guidelines will apply to the covered executives in the following tiers

 

covered executives’ stock ownership multiples  the stock ownership levels under the guidelines expressed as a multiple of the covered executive’s base annual salary rate as of january 1 st of the year are as follows

 

retention requirement  there is no required time period within which a covered executive must attain the applicable stock ownership level under the guidelines however until the applicable ownership level is achieved covered executives must retain 75 of net shares granted to them once the ownership guideline is met covered executives must retain 30 of net shares granted to them however this requirement drops to 20 for a covered executive upon the earlier of a 1 such covered executive reaching the age of 55 and 2 such covered executive achieving 10 years of service with the company and terminates upon the earlier of 1 such covered executive reaching the age of 60 and 2 such covered executive achieving 15 years of service with the company

the shares counted toward these ownership requirements includes shares owned outright and vested stock options the retention requirement applies to all prior and future grants

these ownership requirements are set at levels that the company believes are robust given the covered executives’ respective salaries and responsibilities

directors  our directors are required to hold 75 of net shares granted to them under our benefit plans until they own equity equal to five times their annual cash retainers once the ownership guideline is met directors must retain 30 of the net shares granted to them under our benefit plans until their retirement

as of january 1 2018 all of our neos and then serving directors were in compliance with the applicable stock ownership levels under the guidelines

 

hedging and pledging policies

the company’s securities trading policy requires executive officers and directors to consult the company’s general counsel prior to engaging in transactions involving the company’s securities the company’s securities trading policy prohibits directors and executive officers from hedging or monetization transactions including but not limited to through the use of financial instruments such as exchange funds variable forward contracts equity swaps puts calls and other derivative instruments or through the establishment of a short position in the company’s securities the company’s securities trading policy limits the pledging of company securities to those situations approved by the company’s general counsel

section 162m of the internal revenue code

we expect to be able to claim the benefit of a special exemption rule that applies to compensation paid or compensation in respect of equity awards such as stock options granted during a specified transition period following our initial public offering this transition period was previously anticipated to potentially extend until our first annual stockholders meeting that occurs in 2021 pursuant to regulations under the section 162m of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” however the recently enacted tax cut and jobs act amended section 162m of the code in several respects including the elimination the “performancebased compensation” exception under section 162m of the code for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 pending further guidance under section 162m of the code it is unclear whether the postipo transition period exception under section 162m will continue to apply to us for compensation paid or awards granted in 2018 or beyond once applicable guidance is released we expect the compensation committee to consider the implications of section 162m and such guidance in its future compensation decisions

compensation actions taken in 2018

longterm incentive compensation

in february 2018 following an evaluation with the assistance of pearl meyer of the equitybased incentives for our executive officers the compensation committee adopted the 2018 lti program under the 2018 lti program our neos will receive annual equity awards 50 of which will be in the form of timevesting restricted stock and 50 of which will be in the form of timevesting stock options the timevesting restricted stock awards and the timevesting options awards under the 2018 lti program will vest in equal annual installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date except that the awards granted in 2018 will vest in equal annual installments on each of the second third fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date the compensation committee determined that in 2018 awards under the 2018 lti program will be made to our neos in the following am ounts mr reynal ― 4000000 mr herndon ― 1000000 mr schiesl ― 675000 mr snyder ― 400000 mr mi ñarro viseras ― 500000 these grant amounts will be translated into a number of stock options and shares of restricted stock by taking such dol lar amount and dividing it by the per share or per option “fair value” that will be used for reporting the compensation expense associated with the grant under applicable accounting guidance which “fair value” will be based in part on the per share closing price of our common stock on the nyse on the date of grant

executive severance benefits – mr snyder and mr miñarro viseras

in february 2018 in connection with our annual review of our executive compensation we approved an increase to the benefits to which messrs snyder and miñarro viseras are entitled in the event of certain qualifying terminations to align them with the severance benefits to which our other senior executive officers are entitled

under the terms approved by the compensation committee in february 2018 if the company terminates mr snyder’s employment without cause as that term is defined below under “potential payments to named executive officers upon termination of employment or change in control―severance arrangements and restrictive covenants” or if mr snyder terminates his employment with us for good reason as that term is defined below under “potential payments to named executive officers upon termination of employment or change in control―severance arrangements and restrictive cove nants” subject to mr snyder’s continued compliance with the restrictive covenants in his management equity agreements and his execution of a customary waiver and release agreement he will be entitled to receive

performance option vesting schedule  we granted performance options in may 2016 to messrs reynal herndon snyder and miñarro viseras and in december 2016 to messrs herndon and snyder the performance options granted in may 2016 to messrs reynal herndon and snyder are eligible to vest and become exercisable with respect to up to 333 of such performance options on december 31st of each of 2016 2017 and 2018 and the performance options granted in may 2016 and december 2016 to mr miñarro viseras and messrs herndon and snyder respectively are eligible to vest and become exercisable with respect to up to 20 of such performance options on december 31st of each of 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date if and only to the extent that the company achieves the annual adjusted ebitda performance targets set by the compensation committee where “adjusted ebitda” refers to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus transaction management andor similar fees paid to kkr andor its affiliates provided that the board may following consultation with the ceo adjust the calculation of adjusted ebitda to reflect to the extent not contemplated in the management plan any extraordinary or onetime events including without limitation acquisitions divestitures major capital investment programs changes in accounting standards stock expense related to the issuance of stock options or other extraordinary or unusual events or occurrences or any costs or expenses incurred during such period relating to environmental remediation litigation or other disputes in respect of events and exposures that occurred prior to the end of the relevant fiscal year

we also granted performance options to mr schiesl in 2014 and to mr reynal in 2015 the performance options granted to mr schiesl in 2014 were eligible to vest and become exercisable with respect to up to 20 of such performance options on december 31st of each of 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date if and only to the extent that the company achieves the annual adjusted ebitda performance targets set by the compensation committee the performance options granted to mr reynal in 2015 were eligible to vest and become exercisable with respect to up to 333 of such performance options on december 31st of each of 2016 2017 and 2018 subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date if and only to the extent that the company achieves the annual adjusted ebitda performance targets set by the compensation committee

the fiscal 2017 adjusted ebitda performance target for purposes of determining vesting of performance options was 470 million and our actual adjusted ebitda performance for fiscal 2017 was 5615 million therefore 333 of the performance options granted in may 2016 to messrs reynal herndon and snyder and to mr reynal in 2015 and 20 of the performance options granted in may 2016 to mr miñarro viseras in december 2016 to messrs herndon and snyder and to mr schiesl in 2014 vested on december 31 2017

if the company does not achieve the adjusted ebitda performance target in 2018 but the company’s adjusted ebitda in respect of fiscal year 2018 equals or exceeds the adjusted ebitda performance threshold set by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2018 then onequarter 14 of the performance options granted in 2016 to our neos in other than mr miñarro viseras eligible to vest on december 31st of such year shall vest on december 31st of such year and with respect to the remaining threequarters 34 of the performance options eligible to vest on december 31st of such year onehalf 12 of such performance options shall vest on december 31 2019 if the company’s adjusted ebitda in respect of fiscal year 2019 equals or exceeds the adjusted ebitda target set by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2019 and onehalf 12 of such performance options shall vest on december 31 2020 if the company’s adjusted ebitda in respect of fiscal year 2020 equals or exceeds the adjusted ebitda target set by the compensation committee for fiscal year 2020

at the end of the yearly measurement period with respect to any award of performance options any then outstanding performance options that were not vested and exercisable in any previous year in accordance with their terms shall become vested and exercisable to the extent that the cumulative performance objectives have been satisfied in respect of the applicable performance period

 

we believe that the adjusted ebitda performance targets in all periods provide reasonably achievable but challenging goals for our neos and other longterm incentive program participants and are intended to incentivize all participants to maximize their performance for the longterm benefit of our stockholders

under the management stockholder’s agreement shares of our common stock beneficially owned by our neos are generally nontransferable prior to the earlier of i a change in control or ii the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the applicable management stockholder’s agreement

 

our neos have limited “piggyback” registration rights with respect to shares of our common stock provided that in lieu of piggyback rights where such rights would otherwise be available our board of directors in its sole discretion may elect to waive the transfer restrictions other than any such restrictions contained in an underwriters’ lockup or in connection with a public offering on the number of shares of common stock that would have been subject to such piggyback rights

pursuant to the terms of the management stockholder’s agreement the neos are subject to covenants not to 1 disclose confidential information 2 solicit customers and certain employees consultants and independent contractors of the company 3 compete with the company and 4 disparage the company

 

outstanding equity awards at 2017 fiscal year end

 

 

 

 

option exercises and stock vested in 2017

during 2017 none of our neos exercised options or had any shares of stock or restricted stock or restricted stock units or similar instruments vest

 

pension benefits  fiscal 2017

during 2017 no neos participated in either a taxqualified or nonqualified defined benefit plan sponsored by the company

nonqualified deferred compensation  fiscal 2017

 

 

 

 

 

nonqualified deferred compensation plan

in addition to the 401k plan us employees with a salary grade of 20 or higher generally senior managers and above are eligible to participate in the excess contribution plan once a participant in the excess contribution plan reaches the irs annual limits for the 401k plan contributions will be made to the excess contribution plan based on the deferral percentage under the 401k plan such deferral percentage is selected at the time of enrollment in the excess contribution plan or once per year in december for the following year a separate election to defer from the annual mip awards is made in december for the mip award earned the following year and payable in the year thereafter the company matches each participant’s contributions with company matching contributions the company match consists of 1 for each 1 contributed by a participant up to the first 6 of a participant’s annual compensation the company match is credited in the form of cash

historically the neos were also credited with a nonelective company contribution of 12 of recognized compensation in excess of the irs annual limit the company nonelective contributions were also contributed in cash and became fully vested after three years of employment we discontinued the nonelective company contributions in 2014

mr schiesl is fully vested in the nonelective company contribution portion of the excess contribution plan and messrs reynal and herndon joined the company after the nonelective contribution had been discontinued

participants in the excess contribution plan may elect to receive distributions in either x a lump sum to be paid on the march 1 of the calendar year following the year of separation from the company or y in a lump sum to be paid within 90 days after separation from service subject to the terms and conditions of the excess contribution plan loans and inservice withdrawals are not permitted under the excess contribution plan

the investment options available to the named executive officers under the excess contribution plan are virtually the same as those offered to all of the participants in the 401k plan because some investment options available under the 401k plan are not available for the nonqualified plan the company has made similar investment options available to the nonqualified plan participants the table below shows the funds available under the excess contribution plan and their annual rate of return for the calendar year ended december 31 2017 as reported by the administrator of the 401k plan

notwithstanding the foregoing any event described in clauses 1 or 2 above must be an event that would result in a material negative change in the executive’s employment relationship with the company and thus effectively constitute an involuntary termination of employment for purposes of section 409a of the code
