we own many patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality the us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments do not experience significant seasonality as demand for our products is generally consistent throughout the year 

customers sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 34 percent of net sales in 2022 and 32 percent of net sales in both 2021 and 2020 these sales are primarily included in our us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales for any year 

during 2022 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

government business no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition we are the branded market leader in the coffee dog snacks peanut butter and fruit spreads categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the pickles flour fruit spreads canned milk and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the growth of certain retail channels such as the 

ecommerce market the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store however there has been a recent increase in sales primarily driven by changes in consumer behaviors including employees working at home more frequently as a result of the pandemic certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the longerterm decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty in our total us retail categories private label held a 115 dollar average market share during the 52 weeks ended april 17 2022 as compared to a 122 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

our primary brands and major competitors as of april 30 2022 are listed below

 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report although the risks are organized and described separately many of the risks are interrelated additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our business 

the covid19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business and industry as a result of changes in consumer behaviors retailer inventory levels cost inflation manufacturing and supply chain disruption vaccination rates and effectiveness the impact of vaccination requirements and overall macroeconomic conditions while our overall business has benefited from increased athome consumption due to covid19 our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on evolving consumer mobility and purchasing behavior though the vaccination requirements and effectiveness may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of covid19 the related ongoing implications of the pandemic could negatively impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to the following 

• a shutdown or slowdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities due to illness or labor shortages could significantly disrupt our production capabilities particularly with respect to our coffee production substantially all of which takes place in new orleans louisiana 

• a slowdown or stoppage in our supply chain could result from government restrictions or labor shortages due to illness or vaccination requirements or if our suppliers vendors distributors or thirdparty manufacturers fail to meet their obligations to us or experience disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of illness or government restrictions or the attention of our management team could be diverted if any key employees become ill from covid19 and are unable to work 

• a strain on our supply chain could result from increased consumer demand at our retail and ecommerce customers 

• an increase in commodity and other input costs could result from market volatility particularly with respect to protein meals fats corn products and green coffee the supply chain for which has been significantly disrupted by covid19 

• an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill other intangible assets or other longlived assets or a change in the useful life of finitelived intangible assets could occur if there are sustained changes in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions 

• a decrease in demand for away from home establishments resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures may adversely affect our away from home operations 

• an increase in working capital needs could occur caused by an increase in days sales outstanding or an extension of payment terms by our customers or a reduction of payment terms by our suppliers resulting from increased financial pressures 

• a change in demand resulting from restrictions on social interactions could affect customers’ and consumers’ plans to purchase or methods of purchasing our products 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products could result from retailers distributors or carriers modifying their restocking fulfillment or shipping practices 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or competitive products or our lowerpriced products 

• a change in trade promotions and marketing activities could occur in response to changes in consumer viewing and shopping habits resulting from the cancellation of major events travel restrictions and changes in instore shopping practices 

• a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates or inflation could result from market uncertainties 

• an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities and 

• an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to implement price increases resulting from commodity or other input cost increases or to execute strategic business activities including acquisitions and divestitures 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could also heighten many of the other risk factors discussed in this section overall the impact of covid19 remains uncertain and ultimately depends on the length and severity of the pandemic inclusive of the introduction of new strains of the virus the federal state and local government actions taken in response vaccination rates and effectiveness the impact of vaccination requirements and the macroeconomic environment we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which covid19 impacts our business supply chain including labor availability and attrition consolidated results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our proprietary brands packaging designs and manufacturing methods are essential to the value of our business and the inability to protect our intellectual property could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights licensing agreements and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property or if we are alleged to be misappropriating or infringing on the intellectual property rights of others the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as our aromaseal ™ canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us could adversely affect our business 

we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to fail to perform brokerage services or to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

loss or interruption of supply from singlesource suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and finished goods such as kcup ® pods our pupperoni dog snacks and liquid coffee from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ® pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup ® brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making pods that will work in such proprietary brewing system in addition jde peet’s nv “jde peet’s” is our singlesource supplier for liquid coffee for our away from home business and there are a limited number of manufacturers other than jde peet’s that are able to manufacture liquid coffee if either keurig or jde peet’s are unable to supply kcup ® pods or liquid coffee respectively to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

certain of our products are produced at single manufacturing sites 

we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products into single manufacturing sites including substantially all of our coffee milkbone dog snacks and fruit spreads we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant interruption in the operation of any of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster fire or water availability whether caused by climate change or otherwise work stoppage or labor shortages or political instability terrorism armed hostilities including the recent conflict between russia and ukraine pandemic illness such as covid19 government restrictions or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business in particular substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana and is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events and some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes or wildfires can frequently occur such as alabama kansas and california in addition we are actively monitoring covid19 and its impact on our supply chain and consolidated results of operations which could be negatively impacted in a number of ways as previously noted failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in november 2021 we announced plans to invest 11 billion to build a new manufacturing facility and distribution center in mccalla alabama dedicated to the production of smucker’s uncrustables frozen sandwiches construction of this facility began in the third quarter of 2022 with production expected to begin in calendar year 2025 production of new manufacturing facilities and distribution centers could cause delays and increased costs such as shortages of materials or skilled labor unforeseen construction scheduling engineering or environmental problems impacts of adverse weather and unanticipated cost increases in addition any construction delays may impact the future demand for smucker’s uncrustables frozen sandwiches if we are unable to complete the construction of the mccalla facility within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages 

as of april 30 2022 26 percent of our fulltime employees located at eight manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with two contracts expiring in 2023 representing 9 percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the success of our business depends substantially on consumer perceptions of our brands 

we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior products we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the 

dunkin’ or rachael ray brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key employees including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented people and we may lose key employees or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented individuals any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring integrating and training qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

during 2022 we experienced an increasingly competitive labor market increased employee turnover changes in the availability of our workers including covid19related absences and labor shortages in our supply chain these challenges have resulted in and could continue to result in increased costs and could impact our ability to meet consumer demand each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions divestitures and restructurings 

our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses including the sale of the natural beverage and grains private label dry pet food crisco  and natural balance businesses and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or successfully transition divested businesses including the effective management of the related separation and stranded overhead costs and transition services our business and financial results could be negatively impacted divestitures and related restructuring costs such as the restructuring plan entered into in 2021 and expanded in 2022 require a significant amount of management and operational resources these additional demands could divert management’s attention from core business operations potentially adversely impacting existing business relationships and employee morale resulting in negative impacts on our financial performance 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost reduction and other cash management initiatives 

we continuously pursue initiatives to reduce costs increase effectiveness and optimize cash flow we may not realize all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale any failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results 

risks related to our industry 

our operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry 

the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering mislabeling food allergens adulteration of food products resulting in product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination tampering or mislabeling we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

subsequent to april 30 2022 we initiated a voluntary recall of select jif peanut butter products produced at our lexington kentucky facility and sold primarily in the us due to potential salmonella contamination at that time we also suspended the manufacturing of jif peanut butter products at the lexington facility no other products produced at our other facilities were affected by this recall as a result and in accordance with us gaap we recorded reserves of 523 in our consolidated financial statements as of april 30 2022 within our us retail consumer foods segment which was inclusive of unsaleable inventory as of april 30 2022 as well as estimated customer returns and consumer refunds related to net sales in 2022 we anticipate these costs will be recovered by insurance and as a result an insurance receivable of 498 net of the deductible was also recorded as of april 30 2022 

on june 10 2022 we announced our plans to resume manufacturing jif peanut butter products at our lexington facility further our memphis tennessee facility was not affected by the recall and has continued to manufacture jif peanut butter products however we temporarily paused shipments from the memphis facility to eliminate confusion while customers cleared their shelves of potentially impacted products manufactured at the lexington facility we will resume shipping from both the lexington and memphis facilities and are partnering with retailers to restock jif peanut butter products as soon as possible based on progress to date we believe this matter will be substantially resolved during the first quarter of 2023 based on our best estimates we anticipate an unfavorable pretax impact of approximately 1250 in 2023 net of the remaining anticipated insurance recoveries primarily related to the estimated impact of manufacturing downtime customer returns and penalties and unsaleable inventory as well as other recall related costs the recall will primarily impact our us retail consumer foods segment our ultimate loss from the jif peanut butter recall could differ materially from these estimates primarily dependent upon the magnitude of lost sales resulting from the unavailability of products for a longer period of time than anticipated as well as any resulting adverse consumer reaction including the loss of perceived value and any shift in consumer preferences 

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss of our largest customer could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 34 percent of net sales in 2022 these sales are primarily included in our us retail market segments trade receivables – net at april 30 2022 included amounts due from walmart inc and subsidiaries of 1799 million or 34 percent of the total trade receivables – net balance during 2022 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers as the retail environment continues to consolidate our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales and profitability customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the competitive food industry and continued demand for our products may be affected by our failure to effectively compete or by changes in consumer preferences 

we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs in particular technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets we are committed to serving customers and consumers in ecommerce transforming our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and enhancing our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights however if we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding ecommerce market adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through investment in innovation will be less successful in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

we may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases or may realize a decrease in sales volume to the extent price increases are implemented 

we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products including private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings or may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns or instances of increased inflationary pressures retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to competitively serve customers depends on the availability of reliable transportation increases in logistics and other transportationrelated costs could adversely impact our results of operations 

logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents natural disasters inflation or a pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic 

uncertainty or inflation consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

financial risks 

our results may be adversely impacted as a result of increased cost limited availability andor insufficient quality of raw materials including commodities and agricultural products 

we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts protein meals oils and fats grains sweeteners and fruit in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agriculturalbased products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations adverse weather conditions natural disasters water supply pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political instability armed hostilities including the recent conflict between russia and ukraine consumer demand general economic conditions such as inflationary pressures and changes in governmental agricultural programs in particular the supply chain for protein meals fats corn products and green coffee has been significantly disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and therefore the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions furthermore the price of grains and oils and fatbased products has been impacted by the recent conflict between russia and ukraine 

we also compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher costs for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use futures options basis and fixed price contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

during 2022 we experienced materially higher commodity and supply chain costs including transportation packaging manufacturing and ingredient costs due to inflationary pressures we expect the pressures of cost inflation to continue into 2023 although we take measures to mitigate inflation through the use of derivatives and pricing actions if these measures are not effective our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we expect the green coffee commodity markets to continue to be challenging due to the significant ongoing price volatility for example during 2022 we experienced drought and frost impacts which substantially reduced green coffee production in brazil due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability as compared to that of our competitors in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our efforts to manage commodity foreign currency exchange and other price volatility through derivative instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting treatment we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position furthermore as a result of covid19 we may experience an increase in the cost of or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future which could also affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities 

our fixed and variablerate debt use the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing interest rates and we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time that contain a variable element based on libor the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom no longer requires banks to submit libor since libor ceases to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties although we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this transition given our current mix of fixed and variablerate debt our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

our substantial debt obligations could restrict our operations and financial condition additionally our ability to generate cash to make payments on our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of april 30 2022 we had 45 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• exposing us to greater interest rate risk including the risk to variable borrowings of a rate increase and the risk to fixed borrowings of a rate decrease 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt 

a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

a significant portion of our assets is composed of goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2022 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 117 billion compared to total assets of 161 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 81 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset would be considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings which could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

as of april 30 2022 goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 60 billion and 26 billion respectively the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets were 24 billion and 11 billion respectively within the us retail pet foods segment and 21 billion and 12 billion respectively within the us retail coffee segment which represent approximately 80 percent of the total goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2022 furthermore the goodwill within the us retail pet foods segment remains susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value which is primarily attributable to the recognition of these assets at fair value resulting from impairment charges in recent years to date we have recognized 4650 of impairment charges related to the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired as part of the big heart pet brands “big heart” acquisition in 2015 primarily as a result of reductions in our longterm net sales and profitability projections furthermore during 2022 we recognized an impairment charge of 1504 related to the rachael ray nutrish brand that was acquired as part of the acquisition of ainsworth pet nutrition llc “ainsworth” in 2019 primarily driven by the repositioning of this brand within the pet foods brand portfolio which led to a decline in the current and longterm net sales expectations and the royalty rate used in the valuation analysis we reassessed the longterm strategic expectations for the rachael ray nutrish brand and reclassified this brand as a finitelived intangible asset on january 31 2022 for additional information refer to note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets 

we do not believe that the pet foods reporting unit or any of the indefinitelived assets within the us retail pet foods segment are more likely than not impaired as of april 30 2022 however further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the us retail pet foods segment or its brands an adverse change to macroeconomic conditions or a change to other assumptions could result in additional impairment losses in the future which could be significant as of april 30 2022 the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the remaining reporting units and material indefinitelived intangible assets and in all such instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent 

furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30 2022 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment 

we work with our suppliers to extend our payment terms which are then supplemented by a thirdparty administrator to assist in effectively managing our working capital if the extension of payment terms is reversed or the financial institution terminates its participation in the program our ability to maintain acceptable levels of working capital may be adversely affected 

as part of ongoing efforts to maximize working capital we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which includes the extension of payment terms payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable range from 0 to 180 days during 2020 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty administrator to provide an accounts payable tracking system and facilitate a supplier financing program which allows participating suppliers the ability to monitor and voluntarily elect to sell our payment obligations to a designated thirdparty financial institution participating suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements our rights and obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements as of april 30 2022 and 2021 3143 and 3042 of our outstanding payment obligations respectively were elected and sold to a financial institution by participating suppliers 

if the financial institution terminates its participation in our supplier financing program and we are unable to modify related consumer payment terms or payment terms are shortened as a result of supplier negotiations working capital could be adversely affected in addition due to terminations or negotiations we may be unable to secure alternative programs and may have to utilize various financing arrangements for shortterm liquidity or increase our longterm debt 

risks related to regulation and litigation 

we could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers 

certain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts an unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls such as the jif peanut butter product recall or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences significantly reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations and laws or their application or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes primarily in the us and canada based upon the jurisdictions in which our sales and profits are determined to be earned and taxed federal state and foreign statutory income tax rates and taxing regimes have been subject to significant change and continue to evolve our interpretation of current tax laws and their applicability to our business as well as any changes to existing laws can significantly impact our effective income tax rate and deferred tax balances in particular recent proposals brought forth by the us presidential administration include increases to federal income tax rates that if enacted could have a material impact to our financial results we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes within and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax controversies could result in material incremental tax liabilities including interest and penalties our effective income tax rate is also influenced by the geography timing nature and magnitude of transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures restructuring activities and impairment charges further in november 2021 the infrastructure investment and jobs act reinstated and expanded the 

federal superfund chemical excises tax which will be in place july 1 2022 through december 31 2031 and could materially increase our costs and impact margins 

our operations are subject to various regulations and laws in addition to tax laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us including the us food and drug administration us federal trade commission the us department of agriculture commerce and labor state regulatory agencies and other agencies as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling distribution and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains bioengineered ingredients packaging pricing advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety data privacy and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations including the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 better known as “proposition 65” which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products as well as civil penalties 

we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures and potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks 

in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change sixth assessment report global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which have contributed to and are expected to continue contributing to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts protein meals oils and fats grains sweeteners and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water or energy as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain which could increase our insurance or other operating costs or require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures specifically in 2022 hurricane ida caused our coffee manufacturing facilities in new orleans louisiana to be temporarily shut down 

and in 2021 unforeseen weather events in texas oklahoma and kansas temporarily shut down our pet manufacturing facilities in kansas although we consider these to be uncommon events and we were able to effectively minimize any disruptions through our business continuity planning efforts extreme weather could disrupt our production in the future adversely affecting our ability to meet customer deadlines and supply demands 

additionally there is an increased focus by foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions energy policies and sustainability including singleuse plastics increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment could be costly and may cause disruptions in or an increase in the costs associated with our manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as increase supply chain costs moreover compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations strategy and reporting which will likely require substantial time attention and costs 

finally we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media shareholders activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters such failure or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional regulatory requirements regarding climate change whether or not valid could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation in addition from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments including goals to reduce our impact on the environment our ability to achieve any stated goal target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control including evolving regulatory requirements and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards if we fail to achieve are perceived to have failed or are delayed in achieving these goals and commitments it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

the effects and costs of climate change and legal regulatory or market initiatives to address climate change could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

we may be unable to grow market share of our products 

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses phishing attacks malware ransomware social engineering password theft physical breaches and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyberbased attacks we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns transaction errors or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information in addition the 

cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyberbased attack could be significant 

further we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in addition certain of our processes rely on thirdparty cloud computing services if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies inaccurate financial reporting the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise 

the conflict between russia and ukraine and the related disruptions to the global economy could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the global economy has been negatively impacted by the recent conflict between russia and ukraine governments in the united states united kingdom and european union have imposed sanctions on certain products industry sectors and parties in russia although we do not have any operations in russia or ukraine we have experienced and may continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation energy and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy if the conflict continues for an extended period of time it could result in cyberattacks supply chain disruptions lower consumer demand changes in foreign exchange rates and other impacts which may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we have three reportable segments us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods the us retail market segments in total comprised 87 percent of net sales in 2022 and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold to food retailers club stores discount and dollar stores online retailers pet specialty stores natural foods stores and distributors drug stores military commissaries and mass merchandisers international and away from home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg health care operators restaurants lodging hospitality offices k12 colleges and universities and convenience stores 

strategic overview 

we remain rooted in our basic beliefs of quality people ethics growth and independence established by our founder and namesake jerome smucker more than a century ago today these basic beliefs are the core of our unique corporate culture and serve as a foundation for decisionmaking and actions we have been led by five generations of family leadership having had only six chief executive officers in 125 years this continuity of management and thought extends to the broader leadership team that embodies the values and embraces the business practices that have contributed to our consistent growth 

our strategic vision is to engage delight and inspire consumers by building brands they love and leading in growing categories this vision is our longterm direction that guides business priorities and aligns our organization we will continue to drive balanced longterm growth by advancing on the following executional priorities 

• drive commercial excellence  deliver bestinclass gotomarket execution and commercial delivery 

• streamline our cost infrastructure  focus on profitability and cost discipline 

• reshape our portfolio  optimize our portfolio to meet the evolving needs of consumers and 

• unleash our organization to win  inspire enable and empower our employees while improving diversity at every level 

our strategic growth objectives include net sales increasing by a lowsingle digit percentage and operating income excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted operating income” increasing by a midsingle digit percentage on average over the longterm related to income per diluted share excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted earnings per share” our strategic growth objective is to increase by a highsingle digit percentage over the longterm we expect organic growth including new products to drive much of our topline growth while the contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets certain divestiture acquisition integration and restructuring costs “special project costs” gains and losses on divestitures the net change in cumulative unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivative activities “change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses” and other onetime items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating 

results refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information due to the unknown and potentially prolonged impact of covid19 as well as the challenged supply network and increased labor shortages we may experience difficulties or be delayed in achieving our longterm strategies however we continue to evaluate the effects on our longterm growth objectives 

over the past five years net sales and adjusted earnings per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 2 percent and 3 percent respectively while adjusted operating income decreased at a rate of 1 percent these changes were primarily driven by increased athome consumption for the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments and the ainsworth acquisition in 2019 partially offset by the reduction in net sales from the divestitures of the private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses in 2022 crisco and natural balance businesses in 2021 and the us baking business in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1 percent over the past five years our cash deployment strategy is to balance reinvesting in our business through acquisitions and capital expenditures with returning cash to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and share repurchases our deployment strategy also includes a significant focus on debt repayment

covid19 

the spread of covid19 throughout the united states and the international community has had and will continue to have an impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business and industry 

during calendar year 2021 state governments reopened their economies while adhering to new guidelines and enhanced safety measures such as social distancing face mask protocols and vaccination requirements however there was a significant number of us cases in late calendar year 2021 and early calendar year 2022 and as a result consumers stayed at home more frequently as a precaution causing the demand related to athome food consumption to remain elevated though the impact is of a lesser extent as compared to the prior year while we continue to benefit from elevated consumption the supply chain network remains challenged due to the increased demand and supply pressures as well as covid19 cases and increasing labor shortages which continue to negatively impact our business and overall industry we anticipate this consumer behavior and athome food consumption may continue to some extent through calendar year 2022 dependent on government guidance regarding risk mitigation measures vaccination rates and effectiveness and the impact of additional covid19 variants 

in september 2021 the us president issued an executive order applicable to federal contractors and employers with 100 or more employees as a result we announced a vaccination mandate that required all employees to be vaccinated or have received an approved medical or religious exemption as early as december 2021 and no later than march 2022 dependent upon location we fully implemented the mandate for salaried employees in december 2021 prior to the us supreme court’s ruling in january 2022 to block the federal mandate however we lifted the mandate that required hourly employees to be vaccinated by march 2022 to support business continuity across our operations 

furthermore we have reopened our corporate headquarters in orrville ohio with appropriate safety protocols and as a result occupancy levels have gradually increased during 2022 while our officebased employees transition to a hybrid work schedule we continue to monitor the latest public health and government guidance related to covid19 and will adjust our approach and safety protocols as needed we have crisis management teams at all our facilities which continue to monitor their respective locations and implement additional risk mitigation actions as necessary all our production operations remain open and none have experienced significant disruptions or labor reductions related to covid19 

during 2022 we experienced increased disruption in our supply chain network including the supply of certain ingredients packaging and other sourced materials which has resulted in higher than expected inflation including escalating transportation and other supply chain costs we expect that these inflationary cost increases will continue but we expect they will be partially mitigated by pricing actions implemented in 2022 and those that we plan to implement in 2023 it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if the covid19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world including the impact of ecommerce pressures on freight charges and potential shipping delays due to supply and demand imbalances as well as labor shortages we also continue to work closely with our customers and external business partners taking additional actions to ensure safety and business continuity and maximize product availability we have maintained production at all our facilities and availability of appointments at distribution centers furthermore we have implemented measures to manage order volumes to ensure a consistent supply across our retail partners during this period of high demand however to the extent that high demand levels or the current supply chain environment continues to disrupt order fulfillment we may experience volume loss and elevated penalties 

during 2022 customer order levels remain elevated primarily across our us retail consumer foods and us retail coffee segments in response to the increased consumer demand for our products related to the elevated athome consumption further as states have reopened their economies during 2022 our net sales for the away from home channels have continued to improve compared to the initial months of the pandemic this trend could moderate during the remainder of calendar year 2022 if cases rise and governments impose additional safety measures that further impact away from home consumption which is partially dependent upon vaccination rates and effectiveness as well as the impact of additional covid19 variants overall the impact of covid19 remains uncertain and ultimately depends on the length and severity of the pandemic inclusive of the introduction of new strains of the virus the federal state and local government actions taken in response vaccination rates and effectiveness the impact of vaccination requirements and the macroeconomic environment we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which covid19 will impact our business supply chain including labor availability and attrition consolidated results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

results of operations 

this discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended april 30 2022 and 2021 for the comparisons of the years ended april 30 2021 and 2020 see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of our 2021 annual report on form 10k 

a we use nongaap financial measures to evaluate our performance refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for a reconciliation to the comparable generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” financial measure 

net sales 

amounts may not add due to rounding  

a net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange is a nongaap financial measure used to evaluate performance internally this measure provides useful information to investors because it enables comparison of results on a yearoveryear basis 

net sales in 2022 was comparable to the prior year which includes 4318 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to divestitures net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange increased 4109 or 5 percent which was primarily due to higher net price realization across each of our us retail segments and for international and away from home reflecting list price increases during 2022 

operating income 

the following table presents the components of operating income as a percentage of net sales 

amounts may not add due to rounding 

gross profit decreased 4380 or 14 percent in 2022 reflecting higher costs primarily driven by increased commodity and ingredient transportation packaging and manufacturing costs the noncomparable impact related to divestitures the unfavorable impact of unsaleable inventory and estimated customer returns related to the jif peanut butter recall and unfavorable volumemix partially offset by higher net pricing 

operating income decreased 3630 or 26 percent primarily reflecting the decrease in gross profit and a 1504 intangible asset impairment charge in 2022 related to the rachael ray nutrish brand partially offset by a 1628 decrease in selling distribution and administrative “sda” expenses primarily driven by lower marketing spend and incentive compensation expense further offsetting the decrease in operating income is a 367 increase in net other operating income primarily reflecting an anticipated insurance recovery of 498 net of the deductible related to the jif peanut butter recall that mostly offsets the unfavorable impact of unsaleable inventory estimated customer returns and consumer refunds as discussed in note 15 contingencies 

our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets special project costs gains and losses on divestitures the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses and other onetime items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information gross profit excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted gross profit” decreased 3039 or 10 percent in 2022 reflecting the exclusion of the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses and special project costs as compared to gaap gross profit adjusted operating income decreased 887 or 6 percent as compared to the prior year further reflecting the exclusion of the impairment charge and net pretax gain on divestitures 

interest expense 

net interest expense decreased 162 or 9 percent in 2022 primarily as a result of reduced debt outstanding as compared to the prior year for additional information see “capital resources” in this discussion and analysis 

income taxes 

income taxes decreased 835 or 28 percent in 2022 as compared to the prior year the effective income tax rate of 251 percent for 2022 varied from the us statutory income tax rate of 210 percent primarily due to state income taxes including an unfavorable onetime deferred tax impact of an internal legal entity simplification in the third quarter of 2022 to support multiple work locations for officebased employees and our continued strategic activities the effective income tax rate of 252 percent for 2021 varied from the us statutory income tax rate of 210 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes as well as additional net income tax expense related to the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses we anticipate a fullyear effective income tax rate for 2023 to be approximately 242 percent for additional information refer to note 13 income taxes 

restructuring activities 

a restructuring program was approved by the board during 2021 associated with opportunities identified to reduce our overall cost structure optimize our organizational design and support our portfolio reshape this is inclusive of certain restructuring costs associated with the divestitures of the crisco  natural balance  private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses for additional information related to the divestitures see note 3 divestitures 

during 2021 we substantially completed an organizational redesign related to our corporate headquarters and announced plans to close our suffolk virginia facility as a result of a new strategic partnership for the production of our liquid coffee products during 2022 we completed the transition of production to jde peet’s as anticipated furthermore the restructuring program was expanded during the third quarter of 2022 to include certain costs associated with the recent divestitures of the private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses as well as the recently announced plans to close our ripon wisconsin production facility by the end of calendar year 2022 to further optimize operations for our consumer foods business we expect to incur costs of approximately 700 associated with the restructuring activities planned to date more than half of these costs are expected to be other transition and termination costs associated with our cost reduction and margin management initiatives inclusive of accelerated depreciation while the remainder represents employeerelated costs we anticipate the planned activities associated with this restructuring program will be completed by the end of 2023 with the majority of the costs expected to be incurred in the first half of 2023 we have incurred total cumulative restructuring costs of 526 of which 285 and 241 were incurred during 2022 and 2021 respectively for further information refer to note 2 integration and restructuring costs 

commodities overview 

the raw materials we use in each of our segments are primarily commodities agriculturalbased products and packaging materials the most significant of these materials based on 2022 annual spend are green coffee peanuts protein meals grains and plastic containers green coffee corn certain meals oils and grains are traded on active regulated exchanges and the price of these commodities fluctuates based on market conditions derivative instruments including futures and options are used to minimize the impact of price volatility for these commodities 

we source green coffee from more than 20 coffeeproducing countries its price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries 

we source peanuts protein meals and oils and fats mainly from north america we are one of the largest procurers of peanuts in the us and frequently enter into longterm purchase contracts for various periods of time to mitigate the risk of a shortage of this commodity the oils we purchase are mainly peanut and soybean the price of peanuts protein meals and oils are driven primarily by weather which impacts crop sizes and yield as well as global demand especially from large importing countries such as china and india in particular the supply chain for protein meals fats corn products and green coffee has been significantly disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and therefore the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions furthermore the price of grains and oils and fatbased products has been impacted by the recent conflict between russia and ukraine 

we frequently enter into longterm contracts to purchase plastic containers which are sourced mainly from within the us plastic resin is made from petrochemical feedstock and natural gas feedstock and the price can be influenced by feedstock energy and crude oil prices as well as global economic and geopolitical conditions 

excluding the impact of derivative gains and losses our overall commodity costs in 2022 were higher than in 2021 primarily due to higher costs for green coffee protein meals oils and fats and grains 

segment results 

we have three reportable segments us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods the presentation of international and away from home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable 

the us retail pet foods segment primarily includes the domestic sales of rachael ray nutrish meow mix  milkbone  9lives kibbles ’n bits  pupperoni and nature’s recipe branded products the us retail coffee segment primarily includes the domestic sales of folgers  dunkin’  and café bustelo branded coffee and the us retail consumer foods segment primarily includes the domestic sales of smucker’s and jif branded products international and away from home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg health care operators restaurants lodging hospitality offices k12 colleges and universities and convenience stores

international and away from home net sales increased 822 in 2022 including the noncomparable impact of 226 of net sales in the prior year related to the divested crisco and natural beverage and grains businesses excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested businesses and foreign currency exchange net sales increased 877 or 9 percent primarily reflecting a 23 percent increase for the away from home operating segment partially offset by a 2 percent decrease for the international operating segment favorable volumemix for the combined businesses contributed 6 percentage points to net sales primarily driven by increases for portion control and coffee products in the away from home channels partially offset by a decrease for baking mixes and ingredients in the international operating segment net price realization contributed a 3 percentage point increase to net sales for the combined businesses primarily driven by increases for coffee products in the away from home channels and fruit spread products in the international operating segment segment profit increased 179 primarily reflecting higher net pricing favorable volumemix and the favorable foreign currency exchange impact partially offset by increased commodity costs and the noncomparable segment profit in the prior year related to the divested businesses 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings against our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents decreased to 1699 at april 30 2022 compared to 3343 at april 30 2021 

the following table presents selected cash flow information 

a free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure used by management to evaluate the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distribution acquisition opportunities share repurchases and other corporate purposes 

the 4287 decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily driven by greater working capital requirements in 2022 as well as lower net income adjusted for noncash items in the current year the increase in cash required to fund working capital as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to timing of payments for accounts payable changes in accrued incentive compensation and marketing and an increase in inventory levels compared to the prior year primarily driven by the recent input cost inflation 

cash used for investing activities in 2022 consisted primarily of 4175 in capital expenditures primarily driven by investments in smucker’s uncrustables frozen sandwiches to support the new manufacturing and distribution facilities in mccalla alabama and capacity expansion in longmont colorado as well as plant maintenance across our facilities an increase of 654 in our derivative cash margin account balances also contributed to the use of cash in 2022 these decreases were partially offset by net proceeds received from the divested private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grains businesses of 1300 cash provided by investing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of net proceeds received from the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses of 5640 and a decrease of 540 in our derivative cash margin account balances partially offset by 3067 in capital expenditures which primarily reflected capacity expansion at our longmont facility as well as plant maintenance across our facilities 

cash used for financing activities in 2022 consisted primarily of longterm debt repayments of 11570 dividend payments of 4181 and purchase of treasury shares of 2704 partially offset by 7976 in longterm debt proceeds and a net increase in shortterm borrowings of 976 cash used for financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of longterm debt repayments of 7000 purchase of treasury shares of 6784 dividend payments of 4032 and net shortterm debt repayments of 1664 

supplier financing program 

as part of ongoing efforts to maximize working capital we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which includes the extension of payment terms payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable range from 0 to 180 days during 2020 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty administrator to provide an accounts payable tracking system and facilitate a supplier financing program which allows participating suppliers the ability to monitor and voluntarily elect to sell our payment obligations to a designated thirdparty financial institution participating suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements our rights and obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements as of april 30 2022 and 2021 3143 and 3042 of our outstanding payment obligations respectively were elected and sold to a financial institution by participating suppliers during 2022 and 2021 we paid 10429 and 6635 respectively to a financial institution for payment obligations that were settled through the supplier financing program 

contingencies 

we like other food manufacturers are from time to time subject to various administrative regulatory and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business we are currently a defendant in a variety of such legal proceedings including certain lawsuits related to the alleged pricefixing of shelf stable tuna products prior to 2011 by a business previously owned by but divested prior to our acquisition of big heart the significant majority of which were settled and paid during 2019 and 2020 while we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of these proceedings or potential settlements associated with these or other matters we have accrued losses for certain contingent liabilities that we have determined are probable and reasonably estimable at april 30 2022 based on the information known to date with the exception of the matters discussed below we do not believe the final outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to the legal proceedings discussed above we are currently a defendant in council for education and research on toxics “cert” v brad barry llc et al which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants collectively the “defendants” who manufacture package distribute or sell packaged coffee failed to provide warnings for our coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under proposition 65 cert sought equitable relief including warnings to consumers as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of 2500 per day per violation of proposition 65 in addition cert asserted that every consumed cup of coffee absent a compliant warning was equivalent to a violation under proposition 65 in june 2019 the state agency responsible for administering the proposition 65 program the california office of environmental health hazard assessment “oehha” approved a regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under proposition 65 and in august 2020 the trial court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment based on the regulation cert appealed the ruling in november 2020 to the california court of appeals for the second appellate district which is currently pending 

we are also defendants in a series of putative class action lawsuits that were originally filed in federal courts in california florida illinois missouri new york texas washington and washington dc but have been transferred to the united states district court for the western district of missouri for coordinated pretrial proceedings the plaintiffs assert claims arising under various state laws for false advertising consumer protection deceptive and unfair trade practices and similar 

statutes their claims are premised on allegations that we have misrepresented the number of servings that can be made from various canisters of folgers coffee on the packaging for those products 

the outcome and the financial impact of these cases if any cannot be predicted at this time accordingly no loss contingency has been recorded for these matters as of april 30 2022 and the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable however if we are required to pay significant damages our business and financial results could be adversely impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in these locations but elsewhere for additional information see note 15 contingencies 

product recall 

subsequent to april 30 2022 we initiated a voluntary recall of select jif peanut butter products produced at our lexington kentucky facility and sold primarily in the us due to potential salmonella contamination at that time we also suspended the manufacturing of jif peanut butter products at the lexington facility no other products produced at our other facilities were affected by this recall as a result and in accordance with us gaap we recorded reserves of 523 in our consolidated financial statements as of april 30 2022 within our us retail consumer foods segment which was inclusive of unsaleable inventory as of april 30 2022 as well as estimated customer returns and consumer refunds related to net sales in 2022 we anticipate these costs will be recovered by insurance and as a result an insurance receivable of 498 net of the deductible was also recorded as of april 30 2022 

on june 10 2022 we announced our plans to resume manufacturing jif peanut butter products at our lexington facility further our memphis tennessee facility was not affected by the recall and has continued to manufacture jif peanut butter products however we temporarily paused shipments from the memphis facility to eliminate confusion while customers cleared their shelves of potentially impacted products manufactured at the lexington facility we will resume shipping from both the lexington and memphis facilities and are partnering with retailers to restock jif peanut butter products as soon as possible based on progress to date we believe this matter will be substantially resolved during the first quarter of 2023 based on our best estimates we anticipate an unfavorable pretax impact of approximately 1250 in 2023 net of the remaining anticipated insurance recoveries primarily related to the estimated impact of manufacturing downtime customer returns and penalties and unsaleable inventory as well as other recall related costs the recall will primarily impact our us retail consumer foods segment our ultimate loss from the jif peanut butter recall could differ materially from these estimates primarily dependent upon the magnitude of lost sales resulting from the unavailability of products for a longer period of time than anticipated as well as any resulting adverse consumer reaction including the loss of perceived value and any shift in consumer preferences 

capital resources 

the following table presents our capital structure 

during the second quarter of 2022 we completed an offering of 8000 in senior notes due march 15 2032 and september 15 2041 the senior notes included 72 of capitalized debt issuance costs and 24 of offering discounts and which are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt the net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to repay 7500 in principal of the senior notes due october 15 2021 furthermore during the first quarter of 2022 we prepaid 4000 in principal of the senior notes due march 15 2022 and as a result we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of 69 which primarily consisted of a makewhole payment and was included in other income expense – net in the statement of consolidated income 

we have available a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks that matures in august 2026 additionally we participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper not to exceed 20 billion at any time the commercial paper program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces what we can borrow under the revolving credit facility by the amount of commercial paper outstanding commercial 

paper is used as a continuing source of shortterm financing for general corporate purposes as of april 30 2022 we had 1800 of shortterm borrowings outstanding all of which were issued under our commercial paper program at a weightedaverage interest rate of 065 percent 

we are in compliance with all our debt covenants as of april 30 2022 and expect to be for the next 12 months for additional information on our longterm debt sources of liquidity and debt covenants see note 7 debt and financing arrangements 

during 2022 we repurchased 20 million common shares under a repurchase plan authorized by the board for 2625 at april 30 2022 approximately 58 million common shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to the board’s authorizations there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that may be repurchased or when such purchases may occur during 2021 we repurchased 58 million common shares under a repurchase plan authorized by the board for 6719 

in november 2021 we announced plans to invest 11 billion to build a new manufacturing facility and distribution center in mccalla alabama dedicated to production of smucker’s uncrustables frozen sandwiches construction of this facility began in the third quarter of 2022 with production expected to begin in calendar year 2025 the project demonstrates our commitment to meet increasing demand for this highly successful product and deliver on our strategy to focus on brands with the most significant growth opportunities construction of the facility and production will occur in three phases over multiple years and will result in the creation of up to 750 jobs financial investments and job creation will align with each of the three phases 

the following table presents certain cash requirements related to 2023 investing and financing activities based on our current expectations although no principal payments are required on our debt obligations in 2023 we may utilize a portion of our cash for debt repayment 

absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments we believe that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operations borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months including the payment of quarterly dividends principal and interest payments on debt outstanding and capital expenditures however as a result of the current economic environment we may experience an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future we continue to evaluate these risks which could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities 

as of april 30 2022 total cash and cash equivalents of 462 was held by our foreign subsidiaries primarily in canada we did not repatriate foreign cash to the us during 2022 

material cash requirements 

the following table summarizes our material cash requirements by fiscal year at april 30 2022 



a longterm debt obligations including current portion excludes the impact of offering discounts makewhole payments and debt issuance costs 

b interest payments consists of the interest payments for our fixedrate senior notes 

c purchase obligations includes agreements that are enforceable and legally bind us to purchase goods or services which primarily consist of obligations related to normal ongoing purchase obligations in which we have guaranteed payment to ensure availability of 

raw materials we expect to receive consideration for these purchase obligations in the form of materials and services these purchase obligations do not represent all future purchases expected but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated amounts included in the table above represent our current best estimate of payments due actual cash payments may vary due to the variable pricing components of certain purchase obligations 

our other cash requirements at april 30 2022 primarily included operating and finance lease obligations which consist of the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating and finance leases as of april 30 2022 we had total undiscounted minimum lease payments of 1214 and 40 related to our operating and finance leases respectively for additional information see note 11 leases 

in addition we have other liabilities which consisted primarily of projected commitments associated with our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as disclosed in note 8 pensions and other postretirement benefits including expected contributions of 800 in 2023 to our qualified defined benefit pension plans the total liability for our unrecognized tax benefits and taxrelated net interest at april 30 2022 was 74 under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes  however we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities for additional information see note 13 income taxes 

as of april 30 2022 we do not have material offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons also known as variable interest entities transactions with related parties are in the ordinary course of business and are not material to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial measures including net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange adjusted gross profit adjusted operating income adjusted income adjusted earnings per share earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and impairment charges related to intangible assets “ebitda as adjusted” and free cash flow as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures furthermore these nongaap financial measures are used by management in preparation of the annual budget and for the monthly analyses of our operating results the board also utilizes certain nongaap financial measures as components for measuring performance for incentive compensation purposes 

nongaap financial measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results which include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets special project costs gains and losses on divestitures the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses and other onetime items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results income taxes as adjusted is calculated using an adjusted effective income tax rate that is applied to adjusted income before income taxes and reflects the exclusion of the previously discussed items as well as any adjustments for onetime tax related activities when they occur while this adjusted effective income tax rate does not generally differ materially from our gaap effective income tax rate certain exclusions from nongaap results such as the onetime deferred state tax impact of the internal legal entity simplification during 2022 can significantly impact our adjusted effective income tax rate 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with us gaap rather the presentation of these nongaap financial measures supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and liquidity these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments 

the following table reconciles certain nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measure see page 28 for a reconciliation of net sales adjusted for certain noncomparable items to the comparable gaap financial measure 

a special project costs include certain divestiture acquisition integration and restructuring costs which are recognized in cost of products sold and other special project costs for more information see note 2 integration and restructuring costs and note 4 reportable segments 

b represents the nonrecurring pretax settlement charges of 296 related to the purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract to transfer our canadian defined benefit pension plan obligation to an insurance company the “canadian buyout contract”   for additional information see note 8 pensions and other postretirement benefits  

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates 

trade marketing and merchandising programs in order to support our products various promotional activities are conducted through retailers distributors or directly with consumers including instore display and product placement programs price discounts coupons and other similar activities the costs of these programs are classified as a reduction of sales we regularly review and revise when we deem necessary estimates of costs for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retailers distributors or consumers these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expenditures and actual performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period during 2022 2021 and 2020 subsequent period adjustments were less than 3 percent of both consolidated pretax income and cash provided by operating activities 

  

income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to uncertainties related to tax filing positions and periodically assess the technical merits of these tax positions for all tax years that remain subject to examination based upon the latest information available we recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits the tax position is then measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and projected future taxable income levels changes in estimated realization of deferred tax assets would result in an adjustment to income in the period in which that determination is made unless such changes are determined to be an adjustment to goodwill within the allowable measurement period under the acquisition method of accounting 

the future tax benefit arising from the net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was 1934 and 2296 at april 30 2022 and 2021 respectively in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and results of operations for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance has been provided 

as of april 30 2022 a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings primarily in canada is not considered permanently reinvested and an immaterial deferred tax liability has been recognized accordingly further we have not repatriated foreign cash to the us during 2022 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets a significant portion of our assets is composed of goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on 

february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2022 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 117 billion compared to total assets of 161 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 81 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this would result in a noncash impairment charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a marketbased approach the impairment test incorporates estimates of future cash flows allocations of certain assets liabilities and cash flows among reporting units future growth rates terminal value amounts 

and the applicable weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows the estimates and projections used in the calculation of fair value are consistent with our current and longrange plans including anticipated changes in market conditions industry trends growth rates and planned capital expenditures changes in forecasted operations and other estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2022 goodwill totaled 60 billion goodwill is substantially concentrated within the us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments during 2022 no goodwill impairment was recognized as a result of the evaluations performed throughout the year the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units for which there is a goodwill balance was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date with the exception of the pet foods reporting unit for which its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6 percent a sensitivity analysis was performed for the pet foods reporting unit assuming a hypothetical 50basispoint decrease in the expected longterm growth rate or a hypothetical 50basispoint increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the pet foods reporting unit below carrying value 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consisting entirely of trademarks are also tested for impairment at least annually and more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying values may be below their fair values to test these assets for impairment we estimate the fair value of each asset based on a discounted cash flow model using various inputs including projected revenues an assumed royalty rate and a discount rate changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2022 other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 26 billion trademarks that represent our leading brands comprise approximately 90 percent of the total carrying value of other indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2022 the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of these leading brand trademarks and in all instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent during 2022 we recognized an impairment charge of 1504 related to the rachael ray nutrish brand within the us retail pet foods segment representing the extent to which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value we reassessed the longterm strategic expectations for the rachael ray nutrish brand and reclassified this brand as a finitelived intangible asset on january 31 2022 

the carrying value of the goodwill within the us retail pet foods segment was 24 billion as of april 30 2022 and remains susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value which is primarily attributable to the recognition of these assets at fair value resulting from impairment charges in recent years any significant adverse change in our near or longterm projections or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment charges which could be material for additional information see note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets 

furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30 2022 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine the ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works various actuarial assumptions must be made in order to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date the most significant being the interest rates used to discount the obligations of the plans the longterm rates of return on the plans’ assets and mortality assumptions we along with thirdparty actuaries and investment managers review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 

we utilize a spot rate methodology for the estimation of service and interest cost for our plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows to provide a better estimate of service and interest costs for 2023 expense recognition we will use weightedaverage discount rates for the us defined benefit pension plans of 459 percent to determine benefit obligation 477 percent to determine service cost and 426 percent to determine interest cost for the canadian defined benefit pension plans we will use weightedaverage discount rates of 241 percent to determine benefit obligation and 233 percent to determine interest cost as of april 30 2022 a 50 basispoint decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the 2023 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 02 and the benefit obligation would increase by approximately 222 in addition we anticipate using an expected rate of return on plan assets of 451 percent and 160 percent for the us and canadian defined benefit pension plans respectively a 50 basispoint decrease in the expected 

rate of return on plan assets assumption would increase the 2023 net periodic benefit cost by approximately 18 a change in the assumptions used for the canadian defined benefit pension plans would not have a material impact on the net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

derivative financial instruments and market risk 

the following discussions about our market risk disclosures involve forwardlooking statements actual results could differ from those projected in the forwardlooking statements we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at april 30 2022 approximates carrying value we are exposed to interest rate risk with regard to existing debt consisting of fixed and variablerate maturities our interest rate exposure primarily includes us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the us 

we utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt transactions as well as to manage changes in the fair value of our longterm debt at the inception of an interest rate contract the instrument is evaluated and documented for qualifying hedge accounting treatment if the contract is designated as a cash flow hedge the marktomarket gains or losses on the contract are typically deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to interest expense in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings if the contract is designated as a fair value hedge the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense generally changes in the fair value of the contract are equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no net impact on earnings 

in 2020 we terminated interest rate contracts concurrent with the pricing of the senior notes due march 15 2030 and march 15 2050 they were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with the anticipated debt financing the termination resulted in a pretax loss of 2398 which was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt 

in 2018 we terminated a treasury lock concurrent with the pricing of the senior notes due december 15 2027 which was designated as a cash flow hedge and used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility the termination resulted in a pretax gain of  27  which was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the debt 

in 2015 we terminated the interest rate swap on the senior notes due october 15 2021 which was designated as a fair value hedge and used to hedge against the changes in the fair value of the debt as a result of the early termination we received 581 in cash which included 46 of accrued and prepaid interest the gain on termination was recorded as an increase in the longterm debt balance and was recognized over the life of the debt as a reduction of interest expense as of the second quarter of 2022 we had fully recognized the gain of 535 of which 40 was recognized in 2022 

in measuring interest rate risk by the amount of net change in the fair value of our financial liabilities a hypothetical 

100 basispoint decrease in interest rates at april 30 2022 would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by 3495 

commodity price risk we use certain raw materials and other commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by supply and demand conditions political and economic variables weather investor speculation and other unpredictable factors to manage the volatility related to anticipated commodity purchases we use derivatives with maturities of generally less than one year we do not qualify commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment as a result the gains and losses on all commodity derivatives are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 

the following sensitivity analysis presents our potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent change in market prices related to commodities 

the estimated fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity for the previous four quarters the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur in practice as markets move we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate the commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative instrument thus we would expect that any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of these derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures 

foreign currency exchange risk we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily denominated in canadian currency because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities financial exposure may result primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of april 30 2022 are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or 

cash flows 

we utilize foreign currency derivatives to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials and finished goods the contracts generally have maturities of less than one year we do not qualify instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold based on our hedged foreign currency positions as of april 30 2022 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates would not materially impact the fair value 

revenues from customers outside the us subject to foreign currency exchange represented 5 percent of net sales during 2022 thus certain revenues and expenses have been and are expected to be subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e or 15d15e under the exchange act as of april 30 2022 the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is 1 recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and 2 accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments have historically been seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally resulted in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters however as a result of the crisco and us baking business divestitures during 2021 and 2019 respectively the us retail consumer foods segment has experienced less seasonality additionally the us retail pet foods segment does not experience significant seasonality further reducing the overall impact of seasonality to the total company 

customers sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent of net sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 these sales are primarily included in our us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales for any year 

during 2021 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

government business no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition we are the branded market leader in the coffee dog snacks peanut butter fruit spreads and natural shelf stable juices categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles fruit spreads canned milk and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the growth of certain retail channels such as the 

ecommerce market the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty in our total us retail categories private label held a 122 dollar average market share during the 52 weeks ended april 18 2021 as compared to a 164 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year the decrease in average market share is primarily driven by excluding the shortening and oils category in 2021 as a result of the crisco divestiture we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

our primary brands and major competitors as of april 30 2021 are listed below

the covid19 pandemic and related ongoing implications could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business and industry as a result of changes in consumer behaviors retailer inventory levels cost inflation manufacturing and supply chain disruption and overall macroeconomic conditions while our overall business has benefited from increased athome consumption due to covid19 our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on evolving consumer mobility and purchasing behavior though the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of covid19 the related ongoing implications could negatively impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to the following 

• a shutdown or slowdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities due to illness or labor shortages could significantly disrupt our production capabilities particularly with respect to our coffee production substantially all of which takes place in new orleans louisiana

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of 

illness or government restrictions or the attention of our management team could be diverted if any key employees 

become ill from covid19 and are unable to work 

• an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill other intangible assets or other longlived assets or a change in the useful life of finitelived intangible assets could occur if there are sustained changes in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions 

• a decrease in demand for away from home establishments resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our away from home operations 

• an increase in working capital needs could occur caused by an increase in days sales outstanding or an extension of 

payment terms by our customers or a reduction of payment terms by our suppliers resulting from increased financial 

pressures 

• a change in demand resulting from restrictions on social interactions could affect customers’ and consumers’ plans to purchase or methods of purchasing our products 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products could result from retailers distributors or carriers modifying 

their restocking fulfillment or shipping practices 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or competitive products or our lowerpriced products

practices 

• a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties

affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities and

acquisitions and divestitures 

our proprietary brands packaging designs and manufacturing methods are essential to the value of our business and the inability to protect these could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged 

in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as our aromaseal ™ canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us could adversely affect our business 

we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to fail to perform brokerage services or to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

loss or interruption of supply from singlesource suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and finished goods such as kcup ® pods and our pupperoni dog snacks from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ® pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup ® brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making pods that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ® pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

certain of our products are produced at single manufacturing sites 

we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products into single manufacturing sites including substantially all of our coffee milkbone dog snacks fruit spreads toppings and syrups we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant interruption in the operation of any of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business in particular substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana and is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events and some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes or wildfires can frequently occur such as alabama kansas and california in addition we are actively monitoring covid19 and its impact on our supply chain and consolidated results of operations which could be negatively impacted in a number of ways as previously noted failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages 

as of april 30 2021 24 percent of our fulltime employees located at eight manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with five contracts expiring in 2022 representing 8 percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the success of our business depends substantially on consumer perceptions of our brands 

we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior products we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the dunkin’ or rachael ray brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key employees including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented people and we may lose key employees or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented individuals any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring integrating and training qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions divestitures and restructurings 

our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses including ainsworth and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses including the sale of the crisco  natural balance  and us baking businesses and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or successfully transition divested businesses including the effective management of the related separation and stranded overhead costs and transition services our business and financial results could be negatively impacted divestitures and related restructuring costs such as the restructuring plan entered into in 2021 require a significant amount of management and operational resources these additional demands could divert management’s attention from core business operations potentially adversely impacting existing business relationships and employee morale resulting in negative impacts on our financial performance 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost reduction and other cash management initiatives 

we continuously pursue initiatives to reduce costs increase effectiveness and optimize cash flow we may not realize all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale any failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results 

risks related to our industry 

our operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry 

the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss of our largest customer could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent of net sales in 2021 these sales are primarily included in our us retail market segments trade receivables – net at april 30 2021 included amounts due from walmart inc and subsidiaries of 1497 million or 28 percent of the total trade receivables – net balance during 2021 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers as the retail environment continues to consolidate our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales and profitability customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the competitive food industry and continued demand for our products may be affected by our failure to effectively compete or by changes in consumer preferences 

we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs in particular technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets we are committed to expanding our presence in ecommerce transforming our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and enhancing our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights however if we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding ecommerce market adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable 

commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through investment in innovation will be less successful in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

we may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases or may realize a decrease in sales volume to the extent price increases are implemented 

we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to competitively serve customers depends on the availability of reliable transportation increases in logistics and other transportationrelated costs could adversely impact our results of operations 

logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents natural disasters or a pandemic illness such as covid19 which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

financial risks 

our results may be adversely impacted as a result of increased cost limited availability andor insufficient quality of raw materials including commodities and agricultural products 

we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts protein meals oils and fats grains sweeteners and fruit 

in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters pandemic illness such as the covid19 pandemic foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in particular the supply chain for protein meals fats and green coffee has been significantly disrupted by the covid19 pandemic therefore the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions we also compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher costs for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use futures options basis and fixed price contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability as compared to that of our competitors in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our efforts to manage commodity foreign currency exchange and other price volatility through derivative instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting treatment we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our 

business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position furthermore as a result of covid19 we may experience an increase in the cost of or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future which could also affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities 

our fixed and variablerate debt use the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing interest rates and we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time that contain a variable element based on libor the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom has stated that it will not require banks to submit libor beyond calendar year 2021 once libor ceases to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties although we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this transition given our current mix of fixed and variablerate debt our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

our substantial debt obligations could restrict our operations and financial condition additionally our ability to generate cash to make payments on our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of april 30 2021 we had 48 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• exposing us to greater interest rate risk including the risk to variable borrowings of a rate increase and the risk to fixed borrowings of a rate decrease 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt 

a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

a significant portion of our assets is composed of goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2021 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 121 billion compared to total assets of 163 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 81 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset would be considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings which could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common 

shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

as of april 30 2021 goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 60 billion and 29 billion respectively the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets were 24 billion and 14 billion respectively within the us retail pet foods segment and 21 billion and 12 billion respectively within the us retail coffee segment which represent approximately 80 percent of the total goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2021 furthermore the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the us retail pet foods segment are susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value which is primarily attributable to the recognition of these assets at fair value resulting from recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in 2019 to date we have recognized 4650 million of impairment charges related to the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired as part of the big heart pet brands “big heart” acquisition in 2015 primarily as a result of reductions in our longterm net sales and profitability projections 

we do not believe that the pet foods reporting unit or any of the indefinitelived assets within the us retail pet foods segment are more likely than not impaired as of april 30 2021 however further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the us retail pet foods segment or its brands an adverse change to macroeconomic conditions or a change to other assumptions could result in additional impairment losses in the future which could be significant as of april 30 2021 the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of the remaining reporting units and material indefinitelived intangible assets and in all such instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent with the exception of the rachael ray nutrish brand within the us retail pet foods segment 

furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30 2021 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment specifically as it relates to the away from home reporting unit which has experienced a significant decline in demand as a result of covid19 for additional information refer to note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

risks related to regulation and litigation 

we could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers 

certain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts an unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences significantly reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations and laws or their application or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes primarily in the us and canada based upon the jurisdictions in which our sales and profits are determined to be earned and taxed federal state and foreign statutory tax rates and taxing regimes have been subject to significant change and continue to evolve our interpretation of current tax laws and their applicability to our business as well as any changes to existing laws can significantly impact our effective tax rate and deferred tax balances in particular recent proposals brought forth by the new us presidential administration include increases to federal income tax rates that if enacted could have a material impact to our financial results we are also subject to regular reviews examinations and audits by the internal revenue service “irs” and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes within and outside of the us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax controversies could 

result in material incremental tax liabilities including interest and penalties our effective tax rate is also influenced by the geography timing nature and magnitude of transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures restructuring activities and impairment charges 

our operations are subject to various regulations and laws in addition to tax laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling distribution and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging pricing advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety data privacy and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations including the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 better known as “proposition 65” which requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products as well as civil penalties 

we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures and potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks 

in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in climate or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts protein meals oils and fats grains sweeteners and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain specifically due to unforeseen weather events in texas oklahoma and kansas during 2021 our pet manufacturing facilities in kansas were temporarily shut down although we 

consider this to be an uncommon event extreme weather could disrupt our production in the future adversely affecting our ability to meet customer deadlines and supply demands 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

general risk factors 

we may be unable to grow market share of our products 

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyberbased attacks we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns transaction errors or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyberbased attack could be significant 

further we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in addition certain of our processes rely on thirdparty cloud computing services if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies inaccurate financial reporting the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

company background 

inspired by more than 120 years of business success and five generations of family leadership the j m smucker company makes food that people and pets love the company’s portfolio of 40 brands which are found in nearly 90 percent of us homes and countless away from home dining locations include iconic products consumers have always loved such as folgers  jif  and milkbone  plus new favorites like café bustelo  smucker’s uncrustables  and rachael ray nutrish  over the past two decades the company has grown by thoughtfully acquiring leading and emerging brands while ensuring the business has a positive impact on its 7000 employees the communities it is a part of and the planet 

we have three reportable segments us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods effective during the first quarter of 2021 the presentation of international and away from home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable as a result of leadership changes these operating segments are being managed and reported separately and no longer represent a reportable segment for segment reporting purposes segment results for prior periods have not been modified as the combination of these operating segments represents the previously reported international and away from home reportable segment 

the us retail market segments in total comprised 88 percent of net sales in 2021 and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america in the us retail market segments our products are sold primarily to food retailers club stores discount and dollar stores food wholesalers online retailers pet specialty stores natural foods stores and distributors drug stores military commissaries and mass merchandisers international and away from home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg health care operators restaurants lodging hospitality offices k12 colleges and universities and convenience stores 

strategic overview 

we remain rooted in our basic beliefs of quality people ethics growth and independence established by our founder and namesake jerome smucker more than a century ago today these basic beliefs are the core of our unique corporate culture and serve as a foundation for decisionmaking and actions we have been led by five generations of family leadership having had only six chief executive officers in 124 years this continuity of management and thought extends to the broader leadership team that embodies the values and embraces the business practices that have contributed to our consistent growth our strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america 

our strategic growth objectives include increasing net sales by 2 percent and operating income excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted operating income” by 5 percent on average over the long term related to income per diluted share excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted earnings per share” our strategic growth objective is to achieve an average increase of 8 percent over the long term we expect organic growth including new products to drive much of our topline growth while the contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets divestiture acquisition integration and restructuring costs “special project costs” gains and losses related to the sale of a business unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivative activities “unallocated derivative gains and losses” and other onetime items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information due to the unknown and potentially prolonged impact of covid19 we may experience difficulties or be delayed in achieving our longterm strategies however we continue to evaluate the effects from covid19 on our longterm growth objectives 

net sales has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1 percent over the past five years while adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share have increased at a rate of 1 percent and 4 percent respectively over the same period these increases were driven by increased athome consumption for the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments and the ainsworth acquisition in 2019 partially offset by the reduction in net sales from the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses in 2021 and the us baking business in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1 percent over the past five years our cash deployment strategy is to balance reinvesting in our business through acquisitions and capital expenditures with returning cash to our shareholders 

through the payment of dividends and share repurchases our deployment strategy also includes a significant focus on debt repayment 

on december 1 2020 we sold the crisco oils and shortening business to bg foods the transaction included oils and shortening products sold under the crisco brand primarily in the us and canada certain trademarks and licensing agreements dedicated manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in cincinnati ohio and approximately 160 employees who supported the crisco business under our ownership the business generated net sales of 1989 and 2692 in 2021 and 2020 respectively primarily included in the us retail consumer foods segment we received net proceeds from the divestiture of 5302 which were net of cash transaction costs and included a working capital adjustment upon completion of the transaction we recognized a pretax gain of 1148 during 2021 which is included in other operating expense income – net within the statement of consolidated income 

on january 29 2021 we sold the natural balance premium pet food business to nexus the transaction included pet food products sold under the natural balance brand certain trademarks and licensing agreements and select employees who supported the natural balance business under our ownership the business generated net sales of 1567 and 2228 in 2021 and 2020 respectively included in the us retail pet foods segment we received net proceeds from the divestiture of 338 which were net of cash transaction costs and included a working capital adjustment upon completion of the transaction we recognized a pretax loss of 895 during 2021 which is included in other operating expense income – net within the statement of consolidated income 

covid19 

the spread of covid19 throughout the united states and the international community has had and will continue to have an impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business and industry 

during 2021 state governments reopened their economies while adhering to new guidelines and enhanced safety measures such as social distancing and face mask protocols while there has been a general downward trend in us cases in calendar year 2021 consumers continue to stay at home more frequently as a precaution and as a result athome food consumption and demand remains elevated we anticipate these changes in consumer behavior to continue into 2022 dependent upon continued vaccine availability and effectiveness as well as the impact of additional strains of the virus 

we commenced a phased approach to reopen our corporate headquarters in orrville ohio with increased safety protocols however occupancy levels remain low as the majority of our officebased employees continue to work remotely where possible and we continue to monitor the latest public health and government guidance related to covid19 we have crisis management teams at all of our facilities which are monitoring the evolving situation and implementing risk mitigation actions as necessary to date there has been minimal disruption in our supply chain network including the supply of our ingredients packaging or other sourced materials although it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if the covid19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world including the impact of ecommerce pressures on freight charges and potential shipping delays due to supply and demand imbalances we also continue to work closely with our customers and external business partners taking additional actions to ensure safety and business continuity and maximize product availability we have increased production at all of our facilities and expanded the availability of appointments at distribution centers all of our production operations remain open and none have experienced significant disruptions or labor reductions related to covid19 furthermore we have implemented measures to manage order volumes to ensure a consistent supply across our retail partners during this period of high demand 

during 2021 we continued to experience an increase in orders primarily across our us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments in response to the increased consumer demand for our products related to the elevated athome consumption it is anticipated that the increase in consumer demand will continue to a lesser extent through the beginning of 2022 a decline in products sold in away from home channels has also been experienced as a result of covid19 which has negatively impacted our net sales in our away from home operating segment and we expect covid19 will continue to adversely affect our net sales while governmentmandated safety measures are in place and consumers continue to stay at home as a precaution however as states have reopened their economies during 2021 our net sales for the away from home channels improved compared to the initial months of the pandemic this trend could reverse during 2022 if cases rise and governments impose additional safety measures that further impact away from home consumption which is partially dependent upon continued vaccine availability and effectiveness overall the impact of covid19 remains uncertain and ultimately depends on the length and severity of the pandemic inclusive of the introduction of new strains of the virus the federal state and local government actions taken in response continued vaccine availability and effectiveness and the macroeconomic environment we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which covid19 will impact our business supply chain consolidated results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

results of operations 

this discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended april 30 2021 and 2020 for the comparisons of the years ended april 30 2020 and 2019 see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of our 2020 annual report on form 10k 



a we use nongaap financial measures to evaluate our performance refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure 

net sales 



amounts may not add due to rounding  

a net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange is a nongaap financial measure used to evaluate performance internally this measure provides useful information to investors because it enables comparison of results on a yearoveryear basis 

net sales in 2021 increased 2017 or 3 percent which includes 1660 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the crisco and natural balance divestitures net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange increased 3600 or 5 percent driven by favorable volumemix across all of our retail businesses supported by increased athome consumption for the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments the retail business growth was partially offset by unfavorable volumemix for the away from home operating segment 

operating income 

the following table presents the components of operating income as a percentage of net sales 



amounts may not add due to rounding 

gross profit increased 1367 or 5 percent in 2021 driven by increased contribution from volumemix and a net benefit from price and costs including a favorable change in derivative gains and losses as compared to the prior year partially offset by the noncomparable impact related to the crisco and natural balance divestitures 

operating income increased 1637 or 13 percent primarily reflecting the increase in gross profit a 524 intangible asset impairment charge in the prior year and a 253 net pretax gain related to the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses partially offset by a 488 increase in selling distribution and administrative “sda” expenses 

our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets special project costs gains and losses related to the sale of a business unallocated derivative gains and losses and other onetime items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information gross profit excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted gross profit” increased 661 or 2 percent in 2021 reflecting the exclusion of unallocated derivative gains as compared to gaap gross profit adjusted operating income increased 201 or 1 percent as compared to the prior year further reflecting the exclusion of impairment charges and the net pretax gain on divestitures 

interest expense 

net interest expense decreased 121 or 6 percent in 2021 primarily as a result of reduced debt outstanding as compared to the prior year for additional information see “capital resources” in this discussion and analysis 

other income expense – net 

net other expense increased 306 in 2021 primarily reflecting pension settlement charges of 355 which includes the aggregate 296 pretax settlement charges recognized during 2021 related to the purchase of a group annuity contract to transfer our canadian defined benefit pension plan obligations to an insurance company for further information refer to note 9 pensions and other postretirement benefits 

income taxes 

income taxes increased 484 or 20 percent in 2021 as compared to the prior year the effective tax rate of 252 percent for 2021 varied from the us statutory tax rate of 210 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes as well as additional net income tax expense related to the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses during the third quarter of 2021 the effective tax rate of 241 percent for 2020 varied from the us statutory tax rate of 210 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 240 percent for additional information refer to note 14 income taxes 

restructuring activities 

a restructuring program was approved by the board during the third quarter of 2021 associated with opportunities identified to reduce our overall cost structure and optimize our organizational design inclusive of stranded overhead associated with recent divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses for additional information related to these divestitures see note 4 divestitures during the fourth quarter of 2021 we substantially completed an organizational redesign related to our corporate headquarters and announced plans to close our suffolk virginia production facility by the end of 2022 as a result of a new strategic partnership for the production of our away from home liquid coffee while the entire scope of the program cannot be quantified at this time we expect to incur approximately 850 in costs associated with the restructuring activities approved to date approximately half of these costs are expected to be accelerated depreciation and other transition and termination costs associated with our cost reduction and margin management initiatives while the remainder represents employeerelated costs we anticipate the activities associated with this restructuring program will be completed by the end of 2023 with over half of the costs expected to be incurred by the end of 2022 we have incurred total cumulative restructuring costs of 241 which were all incurred during the second half of 2021 for further information refer to note 3 integration and restructuring costs 

commodities overview 

the raw materials we use in each of our segments are primarily commodities agriculturalbased products and packaging materials the most significant of these materials based on 2021 annual spend are green coffee peanuts protein meals oils and fats and plastic containers green coffee corn certain meals oils and grains are traded on active regulated exchanges and the price of these commodities fluctuates based on market conditions derivative instruments including futures and options are used to minimize the impact of price volatility for these commodities 

we source green coffee from more than 20 coffeeproducing countries its price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries 

we source peanuts protein meals and oils and fats mainly from north america we are one of the largest procurers of peanuts in the us and frequently enter into longterm purchase contracts for various periods of time to mitigate the risk of a shortage of this commodity the oils we purchase are mainly peanut and soybean the price of peanuts protein meals and oils are driven primarily by weather which impacts crop sizes and yield as well as global demand especially from large importing countries such as china and india in particular the supply chain for protein meals fats and green coffee has been significantly disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and therefore the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions furthermore the price of peanuts has been impacted by the recent decrease in crop supply 

we frequently enter into longterm contracts to purchase plastic containers which are sourced mainly from within the us plastic resin is made from petrochemical feedstock and natural gas feedstock and the price can be influenced by feedstock energy and crude oil prices as well as global economic conditions 

excluding the impact of derivative gains and losses our overall commodity costs in 2021 were higher than in 2020 primarily due to higher costs for green coffee and peanuts 

segment results 

we have three reportable segments us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods effective during the first quarter of 2021 the presentation of international and away from home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable as a result of leadership changes these operating segments are being managed and reported separately and no longer represent a reportable segment for segment reporting purposes segment results for prior periods have not been modified as the combination of these operating segments represents the previously reported international and away from home reportable segment 

the us retail pet foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of rachael ray nutrish meow mix  milkbone  9lives kibbles ’n bits  pupperoni and nature’s recipe branded products the us retail coffee segment primarily includes the domestic sales of folgers  dunkin’  and café bustelo branded coffee and the us retail consumer foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of smucker’s and jif branded products international and away from home includes the sale of products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg health care operators restaurants lodging hospitality offices k12 colleges and universities and convenience stores 



us retail pet foods 

the us retail pet foods segment net sales decreased 250 in 2021 inclusive of the impact of 536 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divested natural balance business excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business net sales increased 286 or 1 percent primarily due to favorable volumemix partially offset by lower net price realization the favorable volumemix contributed 2 percentage points to net sales primarily reflecting growth for dog snacks and cat food driven by milkbone and pupperoni dog snacks as well as 9lives and meow mix cat food partially offset by declines for dog food driven by nature’s recipe and kibbles ’n bits  lower net price realization reduced net sales by 1 percentage point primarily reflecting increased trade spend segment profit decreased 657 driven by lower net pricing increased marketing expense and a recovery in the prior year from a legal settlement related to a supplier issue 

us retail coffee 

the us retail coffee segment net sales increased 2251 in 2021 reflecting favorable volumemix which contributed 11 percentage points to net sales related to growth for the dunkin’ café bustelo and folgers brands the favorable volumemix primarily reflects elevated athome coffee consumption net price realization reduced net sales by 1 percentage point segment profit increased 781 primarily due to the favorable volumemix partially offset by increased marketing expense 

us retail consumer foods 

the us retail consumer foods segment net sales increased 1040 in 2021 inclusive of the impact of 1012 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divested crisco business excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business net sales increased 2052 or 13 percent primarily due to favorable volumemix which contributed 8 percentage points to net sales reflecting growth for the smucker’s brand inclusive of uncrustables frozen sandwiches and fruit spreads and jif peanut butter the favorable volumemix primarily reflects elevated athome consumption and continued growth of our uncrustables brand higher net pricing increased net sales by 4 percentage points primarily driven by the impact of a peanut butter list price increase taken on the jif brand during the second quarter of 2021 segment profit increased 828 reflecting the favorable impact of higher net pricing the increased contribution from volumemix and the lapping of a writeoff of equipment related to the discontinuation of jif power ups ® during the prior year partially offset by the noncomparable segment profit in the prior year related to the divested crisco business and increased marketing expense 

international and away from home 

international and away from home net sales decreased 1024 in 2021 including the noncomparable impact of 112 of net sales in the prior year related to the divested crisco business excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business net sales decreased 912 primarily reflecting a 21 percent decline for the away from home operating segment partially offset by net sales growth of 4 percent for the international operating segment unfavorable volumemix for the combined businesses reduced net sales by 10 percentage points primarily driven by coffee portion control and sweetener products in away from home channels these declines were partially offset by gains for uncrustables frozen sandwiches in away from home channels and dog snacks and cat food in the international operating segment foreign currency exchange had a 77 favorable impact on net sales segment profit decreased 493 primarily reflecting the unfavorable volumemix and higher input costs partially offset by lower sda expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings against our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents decreased to 3343 at april 30 2021 compared to 3911 at april 30 2020 

the following table presents selected cash flow information 



a free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure used by management to evaluate the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distribution acquisition opportunities share repurchases and other corporate purposes 

the 3102 increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily driven by a favorable benefit from lapping the settlement of interest rate contracts for 2398 during 2020 in addition net income adjusted for noncash items was higher in the current year the cash required to fund working capital decreased compared to the prior year primarily related to lower payments for accounts payable driven by working capital initiatives inclusive of a supplier financing program entered into during the second half of 2020 and an increase in cash from trade receivables due to the timing of sales and payments which was mostly offset by increased inventory levels reflecting the lapping of increased consumer demand in the fourth quarter of 2020 

cash provided by investing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of net proceeds from the divestitures of the crisco and natural balance businesses of 5640 and a decrease of 540 in our derivative cash margin account balances partially offset by 3067 in capital expenditures cash used for investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of 2693 in capital expenditures 

cash used for financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of longterm debt repayments of 7000 purchase of treasury shares of 6784 dividend payments of 4032 and a net decrease in shortterm borrowings of 1664 cash used for financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of longterm debt repayments of 9000 dividend payments of 3968 and a 1858 net decrease in shortterm borrowings partially offset by 7982 in longterm debt proceeds 

supplier financing program 

as part of ongoing efforts to maximize working capital we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which includes the extension of payment terms payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable generally range from 0 to 120 days during the second half of 2020 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty administrator to provide an accounts payable tracking system and facilitate a supplier financing program which allows participating suppliers the ability to monitor and voluntarily elect to sell our payment obligations to a designated thirdparty financial institution participating suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements as of april 30 2021 and 2020 3042 and 1575 of our outstanding payment obligations respectively were elected and sold to a financial institution by participating suppliers during 2021 and 2020 we paid 6635 and 318 respectively to a financial institution for payment obligations that were settled through the supplier financing program 

contingencies 

we like other food manufacturers are from time to time subject to various administrative regulatory and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business we are currently a defendant in a variety of such legal proceedings including certain lawsuits related to the alleged pricefixing of shelf stable tuna products prior to 2011 by a business previously owned by but divested prior to our acquisition of big heart the significant majority of which were settled and paid during 2019 and 2020 while we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of the remaining proceedings or potential settlements associated with these or other matters we have accrued losses for certain contingent liabilities that we have determined are probable and reasonably estimable at april 30 2021 based on the information known to date with the exception of the matters discussed below we do not believe the final outcome of these proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to the legal proceedings discussed above we are currently a defendant in council for education and research on toxics “cert” v brad barry llc et al which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants collectively the “defendants” who manufacture package distribute or sell packaged coffee failed to provide warnings for our coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under proposition 65 cert sought equitable relief including warnings to consumers as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of 2500 per day per violation of proposition 65 in addition cert asserted that every consumed cup of coffee absent a compliant warning was equivalent to a violation under proposition 65 in june 2019 the state agency responsible for administering the proposition 65 program the california office of environmental health hazard assessment “oehha” approved a regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under proposition 65 and in august 2020 the trial court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment based on the regulation cert appealed the ruling in november 2020 to the california court of appeals for the second appellate district which is currently pending 

we are also defendants in nine pending putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts in california florida illinois 

missouri texas washington and washington dc the plaintiffs in those actions assert claims arising under various state 

laws for false advertising consumer protection deceptive and unfair trade practices and similar statutes their claims are 

premised on allegations that we have misrepresented the number of servings that can be made from various canisters of 

folgers coffee on the packaging for those products five of the lawsuits have been transferred to the united states district 

court for the western district of missouri for coordinated pretrial proceedings similar claims have been asserted against 

certain retailers of our folgers coffee products and indemnity claims have been asserted by such retailers against us various 

other potential plaintiffs have threatened to assert similar claims against us 

the outcome and the financial impact of these cases if any cannot be predicted at this time accordingly no loss 

contingency has been recorded for these matters as of april 30 2021 and the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or 

estimable however if we are required to pay significant damages our business and financial results could be adversely 

impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in these locations but elsewhere for additional information see note 16 contingencies 

capital resources 

the following table presents our capital structure 



during the third quarter of 2021 we prepaid in full the remaining outstanding balance of the 15 billion term loan credit agreement “term loan” that was entered into in april 2018 to partially finance the ainsworth acquisition as discussed in note 2 acquisition during 2021 and 2020 we prepaid 7000 and 1000 on the term loan respectively 

we have available a 18 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks that matures in september 2022 additionally we participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper not to exceed 18 billion at any time the commercial paper program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces what we can borrow under the revolving credit facility by the amount of commercial paper outstanding commercial paper will be used as a continuing source of shortterm financing for general corporate purposes as of april 30 2021 we had 820 of shortterm borrowings outstanding all of which were issued under our commercial paper program at a weightedaverage interest rate of 017 percent 

we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information on our longterm debt sources of liquidity and debt covenants see note 8 debt and financing arrangements 

on october 22 2020 the board authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million common shares in addition to the 36 million common shares that remained available for repurchase pursuant to prior authorizations of the board for a total of 86 million common shares available for repurchase under the repurchase program a total of 58 million common shares were repurchased for 6719 during 2021 included in the total repurchases during the third quarter of 2021 were 20 million common shares repurchased under a 10b51 plan entered into on december 30 2020 at april 30 2021 approximately 28 million common shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to the board’s authorizations we did not repurchase any common shares under a repurchase plan authorized by the board during 2020 

the following table presents certain cash requirements related to 2022 investing and financing activities based on our current expectations 



absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments we believe that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operations borrowings available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months including the payment of quarterly dividends principal and interest payments on debt outstanding and capital expenditures however as a result of covid19 we may experience an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future which could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities 

during 2021 we returned 1000 of foreign cash to the us from canada the repatriation was subject to 50 of foreign withholding taxes while us federal and state income taxes were not significant as of april 30 2021 we have reevaluated our global cash needs and determined that a portion of our undistributed earnings primarily in canada are no longer permanently reinvested resulting in the recognition of an immaterial deferred tax liability 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial measures including net sales excluding divestitures and foreign currency exchange adjusted gross profit adjusted operating income adjusted income adjusted earnings per share earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and impairment charges related to intangible assets “ebitda as adjusted” and free cash flow as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures furthermore these nongaap financial measures are used by management in preparation of the annual budget and for the monthly analyses of our operating results the board also utilizes certain nongaap financial measures as components for measuring performance for incentive compensation purposes 

nongaap financial measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results which include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets special project costs gains and losses related to the sale of a business unallocated derivative gains and losses and other onetime items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results additionally income taxes as adjusted is calculated using an adjusted effective income tax rate that is applied to adjusted income before income taxes and reflects the exclusion of the previously discussed items as well as any adjustments for onetime tax related activities when they occur while this adjusted effective income tax rate does not generally differ materially from our gaap effective tax rate certain exclusions from nongaap results such as the permanent tax impacts associated with the crisco and natural balance divestitures can significantly impact our adjusted effective income tax rate 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with us gaap rather the presentation of these nongaap financial measures supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and liquidity these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments 

the following table reconciles certain nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measure see 

page 23 for a reconciliation of net sales adjusted for certain noncomparable items to the comparable gaap financial measure 



a represents the nonrecurring pretax settlement charges of 296 related to the purchase of a group annuity contract to transfer our canadian defined benefit pension plan obligation to an insurance company for additional information see note 9 pensions and other postretirement benefits  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have material offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons also known as variable interest entities transactions with related parties are in the ordinary course of business and are not material to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations by fiscal year at april 30 2021 



a longterm debt obligations including current portion excludes the impact of offering discounts makewhole payments and debt issuance costs 

b interest payments consists of the interest payments for our fixedrate senior notes 

c operating lease obligations consists of the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

d purchase obligations includes agreements that are enforceable and legally bind us to purchase goods or services which primarily consist of obligations related to normal ongoing purchase obligations in which we have guaranteed payment to ensure availability of raw materials we expect to receive consideration for these purchase obligations in the form of materials and services these purchase obligations do not represent all future purchases expected but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated amounts included in the table above represent our current best estimate of payments due actual cash payments may vary due to the variable pricing components of certain purchase obligations 

e other liabilities consists primarily of projected commitments associated with our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as well as 45 related to financing lease obligations the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and taxrelated net interest of 119 under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes  is excluded since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates 

trade marketing and merchandising programs in order to support our products various promotional activities are conducted through retail distributors or directly with consumers including instore display and product placement programs price discounts coupons and other similar activities the costs of these programs are classified as a reduction of sales we regularly review and revise when we deem necessary estimates of costs for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retail distributors or consumers these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expenditures and actual performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period during 2021 2020 and 2019 subsequent period adjustments were less than 2 percent of both consolidated pretax income and cash provided by operating activities these promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of sales represented 39 percent of net sales in 2021 

  

income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to uncertainties related to tax filing positions and periodically assess the technical merits of these tax positions for all tax years that remain subject to examination based upon the latest information available for material uncertain tax positions we have recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits including any applicable interest and penalty charges 

we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and projected future taxable income levels changes in estimated realization of deferred tax assets would result in an adjustment to income in the period in which that determination is made unless such changes are determined to be an adjustment to goodwill within the allowable measurement period under the acquisition method of accounting 

the future tax benefit arising from the net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was 2296 and 2448 at april 30 2021 and 2020 respectively in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and results of operations for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance would have been provided 

as of april 30 2021 the company has reevaluated its global cash needs and determined that a portion of the undistributed foreign earnings primarily in canada are no longer permanently reinvested 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets a significant portion of our assets is composed of goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2021 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 121 billion compared to total assets of 163 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 81 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a marketbased approach the impairment test incorporates estimates of future cash flows allocations of certain assets liabilities and cash flows among reporting units future growth rates terminal value amounts and the applicable weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows the estimates and projections used in the calculation of fair value are consistent with our current and longrange plans including anticipated changes in market conditions industry trends growth rates and planned capital expenditures changes in forecasted operations and other estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2021 goodwill totaled 60 billion goodwill is substantially concentrated within the us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments during 2021 no goodwill impairment was recognized as a result of the evaluations performed throughout the year the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units for which there is a goodwill balance was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date with the exception of the pet foods reporting unit for which its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6 percent a sensitivity analysis was performed for the pet foods reporting unit assuming a hypothetical 50basispoint decrease in the expected longterm growth rate or a hypothetical 50basispoint increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the pet foods reporting unit below carrying value 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consisting entirely of trademarks are also tested for impairment at least annually and more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying values may be below their fair values to test these assets for impairment we estimate the fair value of each asset based on a discounted cash flow model using various inputs including projected revenues an assumed royalty rate and a discount rate changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2021 other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 29 billion trademarks that represent our leading brands comprise approximately 90 percent of the total carrying value of other indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2021 the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of these leading brand trademarks and in all instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent with the exception of the rachael ray nutrish brand within the us retail pet foods segment 

the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the us retail pet foods segment were 

24 billion and 14 billion respectively as of april 30 2021 these intangible assets remain susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value which is primarily attributable to the recognition of these assets at fair value resulting from recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in 2019 any significant adverse change in our near or longterm projections or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment charges which could be material 

furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30 2021 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment specifically as it relates to the away from home reporting unit which has experienced a significant decline in demand as a result of covid19 as of april 30 2021 the goodwill related to the away from home reporting unit represented approximately 60 percent of the goodwill within international and away from home for additional information see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine the ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works various actuarial assumptions must be made in order to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date the most significant being the interest rates used to discount the obligations of the plans the longterm rates of return on the plans’ assets mortality assumptions assumed pay increases and the health care cost trend rates we along with thirdparty actuaries and investment managers review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 

we utilize a spot rate methodology for the estimation of service and interest cost for our plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows to provide a better estimate of service and interest costs for 2022 expense recognition we will use weightedaverage discount rates for the us defined benefit pension plans of 313 percent to determine benefit obligation 353 percent to determine service cost and 240 percent to determine interest cost and a rate of compensation increase of 355 percent for the canadian defined benefit pension plans we will use weightedaverage discount rates of 215 percent to determine benefit obligation and 195 percent to determine interest cost in addition we anticipate using an expected rate of return on plan assets of 459 percent and 170 percent for the us and canadian defined benefit pension plans respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

derivative financial instruments and market risk 

the following discussions about our market risk disclosures involve forwardlooking statements actual results could differ from those projected in the forwardlooking statements we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at april 30 2021 approximates carrying value we are exposed to interest rate risk with regard to existing debt consisting of fixed and variablerate maturities our interest rate exposure primarily includes us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the us the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom has stated that it will not require banks to submit libor beyond calendar year 2021 we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this action given our current mix of fixed and variablerate debt 

we utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt transactions as well as to manage changes in the fair value of our longterm debt at the inception of an interest rate contract the instrument is evaluated and documented for qualifying hedge accounting treatment if the contract is designated as a cash flow hedge the marktomarket gains or losses on the contract are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to interest expense in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings if the contract is designated as a fair value hedge the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense generally changes in the fair value of the contract are equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no net impact on earnings 

in 2020 we terminated interest rate contracts concurrent with the pricing of the senior notes due march 15 2030 and march 15 2050 they were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with the anticipated debt financing the termination resulted in a pretax loss of 2398 which was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt 

in 2015 we terminated the interest rate swap on the senior notes due october 15 2021 which was designated as a fair value hedge and used to hedge against the changes in the fair value of the debt as a result of the early termination we received 581 in cash which included 46 of accrued and prepaid interest and a 535 benefit that was deferred as a component of the carrying value of the longterm debt and is being recognized ratably as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the debt at april 30 2021 the remaining benefit of 40 was recorded as an increase in the longterm debt balance 

in measuring interest rate risk by the amount of net change in the fair value of our financial liabilities a hypothetical 

100basispoint decrease in interest rates at april 30 2021 would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by 3860 

commodity price risk we use certain raw materials and other commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by supply and demand conditions political and economic variables weather investor speculation and other unpredictable factors to manage the volatility related to anticipated commodity purchases we use derivatives with maturities of generally less than one year we do not qualify commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment as a result the gains and losses on all commodity derivatives are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 

the following sensitivity analysis presents our potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent change in market prices related to commodities 



the estimated fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity for the previous four quarters the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur in practice as markets move we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate the commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative instrument thus we would expect that any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of these derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures 

foreign currency exchange risk we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily denominated in canadian currency because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities financial exposure may result primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of april 30 2021 are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or 

cash flows 

we utilize foreign currency derivatives to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials and finished goods the contracts generally have maturities of less than one year we do not qualify instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold based on our hedged foreign currency positions as of april 30 2021 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates would not materially impact the fair value 

revenues from customers outside the us subject to foreign currency exchange represented 5 percent of net sales during 2021 thus certain revenues and expenses have been and are expected to be subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results

6 percent of consolidated net sales for 2020 our branded food and beverage products include a strong portfolio of trusted iconic marketleading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in north america 

on may 14 2018 we acquired the equity of ainsworth pet nutrition llc “ainsworth” in an allcash transaction which was funded by debt and valued at 19 billion ainsworth was a leading producer distributor and marketer of premium pet food and pet snacks predominantly within the us for additional information refer to note 2 acquisition 

on august 31 2018 we sold our us baking business to brynwood partners vii lp and brynwood partners viii lp subsidiaries of brynwood partners an unrelated party the transaction included products that were primarily sold in us retail channels under the pillsbury ®  martha white ®  hungry jack ®  white lily ®  and jim dandy ® brands along with all relevant trademarks and licensing agreements and our manufacturing facility in toledo ohio this business generated net sales of approximately 3700 million in 2018 the transaction did not include our baking business in canada for additional information refer to note 4 divestiture 

we have four reportable segments us retail pet foods us retail coffee us retail consumer foods and international and away from home the us retail market segments in total comprised 87 percent of 2020 consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america the international and away from home segment represents sales outside of the us retail market segments 

principal products our principal products as of april 30 2020 are coffee dog food cat food pet snacks peanut butter fruit spreads frozen handheld products shortening and oils portion control products juices and beverages and baking mixes and ingredients product sales information for the years 2020 2019 and 2018 is included within note 5 reportable segments 

in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers club stores discount and dollar stores food wholesalers online retailers pet specialty stores natural foods stores and distributors drug stores military commissaries and mass merchandisers in the international and away from home segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg health care operators restaurants lodging hospitality offices k12 colleges and universities and convenience stores 

sources and availability of raw materials the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats sweeteners grains fruit and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures options and fixed price contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source peanuts animal protein meals and oils and fats mainly from north america the principal packaging materials we use are plastic glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate for additional information on the commodities we purchase see “commodities overview” within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing 

trademarks and patents  our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries our major trademarks as of april 30 2020 are listed below 



dunkin’ tm and dunkin’ donuts are trademarks of dd ip holder llc used under two licenses the “dunkin’ licenses” for packaged coffee products including kcup ® pods sold in retail channels such as grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores and drug stores all references to dunkin’ in this annual report on form 10k are deemed to include the dunkin’ and dunkin’ donuts trademarks the dunkin’ licenses do not pertain to dunkin’ coffee or other products for sale in dunkin’ restaurants the terms of the dunkin’ licenses include the payment of royalties to an affiliate of dd ip holder llc and other financial commitments by the company the dunkin’ licenses are in effect until january 1 2039

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments have historically been seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally resulted in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the fall bake and holiday period has typically had a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year additionally the back to school period and the spring holiday season are important promotional periods however as a result of the us baking business divestiture during 2019 the us retail consumer foods segment has experienced less seasonality additionally the us retail pet foods segment which grew during 2019 as a result of the ainsworth acquisition does not experience significant seasonality further reducing the overall impact of seasonality to the total company 

working capital working capital requirements have historically been greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee shortening and oils and baking inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season the impact of seasonality on our overall working capital requirements has been partially reduced by the us retail pet foods segment which does not experience significant seasonality the divestiture of the us baking business and the acquisition of ainsworth during 2019 have further reduced the seasonality of our overall working capital requirements 

customers sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent 32 percent and 31 percent of net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2020 2019 or 2018 

during 2020 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition we are the branded market leader in the coffee dog snacks peanut butter fruit spreads natural shelf stable juices ice cream toppings and shortening categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles fruit spreads canned milk shortening and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the growth of certain retail channels such as the 

ecommerce market the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty in our total us retail categories private label held a 164 dollar average market share during the 52 weeks ended april 19 2020 as compared to a 166 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

our primary brands and major competitors as of april 30 2020 are listed below 



a identifies the current market leader within the product category in certain categories the market leader is not identified as two or more brands compete for the largest share 

b crisco is the market leader within the shortening category in the oils category private label brands collectively maintain the largest share 

environmental matters we consider it to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen to be compliant with environmental regulations and focus on environmental sustainability as such we have public goals related to waste diversion water usage intensity reduction greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction and packaging recyclability in addition we have implemented and manage a variety of programs across our operations including energy optimization the utilization of renewable energy water conservation the reuse of resources and the support of farmers who implement sustainable practices in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2021 

employees at april 30 2020 we had approximately 7300 fulltime employees worldwide of which 24 percent located at nine manufacturing locations are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on location with two contracts expiring in 2021 representing 2 percent of our total employees we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   

the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19” could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

the continued spread of covid19 throughout the united states and the international community has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business and industry covid19 could negatively impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways including but not limited to the following 

• a shutdown or slowdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities due to illness could significantly disrupt our 

production capabilities particularly with respect to our coffee production substantially all of which takes place in new orleans louisiana 

• a slowdown or stoppage in our supply chain could result from government restrictions or labor shortages due to illness or if our suppliers vendors distributors or thirdparty manufacturers fail to meet their obligations to us or experience disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a strain on our supply chain could result from increased consumer demand at our retail and ecommerce customers 

• an increase in commodity and other input costs could result from market volatility particularly with respect to animal protein meals and fats the supply chain for which has been significantly disrupted by covid19 

• a significant portion of our workforce including our management team could become unable to work as a result of 

illness or government restrictions or the attention of our management team could be diverted if any key employees 

become ill from covid19 and are unable to work 

• an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets or a change in the useful life of definitelived 

intangible assets could occur if there are sustained changes in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions 

• a decrease in demand for away from home establishments resulting from government restrictions and social distancing measures has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our away from home operations 

• an increase in working capital needs could occur caused by an increase in days sales outstanding or an extension of 

payment terms by our customers or a reduction of payment terms by our suppliers resulting from increased financial 

pressures 

• a change in demand resulting from restrictions on social interactions could affect customers’ and consumers’ plans to purchase or methods of purchasing our products 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products could result from retailers distributors or carriers modifying 

their restocking fulfillment or shipping practices 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or competitive products or our lowerpriced products 

• a change in trade promotions and marketing activities could occur in response to changes in consumer viewing and 

shopping habits resulting from the cancellation of major events travel restrictions and changes in instore shopping 

practices 

• a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties 

• an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future could 

affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities and 

• an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to implement price increases resulting from commodity or other input cost increases or to execute strategic business activities including 

acquisitions and divestitures 

we may be unable to grow market share of our products 

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

our proprietary brands packaging designs and manufacturing methods are essential to the value of our business and the inability to protect these could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as our aromaseal ™ canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us could adversely affect our business 

we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to fail to perform brokerage services or to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

loss or interruption of supply from singlesource suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and crisco oil products and finished goods such as kcup ® pods and our pupperoni dog snacks from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ® pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup ® brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ® pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be adversely impacted as a result of increased cost limited availability andor insufficient quality of raw materials including commodities and agricultural products 

we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats sweeteners grains and fruit in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters pandemic illness such as the covid19 outbreak foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in particular the supply chain for animal protein meals and fats has been significantly disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and therefore the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions we also compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher costs for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures options and fixed price contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability as compared to that of our competitors in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our efforts to manage commodity foreign currency exchange and other price volatility through derivative instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

we may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases or may realize a decrease in sales volume to the extent price increases are implemented 

we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix 

toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our products are produced at single manufacturing sites 

we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products into single manufacturing sites including substantially all of our coffee milkbone dog snacks fruit spreads toppings and syrups we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant interruption in the operation of any of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness such as the covid19 outbreak or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business in particular substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana and is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events and some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes or wildfires can frequently occur such as alabama kansas and california in addition we are actively monitoring covid19 and its impact on our supply chain and consolidated results of operations which could be negatively impacted in a number of ways as previously noted failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages 

as of april 30 2020 24 percent of our fulltime employees located at nine manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with two contracts expiring in 2021 representing 2 percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to competitively serve customers depends on the availability of reliable transportation increases in logistics and other transportationrelated costs could adversely impact our results of operations 

logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents natural disasters or a pandemic illness such as covid19 which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry 

the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product 

liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss of our largest customer could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent of net sales in 2020 these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2020 included amounts due from walmart inc and subsidiaries of 1319 million or 24 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2020 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the competitive food industry and continued demand for our products may be affected by our failure to effectively compete or by changes in consumer preferences 

we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs in particular technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets we are committed to expanding our presence in ecommerce transforming our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and enhancing our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights however if we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding ecommerce market adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through investment in innovation will be less successful in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

the success of our business depends substantially on consumer perceptions of our brands 

we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably 

superior products we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the dunkin’ or rachael ray brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability 

we could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers 

certain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts an unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences significantly reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key employees including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented people and we may lose key employees or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented individuals any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring integrating and training qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures specifically we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the ainsworth acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses including ainsworth and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses including the sale of our us baking business and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses including the effective management of the related separation and stranded overhead costs our business and financial results could be negatively impacted 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost reduction and other cash management initiatives 

we continuously pursue initiatives to reduce costs increase effectiveness and optimize cash flow we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale any failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position furthermore as a result of covid19 we may experience an increase in the cost of or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future which could also affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities 

our fixed and variablerate debt use the london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark for establishing interest rates and we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time that contain a variable element based on libor the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom has stated that it will not require banks to submit libor beyond 2021 once libor ceases to be available we may need to amend affected agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties although we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this transition given our current mix of fixed and variablerate debt our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected 

our substantial debt obligations could restrict our operations and financial condition additionally our ability to generate cash to make payments on our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of april 30 2020 we had approximately 56 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt partially as a result of our borrowings in 2019 to finance the ainsworth acquisition we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital 

expenditures which could impede our growth our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• exposing us to greater interest rate risk including the risk to variable borrowings of a rate increase and the risk to fixed borrowings of a rate decrease 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt 

a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at 

april 30 2020 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 127 billion compared to total assets of 

170 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 82 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset would be considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings which could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

as of april 30 2020 goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 63 billion and 29 billion respectively the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets were 24 billion and 14 billion respectively within the us retail pet foods segment and 21 billion and 12 billion respectively within the us retail coffee segment which represent approximately 75 percent of the total goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2020 furthermore the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the us retail pet foods segment are susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value as a result of recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in may 2018 to date we have recognized 4650 million of impairment charges related to the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired as part of the big heart pet brands “big heart” acquisition in 2015 primarily as a result of reductions in our longterm net sales and profitability projections 

we do not believe that our pet foods reporting unit or any of the indefinitelived assets within the us retail pet foods segment are more likely than not impaired as of april 30 2020 however further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the us retail pet foods segment or its brands an adverse change to macroeconomic conditions or a change to other assumptions could result in additional impairment losses in the future which could be significant as of april 30 2020 the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of the remaining reporting units and material indefinitelived intangible assets and in all such instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent 

furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30 2020 any significant sustained 

adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment specifically as it relates to the away from home reporting unit which has experienced a significant decline in demand as a result of covid19 for additional information refer to note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations and laws or their application or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling distribution and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging pricing advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety data privacy and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 better known as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products as well as civil penalties the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement in particular we are currently a defendant in council for education and research on toxics “plaintiff” or “cert” v brad barry llc et al which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants who manufacture package distribute or sell packaged coffee failed to warn persons in california that our coffee products expose persons to the chemical acrylamide which is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts measured in parts per billion as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process in violation of proposition 65 if we are required to pay significant statutory penalties or to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 our business and financial results could be adversely impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures and potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks 

in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in climate or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats sweeteners grains and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyberbased attacks we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns transaction errors or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyberbased attack could be significant 

further we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in addition certain of our processes rely on thirdparty cloud computing services if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies inaccurate financial reporting the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

we remain rooted in our basic beliefs of quality people ethics growth and independence established by our founder and namesake jerome smucker more than a century ago today these basic beliefs are the core of our unique corporate culture and serve as a foundation for decisionmaking and actions we have been led by five generations of family leadership having had only six chief executive officers in 123 years this continuity of management and thought extends to the broader leadership team that embodies the values and embraces the business practices that have contributed to our consistent growth our strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america 

our strategic growth objectives include increasing net sales by 2 to 3 percent and operating income excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted operating income” by 5 percent on average over the long term related to income per diluted share excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted earnings per share” our strategic growth objective is to achieve an average increase of 8 percent over the long term we expect organic growth including new products to drive much of our topline growth while the contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets integration and restructuring costs and unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information due to the unknown and potentially prolonged impact of covid19 we may experience difficulties or be delayed in achieving our longterm strategies however we continue to evaluate the effects from covid19 on our longterm growth objectives 

net sales has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 7 percent over the past five years while adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share have increased at a rate of 9 percent and 14 percent respectively over the same period these increases were primarily driven by the acquisitions of big heart in 2015 and ainsworth in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11 percent our cash deployment strategy is to balance reinvesting in our business through acquisitions and capital expenditures with returning cash to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and share repurchases our deployment strategy also includes a significant focus on debt repayment 

on may 14 2018 we acquired the equity of ainsworth in an allcash transaction which was funded by debt and valued at 19 billion ainsworth was a leading producer distributor and marketer of premium pet food and pet snacks predominantly within the us as anticipated we fully realized approximately 550 of annual cost synergies related to this acquisition by the end of 2020 

on august 31 2018 we sold our us baking business to brynwood partners vii lp and brynwood partners viii lp subsidiaries of brynwood partners an unrelated party the transaction included products that were primarily sold in us retail channels under the pillsbury  martha white  hungry jack  white lily  and jim dandy brands along with all relevant trademarks and licensing agreements and our manufacturing facility in toledo ohio this business generated net sales of approximately 3700 in 2018 primarily in the us retail consumer foods segment the transaction did not include our baking business in canada we received proceeds from the divestiture of 3695 which were net of cash transactions costs and included a working capital adjustment during 2019 we recognized a pretax gain of 277 related to this transaction which was included in other operating expense income – net within the statement of consolidated income 

covid19 

the continued spread of covid19 throughout the united states and the international community has had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business and industry 

we are committed to supporting our employees and communities while ensuring people and pets have access to a steady supply of food through the following initiatives 

• financial assistance provided to employees in the form of a 1500 hardship award to frontline employees up to 

12 weeks of full pay and benefits continuation for employees unable to perform their roles 14 days of paid sick leave to individuals with andor caring for family members with covid19 and an assistance fund seeded with 100000 to support employees significantly impacted 

• 100 percent payment of covid19 testing for employees and all virtual health screenings conducted by our insurance provider 

• reinforcement of mental health resources available to our employees 

• implementation of appropriate physical distancing guidelines and extensive additional sanitation measures and temperature screenings at all of our locations to prevent the spread of covid19 and keep employees safe 

• food and monetary donations to organizations including the red cross ®  feeding america ®  united way ®  rescue bank ® and the akroncanton regional foodbank and 

• 100 percent match of employee donations to more than 20 local and national charities 

we are working closely with our suppliers and customers and have been proactive in taking additional actions to ensure business continuity maximize product availability and minimize potential disruptions across our supply chain and operations we have increased production at all of our facilities and expanded the availability of appointments at distribution centers all of our production operations remain open and none have experienced significant disruptions or labor reductions related to covid19 furthermore we have successfully implemented measures to allocate order volumes to ensure a consistent supply across our retail partners during this high period of demand 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we experienced an increase in orders across our us and international retail businesses in response to the increased consumer demand for our products related to “stock up” shopping and increased athome consumption this benefit was partially offset by the incremental expenses incurred to support the previously mentioned initiatives which totaled approximately 130 the increase in consumer demand may partially reverse in the coming months as consumer purchasing behavior may change as a result of t he length and severity of the pandemic duration of physical distancing requirements stayathome orders and macroeconomic implications in addition if there is a second surge of the virus we may experience another temporary increase in orders however at the end of 2020 consumer demand and customer orders remain elevated compared to historical seasonal comparisons we have also experienced a decline in products sold in the away from home channels as a result of covid19 which has negatively impacted our net sales in our international and away from home reportable segment and we expect to continue to adversely affect our net sales while government restrictions and physical distancing measures are in place we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which covid19 will impact our business consolidated results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

results of operations 

this discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended april 30 2020 and 2019 for the comparisons of the years ended april 30 2019 and 2018 see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of our 2019 annual report on form 10k 



a we use nongaap financial measures to evaluate our performance refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure 

net sales 



amounts may not add due to rounding  

a net sales excluding acquisition divestiture and foreign currency exchange is a nongaap financial measure used to evaluate performance internally this measure provides useful information to investors because it enables comparison of results on a yearoveryear basis 

net sales in 2020 decreased 370 reflecting 1059 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the us baking business partially offset by incremental net sales in the current year of 254 related to the ainsworth acquisition net sales excluding acquisition divestiture and foreign currency exchange increased 503 or 1 percent favorable volumemix contributed 2 percentage points to net sales primarily driven by gains for the smucker’s dunkin’ milkbone  and meow mix brands reflecting approximately 1850 of incremental net sales resulting from increased consumer demand related to the covid19 pandemic these gains were partially offset by declines for private label dog food and the natural balance brand lower net price realization impacted net sales by 1 percentage point primarily due to lower net pricing for coffee and peanut butter 

operating income 

the following table presents the components of operating income as a percentage of net sales 



amounts may not add due to rounding 

gross profit increased 863 or 3 percent in 2020 primarily driven by a favorable net impact of lower prices and lower costs favorable volumemix and the noncomparable benefit of ainsworth partially offset by the noncomparable impact related to the us baking business divestiture the favorable net impact of price and cost was mostly driven by a favorable change in the impact of derivative gains and losses 

operating income increased 2945 or 32 percent primarily due to the 1527 decrease in intangible asset impairment charges a 476 decrease in special project costs a 343 decrease in selling distribution and administrative “sda” expenses and the increase in gross profit partially offset by the noncomparable impact of the 277 pretax gain related to the sale of the us baking business in the prior year during 2020 we recognized a noncash impairment charge of 524 associated with the natural balance brand within the us retail pet foods segment for additional information on this charge refer to “critical accounting estimates and policies” in this discussion and analysis 

our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets integration and restructuring costs and unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information gross profit excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted gross profit” was comparable to the prior year further reflecting an unfavorable change related to the exclusion of unallocated derivative gains and losses as compared to gaap gross profit adjusted operating income increased 164 or 1 percent as compared to the prior year further reflecting the exclusion of impairment charges and special project costs as compared to gaap operating income 

interest expense 

net interest expense decreased 187 or 9 percent in 2020 primarily as a result of reduced debt as compared to the prior year for additional information see “capital resources” in this discussion and analysis 

income taxes 

income taxes increased 600 or 32 percent in 2020 as compared to the prior year the effective tax rate of 241 percent for 2020 varied from the us statutory tax rate of 210 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes the effective tax rate of 267 percent for 2019 was also unfavorably impacted by the income tax expense associated with the sale of the us baking business and a goodwill impairment charge within the us retail consumer foods segment partially offset by a noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of ainsworth we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 240 percent for additional information refer to note 14 income taxes 

integration activities 

as of april 30 2020 all integration activities related to the acquisition of ainsworth were considered complete we have incurred total cumulative integration costs of 486 of which 165 was incurred in 2020 the majority of these costs were cash charges for additional information refer to note 3 integration and restructuring costs 

commodities overview 

the raw materials we use are primarily commodities agriculturalbased products and packaging materials the most significant of these materials based on 2020 annual spend are green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats and plastic containers green coffee and certain oils are traded on active regulated exchanges and the price of these commodities fluctuates based on market conditions derivative instruments including futures and options are used to minimize the impact of price volatility for these commodities 

we source green coffee from more than 20 coffeeproducing countries its price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries 

we source peanuts animal protein meals and oils and fats mainly from north america we are one of the largest procurers of peanuts in the us and frequently enter into longterm purchase contracts for various periods of time to mitigate the risk of a shortage of this commodity the oils we purchase are mainly soybean and canola the price of peanuts animal protein meals and oils are driven primarily by weather which impacts crop sizes and yield as well as global demand especially from large importing countries such as china and india in particular the supply chain for animal protein meals and fats has been significantly disrupted by the covid19 pandemic and therefore the price for these commodities has increased and may continue to increase due to such disruptions furthermore the price of peanuts has been impacted by the recent decrease in crop supply 

we frequently enter into longterm contracts to purchase plastic containers which are sourced mainly from within the us plastic resin is made from petrochemical feedstock and natural gas feedstock and the price can be influenced by feedstock energy and crude oil prices as well as global economic conditions 

excluding the impact of derivative gains and losses our overall commodity costs in 2020 were lower than in 2019 primarily due to lower costs for green coffee and peanuts 

segment results 

we have four reportable segments us retail pet foods us retail coffee us retail consumer foods and international and away from home the us retail pet foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of rachael ray nutrish  meow mix  milkbone  kibbles ’n bits  9lives  natural balance  nature’s recipe  and pupperoni branded products the us retail coffee segment primarily includes the domestic sales of folgers  dunkin’  and café bustelo branded coffee and the us retail consumer foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of smucker’s  jif  and crisco branded products the international and away from home segment comprises products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg health care operators restaurants lodging hospitality offices k12 colleges and universities and convenience stores 



us retail pet foods 

the us retail pet foods segment net sales decreased 100 in 2020 including the impact of two weeks of incremental ainsworth sales in the current year excluding the incremental ainsworth business net sales decreased 354 reflecting a 598 decline related to private label products volumemix decreased net sales by 2 percentage points primarily driven by declines for private label dog food and the natural balance brand partially offset by gains for the milkbone and meow mix brands which is reflective of the incremental net sales from stockup purchasing related to the covid19 pandemic net price realization contributed 1 percentage point primarily related to the meow mix and kibbles ’n bits brands partially offset by declines for the nutrish brand the higher net pricing is reflective of list price increases across most brands implemented during the second half of the prior year partially offset by increased trade spend segment profit increased 493 reflecting a 109 unfavorable fair value purchase accounting adjustment in the prior year and the benefit from the incremental ainsworth sales profit improvement was also driven by synergy realization reduced marketing expense higher net pricing and a recovery from a legal settlement related to a prior year supplier issue partially offset by an increase in sda expenses and higher input costs 

us retail coffee 

the us retail coffee segment net sales increased 272 in 2020 reflecting favorable volumemix partially offset by lower net price realization the favorable volumemix which increased net sales by 5 percentage points was driven by the dunkin’  folgers  and café bustelo brands reflecting the benefit of incremental net sales resulting from increased athome coffee consumption related to the covid19 pandemic lower net pricing which reduced net sales by 4 percentage points reflected promotional activity across all brands mostly supported by lower green coffee costs segment profit increased 147 primarily due to favorable volumemix and decreased marketing expense partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of lower net pricing and lower green coffee costs and an increase in sda expenses 

us retail consumer foods 

the us retail consumer foods segment net sales decreased 298 in 2020 driven by a 1022 noncomparable impact of the us baking business excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business net sales increased 4 percent favorable 

volumemix contributed 7 percentage points to net sales primarily related to growth for the smucker’s and jif brands reflecting the benefit of incremental net sales resulting from increased consumer demand related to the covid19 pandemic and the associated stayathome orders lower net price realization reduced net sales by 2 percentage points primarily driven by the list price decrease on the jif brand partially offset by decreased trade spend segment profit decreased 164 primarily reflecting 443 of segment profit in the prior year related to the divested business of which 277 represented the pretax gain related to the sale excluding the impact of the divestiture segment profit increased 8 percent driven primarily by the favorable volumemix and decreased marketing expense partially offset by the unfavorable net impact of lower pricing and lower input costs as well as a writeoff of equipment related to the discontinuation of jif power ups  

international and away from home 

the international and away from home segment net sales decreased 244 in 2020 including a noncomparable impact of 37 of net sales in the prior year related to the divested us baking business unfavorable volumemix reduced net sales by 1 percentage point primarily driven by declines for the folgers brand and increased shipments in the prior year related to the closing of facilities in mexico and transition to a distributor export model these declines were partially offset by gains for the smucker’s brand lower net price realization reduced net sales by 1 percentage point primarily related to the folgers brand foreign currency exchange had a 68 unfavorable impact on net sales segment profit decreased 251 primarily reflecting the unfavorable volumemix lower pricing and higher cost 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings against our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents increased to 3911 at april 30 2020 compared to 1013 at april 30 2019 

the following table presents selected cash flow information 



a free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure used by management to evaluate the amount of cash available for debt repayment dividend distribution acquisition opportunities share repurchases and other corporate purposes 

the 1136 increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily driven by higher net income adjusted for noncash items in the current year the cash required to fund working capital decreased compared to the prior year excluding the impact of the realization of a 300 income tax refund in 2019 the decrease in working capital requirements was primarily driven by lower payments for accounts payable items driven by working capital initiatives inclusive of a supplier financing program entered into during 2020 offsetting these decreases is a 2398 settlement of interest rate contracts during 2020 for additional information refer to note 10 derivative financial instruments 

cash used for investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of 2693 in capital expenditures cash used for investing activities in 2019 consisted of 19 billion related to the ainsworth acquisition 3598 in capital expenditures and a 298 increase in our derivative cash margin account balances partially offset by net proceeds from the divestiture of the us baking business of 3695 

cash used for financing activities in 2020 consisted primarily of longterm debt repayments of 9000 dividend payments of 3968 and a 1858 net reduction in shortterm borrowings partially offset by 7982 in longterm debt proceeds cash provided by financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of 15 billion in longterm debt proceeds and a 2820 net increase in shortterm borrowings partially offset by longterm debt repayments of 7000 and dividend payments of 3779 

supplier financing program 

as part of ongoing efforts to maximize working capital we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which includes the extension of payment terms payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable generally range from 0 to 120 days during 2020 we entered into an agreement with a thirdparty administrator to provide an accounts payable tracking system and facilitate a supplier financing program which allows participating suppliers the ability to monitor and voluntarily elect to sell our payment obligations to a designated thirdparty financial institution participating suppliers can sell one or more of our payment obligations at their sole discretion and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under these arrangements as of april 30 2020 1575 of our outstanding payment obligations were elected and sold to a financial institution by participating suppliers during 2020 we paid 318 to a financial institution for payment obligations that were settled through the supplier financing program 

contingencies 

we like other food manufacturers are from time to time subject to various administrative regulatory and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business we are currently a defendant in a variety of such legal proceedings including certain lawsuits related to the alleged pricefixing of shelf stable tuna products prior to 2011 by a business previously owned by but divested prior to our acquisition of big heart the significant majority of which were settled and paid during the second half of 2019 while we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of these proceedings or potential settlements associated with these or other matters we have accrued losses for certain contingent liabilities that we have determined are probable and reasonably estimable at april 30 2020 based on the information known to date with the exception of the matter discussed below we do not believe the final outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to the legal proceedings discussed above we are currently a defendant in cert v brad barry llc et al which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants who manufacture package distribute or sell coffee failed to provide warnings for our coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under proposition 65 as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit we dispute these claims acrylamide is not added to coffee but is inherently present in all coffee in small amounts measured in parts per billion as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process the outcome and the financial impact of the case if any cannot be predicted at this time accordingly no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter as of april 30 2020 as the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable however if we are required to pay significant statutory penalties or to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 our business and financial results could be adversely impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere for additional information see note 16 contingencies 

capital resources 

the following table presents our capital structure 



in march 2020 we completed an offering of 5000 and 3000 in senior notes due march 15 2030 and march 15 2050 respectively a portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repay the 5000 senior notes due march 15 2020 with the balance being held as a cash equivalent to be used for general corporate purposes 

in april 2018 we entered into a senior unsecured delayeddraw term loan credit agreement “term loan” with a syndicate of banks and an available commitment amount of 15 billion the full amount of the term loan was drawn on may 14 2018 to partially finance the ainsworth acquisition borrowings under the term loan bear interest on the prevailing us prime rate or libor based on our election and is payable either on a quarterly basis or at the end of the borrowing term the term loan matures on may 14 2021 and does not require scheduled amortization payments voluntary prepayments are permitted without premium or penalty as of april 30 2020 we have prepaid 8000 on the term loan to 

date including 1000 in 2020 the interest rate on the term loan at april 30 2020 was 121 percent in november 2019 we entered into an amendment to the term loan that decreased the applicable margins on libor based on our longterm unsecured debt rating this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we have available a 18 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks that matures in september 2022 additionally we participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper not to exceed 18 billion at any time the commercial paper program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces what we can borrow under the revolving credit facility by the amount of commercial paper outstanding commercial paper will be used as a continuing source of shortterm financing for general corporate purposes as of april 30 2020 we had 2480 of shortterm borrowings outstanding all of which were issued under our commercial paper program at a weightedaverage interest rate of 040 percent 

we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information on our longterm debt sources of liquidity and debt covenants see note 8 debt and financing arrangements 

during 2020 we did not repurchase any common shares under a repurchase plan authorized by the board at april 30 2020 approximately 36 million common shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to the board’s authorizations there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that may be repurchased or when such purchases may occur 

the following table presents certain cash requirements related to 2021 investing and financing activities based on our current expectations although no principal payments are required on our debt obligations in 2021 we may utilize a portion of our cash for debt repayment additionally in 2022 a portion of our senior notes will mature and 19 billion in principal payments will be required that year 



absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments we believe that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operations borrowings available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months including the payment of quarterly dividends capital expenditures and interest payments on debt outstanding however as a result of covid19 we may experience an increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future which could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities 

during 2020 we returned 397 of international cash to the us primarily driven by a reduction in our capital investment in certain foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with a restructuring of our international holding and operating entities no foreign withholding taxes were applicable and the state income taxes were not significant as of april 30 2020 total cash and cash equivalents of 839 was held by our foreign subsidiaries primarily in canada the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial measures including net sales excluding acquisition divestiture and foreign currency exchange adjusted gross profit adjusted operating income adjusted income adjusted earnings per share earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and impairment charges related to intangible assets “ebitda as adjusted” and free cash flow as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures furthermore these nongaap financial measures are used by management in preparation of the annual budget and for the monthly analyses of our operating results the board of directors also utilizes certain nongaap financial measures as components for measuring performance for incentive compensation purposes 

nongaap financial measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results which include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets integration and restructuring costs “special project costs” and unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives “unallocated derivative gains and losses” as well as the related tax impacts of these exclusions the special project costs in the following table relate to specific integration and restructuring projects and the unallocated derivative gains and losses reflect the changes in fair value of our commodity and foreign currency exchange contracts additionally income taxes as adjusted is calculated using an adjusted effective income tax rate that is applied to adjusted income before income taxes while this adjusted effective income tax rate does not generally differ materially from our gaap effective tax rate certain exclusions from nongaap results can significantly impact our adjusted effective income tax rate 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with us gaap rather the presentation of these nongaap financial measures supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and liquidity these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments 

the following table reconciles certain nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measure see 

page 22 for a reconciliation of net sales adjusted for certain noncomparable items to the comparable gaap financial measure 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have material offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons also known as variable interest entities transactions with related parties are in the ordinary course of business and are not material to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations by fiscal year at april 30 2020 



a longterm debt obligations including current portion excludes the impact of offering discounts makewhole payments and debt issuance costs 

b interest payments consists of the interest payments on our longterm debt which reflect estimated payments for our variablerate debt based on the current interest rate outlook 

c operating lease obligations consists of the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

d purchase obligations includes agreements that are enforceable and legally bind us to purchase goods or services which primarily consist of obligations related to normal ongoing purchase obligations in which we have guaranteed payment to ensure availability of raw materials we expect to receive consideration for these purchase obligations in the form of materials and services these purchase obligations do not represent all future purchases expected but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated amounts included in the table above represent our current best estimate of payments due actual cash payments may vary due to the variable pricing components of certain purchase obligations 

e other liabilities consists primarily of projected commitments associated with our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as well as 60 related to financing lease obligations the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and taxrelated net interest of 150 under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes  is excluded since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates 

trade marketing and merchandising programs in order to support our products various promotional activities are conducted through retail distributors or directly with consumers including instore display and product placement programs price discounts coupons and other similar activities the costs of these programs are classified as a reduction of sales we regularly review and revise when we deem necessary estimates of costs for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retail distributors or consumers these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expenditures and actual performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period during 2020 2019 and 2018 subsequent period adjustments were less than 2 percent of both consolidated pretax income and cash provided by operating activities these promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of sales represented 39 percent of net sales in 2020 the possibility exists that reported results could be different if factors such as the level and success of the promotional programs or other conditions differ from expectations 

  

income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to uncertainties related to tax filing positions and periodically assess the technical merits of these tax positions for all tax years that remain subject to examination based upon the latest information available for material uncertain tax positions we have recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits including any applicable interest and penalty charges 

we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and projected future taxable income levels changes in estimated realization of deferred tax assets would result in an adjustment to income in the period in which that determination is made unless such changes are determined to be an adjustment to goodwill within the allowable measurement period under the acquisition method of accounting 

the future tax benefit arising from the net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was 2448 and 1636 at april 30 2020 and 2019 respectively in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and results of operations for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance would have been provided 

as of april 30 2020 the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries primarily in canada remain permanently reinvested 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2020 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 127 billion compared to total assets of 170 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 82 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a marketbased approach the impairment test incorporates estimates of future cash flows allocations of certain assets liabilities and cash flows among reporting units future growth rates terminal value amounts and the applicable weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows the estimates and projections used in the calculation of fair value are consistent with our current and longrange plans including anticipated changes in market conditions industry trends growth rates and planned capital expenditures changes in forecasted operations and other estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2020 goodwill totaled 63 billion goodwill is substantially concentrated within the us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments during 2020 no goodwill impairment was recognized as a result of the evaluations performed throughout the year the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units for which there is a goodwill balance was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date with the exception of the pet foods reporting unit for which its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3 percent a sensitivity analysis was performed for the pet foods reporting unit assuming a hypothetical 50basispoint decrease in the expected longterm growth rate or a hypothetical 50basispoint increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the pet foods reporting unit below carrying value 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consisting entirely of trademarks are also tested for impairment at least annually and more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable to test these assets for impairment we estimate the fair value of each asset based on a discounted cash flow model using various inputs including projected revenues an assumed royalty rate and a discount rate changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2020 other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 29 billion trademarks that represent our leading brands comprise approximately 90 percent of the total carrying value of other indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2020 

the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of these leading brand trademarks and in all instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent with the exception of the rachael ray nutrish brand within the us retail pet foods segment during 2020 we recognized an impairment charge of 524 related to the natural balance brand within the us retail pet foods segment representing the extent to which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value we reassessed the longterm strategic expectations for the natural balance brand and reclassified this brand as a finitelived intangible asset as of february 1 2020 

the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the us retail pet foods segment were 

24 billion and 14 billion respectively as of april 30 2020 these intangible assets remain susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value which is primarily attributable to recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in may 2018 any significant adverse change in our near or longterm projections or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment charges which could be material 

furthermore we continue to evaluate the potential impact of covid19 on the fair value of our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets while we concluded there were no indicators of impairment as of april 30 2020 any significant sustained adverse change in consumer purchasing behaviors government restrictions financial results or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impairment specifically as it relates to the away from home reporting unit which has experienced a significant decline in demand as a result of covid19 as of april 30 2020 the goodwill related to the away from home reporting unit represented approximately 65 percent of the goodwill within the international and away from home segment for additional information see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine the ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works various actuarial assumptions must be made in order to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date the most significant being the interest rates used to discount the obligations of the plans the longterm rates of return on the plans’ assets mortality assumptions assumed pay increases and the health care cost trend rates we along with thirdparty actuaries and investment managers review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 

we utilize a spot rate methodology for the estimation of service and interest cost for our plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows to provide a better estimate of service and interest costs for 2021 expense recognition we will use weightedaverage discount rates for the us defined benefit pension plans of 305 percent to determine benefit obligation 334 percent to determine service cost and 254 percent to determine interest cost and a rate of compensation increase of 358 percent for the canadian defined benefit pension plans we will use weightedaverage discount rates of 295 percent to determine benefit obligation 306 percent to determine service cost and 247 percent to determine interest cost and a rate of compensation increase of 300 percent in addition we anticipate using an expected rate of return on plan assets of 496 percent and 300 percent for the us and canadian defined benefit pension plans respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

derivative financial instruments and market risk 

the following discussions about our market risk disclosures involve forwardlooking statements actual results could differ from those projected in the forwardlooking statements we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at april 30 2020 approximates carrying value we are exposed to interest rate risk with regard to existing debt consisting of fixed and variablerate maturities our interest rate exposure primarily includes us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the us the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom has stated that it will not require banks to submit libor beyond 2021 we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position as a result of this action given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt 

we utilize derivative instruments to manage interest risk associated with anticipated debt transactions as well as to manage changes in the fair value of our longterm debt at the inception of an interest rate contract the instrument is evaluated and documented for qualifying hedge accounting treatment if the contract is designated as a cash flow hedge the marktomarket gains or losses on the contract are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to interest expense in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings if the contract is designated as a fair value hedge the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense generally changes in the fair value of the contract are equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no net impact on earnings 

we entered into interest rate contracts in november 2018 and june 2018 with notional values of 3000 and 5000 respectively to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with anticipated debt financing in 2020 these 

interest rate contracts were designated as cash flow hedges in march 2020 we terminated the interest rate contracts 

concurrent with the pricing of the senior notes due march 15 2030 and march 15 2050 which resulted in a pretax loss of  2398  the loss was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt 

in 2015 we terminated the interest rate swap on the senior notes due october 15 2021 which was designated as a fair value hedge and used to hedge against the changes in the fair value of the debt as a result of the early termination we received  581 in cash which included  46 of accrued and prepaid interest and a 535 benefit that is deferred as a component of the carrying value of the longterm debt and is being recognized ratably as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt at april 30 2020 the remaining benefit of 124 was recorded as an increase in the longterm debt balance 

in measuring interest rate risk by the amount of net change in the fair value of our financial liabilities a hypothetical 

100basispoint decrease in interest rates at april 30 2020 would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by 4166 

foreign currency exchange risk we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily denominated in canadian currency because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities financial exposure may result primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of april 30 2020 are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or 

cash flows 

we utilize foreign currency derivatives to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials and finished goods the contracts generally have maturities of less than one year we do not qualify instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold based on our hedged foreign currency positions as of april 30 2020 a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates would not materially impact the fair value 

revenues from customers outside the us subject to foreign currency exchange represented 6 percent of net sales during 2020 thus certain revenues and expenses have been and are expected to be subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results 

commodity price risk we use certain raw materials and other commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by supply and demand conditions political and economic variables weather investor speculation and other unpredictable factors to manage the volatility related to anticipated commodity purchases we use derivatives with maturities of generally less than one year we do not qualify commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment as a result the gains and losses on all commodity derivatives are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 

the following sensitivity analysis presents our potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent change in market prices related to commodities 



the estimated fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity for the previous four quarters the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur in practice as markets move we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate the commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative instrument thus we would expect that any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of these derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e or 15d15e under the exchange act as of april 30 2020 the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is 1 recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and 2 accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

we have four reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods us retail pet foods and international and away from home the us retail market segments in total comprised 86 percent of 2019  consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america the international and away from home segment represents sales outside of the us retail market segments 

principal products  our principal products as of april 30 2019  are coffee dog food pet snacks cat food peanut butter fruit spreads frozen handheld products shortening and oils portion control products juices and beverages and flour and baking ingredients product sales information for the years 2019  2018  and 2017  is included within note 5 reportable segments 

in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers club stores pet specialty stores discount and dollar stores food wholesalers online retailers drug stores natural foods stores and distributors military commissaries and mass merchandisers in the international and away from home segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats sweeteners grains fruit and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures options and fixed price contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source peanuts animal protein meals and oils and fats mainly from north america the principal packaging materials we use are plastic glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate   for additional information on the commodities we 

purchase see “commodities overview” within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing 

trademarks and patents  our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries our major trademarks as of april 30 2019  are listed below 



dunkin’ donuts  is a registered trademark of dd ip holder llc used under two licenses the “dunkin’ licenses” for packaged coffee products including kcup ®  pods sold in retail channels such as grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores and drug stores the dunkin’ licenses do not pertain to dunkin’ donuts  coffee or other products for sale in dunkin’ donuts  restaurants the terms of the dunkin’ licenses include the payment of royalties to an affiliate of dd ip holder llc and other financial commitments by the company the dunkin’ licenses are in effect until january 1 2039

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments have historically been seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally resulted in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the fall bake and holiday period has had a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the back to school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods 

as a result of the us baking business divestiture during the second quarter of 2019 we expect that the us retail consumer foods segment will experience less seasonality additionally the us retail pet foods segment which grew during 2019 as a result of the ainsworth acquisition during the first quarter does not experience significant seasonality further reducing the overall impact of seasonality to the total company 

working capital  working capital requirements have historically been greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil and baking inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season the impact of seasonality on our overall working capital requirements has been partially reduced by the us retail pet foods segment which does not 

experience significant seasonality the divestiture of the us baking business and the acquisition of ainsworth during 2019 are expected to reduce the seasonality of our overall working capital requirements 

customers sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 32  percent 31  percent and 30  percent of net sales in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2019  2018  or 2017  

during 2019  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  we are the branded market leader in the coffee dog snacks peanut butter fruit spreads natural shelf stable juices shortening and ice cream toppings categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles fruit spreads canned milk shortening and ice cream toppings categories   our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the growth of certain retail channels such as the 

ecommerce market the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty in our total us retail categories private label held a 166 dollar average market share during the 52 weeks ended april 21 2019 as compared to a 164 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

our primary brands and major competitors as of april 30 2019  are listed below 

a identifies the current market leader within the product category in certain categories the market leader is not identified as two or more brands compete for the largest share 

b  crisco  is the market leader within the shortening category in the oils category private label brands collectively maintain the largest share 

environmental matters  compliance with environmental regulations and environmental sustainability is a key strategic focus as we consider it to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen we have public goals related to waste diversion water usage intensity reduction and greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction we have implemented and manage a variety of programs across our operations including energy optimization the utilization of renewable energy water conservation the reuse of resources and the support of farmers who implement sustainable practices in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2020 

employees  at april 30 2019  we had approximately 7400 fulltime employees worldwide of which 24  percent located at nine  manufacturing locations are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on location with seven  contracts expiring in 2020 representing 19  percent of our total employees we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   

we may be unable to grow market share of our products 

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

our proprietary brands packaging designs and manufacturing methods are essential to the value of our business and the inability to protect these could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as our aromaseal ™  canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us could adversely affect our business 

we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to fail to perform brokerage services or to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

loss or interruption of supply from singlesource suppliers of raw materials and finished goods could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers  coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and crisco  oil products and finished goods such as kcup ®  pods and our pupperoni  dog snacks from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ®  pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ®  kcup ®  brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ®  pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be adversely impacted as a result of increased cost limited availability andor insufficient quality of raw materials including commodities and agricultural products 

we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats sweeteners grains and fruit in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in addition we compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher costs for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures options and fixed price contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability as compared to that of our competitors in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our efforts to manage commodity foreign currency exchange and other price volatility through derivative instruments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

we may be limited in our ability to pass cost increases on to our customers in the form of price increases or may realize a decrease in sales volume to the extent price increases are implemented 

we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

certain of our products are produced at single manufacturing sites 

we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products into single manufacturing sites including substantially all of our coffee milkbone  dog snacks fruit spreads toppings and syrups we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant interruption in the operation of any of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events additionally some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes or wildfires can frequently occur such as alabama kansas and california failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages 

as of april 30 2019  24  percent of our fulltime employees located at nine  manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with seven  contracts expiring in 2020 representing 19  percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to competitively serve customers depends on the availability of reliable transportation increases in logistics and other transportationrelated costs could adversely impact our results of operations 

logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry 

the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss of our largest customer could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 32  percent of net sales in 2019  these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2019  included amounts due from walmart inc and subsidiaries of 1377  million or 27 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2019  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the competitive food industry and continued demand for our products may be affected by our failure to effectively compete or by changes in consumer preferences 

we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs in particular technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets we are committed to expanding our presence in ecommerce transforming our manufacturing commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and enhancing our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights however if we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding ecommerce market adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights our business performance may be impacted which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 

some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new 

products introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through investment in innovation will be less successful in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

the success of our business depends substantially on consumer perceptions of our brands 

we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior products we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the dunkin’ donuts  or rachael ray  brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

we could be subject to adverse publicity or claims from consumers 

certain of our products contain ingredients which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts an unfavorable report on the effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation could influence consumer preferences significantly reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to attract develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business 

we depend on the skills and continued service of key employees including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify recruit hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented people and we may lose key employees or fail to attract recruit train develop and retain other talented individuals any such loss failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results in addition activities related to identifying recruiting hiring integrating and training qualified individuals may require significant time and expense we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures specifically we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the ainsworth acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses including ainsworth and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the 

anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses including the sale of our us baking business and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses including the effective management of the related separation and stranded overhead costs our business and financial results could be negatively impacted 

we may not realize the benefits we expect from our cost reduction and other cash management initiatives 

we continuously pursue initiatives to reduce costs increase effectiveness and optimize cash flow we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale any failure to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings or disruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital in the future 

we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our substantial debt obligations could restrict our operations and financial condition additionally our ability to generate cash to make payments on our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of april 30 2019  we had approximately 59 billion  of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt partially as a result of new borrowings this year to finance the ainsworth acquisition we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences including 



 our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt 

a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 

a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at 

april 30 2019  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 130 billion compared to total assets of 

167 billion  and total shareholders’ equity of 80 billion  if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset would be considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings which could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

as of april 30 2019 the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the us retail pet foods segment were 24  billion and 15  billion respectively these intangible assets are susceptible to future impairment charges due to narrow differences between fair value and carrying value as a result of recent impairment charges and the acquisition of ainsworth in may 2018 to date we have recognized 4126 million of impairment charges related to the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets acquired as part of the big heart acquisition in 2015 primarily as a result of reductions in our longterm net sales and profitability projections we do not believe that our pet foods reporting unit or any of the indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment are more likely than not impaired as of 

april 30 2019 however further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the us retail pet foods segment or its brands an adverse change to macroeconomic conditions or a change to other assumptions could result in additional impairment losses in the future which could be significant as of april 30 2019 the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of the remaining reporting units and material indefinitelived intangible assets and in all instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent with the exception of the natural foods reporting unit which has no remaining goodwill as a result of the impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019 for further information refer to note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

changes in tax environmental or other regulations and laws or their application or failure to comply with existing licensing trade and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling distribution and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety data privacy and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986  better known as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products as well as civil penalties the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement in particular we are currently a defendant in council for education and research on toxics “plaintiff” or “cert” v brad barry llc et al which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants who manufacture package distribute or sell packaged coffee failed to warn persons in california that our coffee products expose persons to the chemical acrylamide which is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts measured in parts per billion as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process in violation of proposition 65 if we are required to pay significant statutory penalties or to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 our business and financial results could be adversely impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

we regularly move data across national and state borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and state to state and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures and potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our operations in certain developing markets expose us to regulatory risks 

in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in climate or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats sweeteners grains and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face 

increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect such information technology systems against data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats therefore we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact we invest in industry standard security technology to protect our data and business processes against the risk of data security breaches and cyberbased attacks we believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks nevertheless despite continued vigilance in these areas security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns transaction errors or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information in addition the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyberbased attack could be significant 

further we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in addition certain of our processes rely on thirdparty cloud computing services if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies inaccurate financial reporting the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

we have four reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods us retail pet foods and international and away from home the us retail market segments in total comprised 86 percent of net sales in 2019  and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america in the us retail market segments our products are sold primarily to food retailers club stores pet specialty stores discount and dollar stores food wholesalers online retailers drug stores natural foods stores and distributors military commissaries and mass merchandisers the products included in the international and away from home segment are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators 

strategic overview 

we remain rooted in our basic beliefs of quality people ethics growth  and independence  established by our founder and namesake jerome smucker more than a century ago today these basic beliefs  are the core of our unique corporate culture and serve as a foundation for decisionmaking and actions we have been led by five generations of family leadership having had only six chief executive officers in 122 years this continuity of management and thought extends to the broader leadership team that embodies the values and embraces the business practices that have contributed to our consistent growth our strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america 

our strategic longterm growth objectives are to increase net sales by 2 to 3 percent and operating income excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted operating income” by 5 percent annually on average our longterm growth objective related to income per diluted share excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted earnings per share” is to achieve an average increase of 8 percent annually we expect organic growth including new products to drive much of our topline growth while the contribution from acquisitions will vary from year to year our nongaap adjustments include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets integration and restructuring costs unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives and beginning in 2018 certain onetime discrete tax adjustments refer to “nongaap financial measures” in this discussion and analysis for further information 

net sales has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 7 percent over the past five years driven by the acquisitions of 

big heart in 2015 and ainsworth in the current year while adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share have increased at a rate of 7 percent and 6 percent respectively over the same period net cash provided by operating activities has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent our cash deployment strategy is to balance reinvesting in our business through acquisitions and capital expenditures with returning cash to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and share repurchases our strategy also includes a significant focus on debt repayment 

on may 14 2018 we acquired the stock of ainsworth in an allcash transaction which was funded by debt and valued at 19 billion  inclusive of a working capital adjustment ainsworth is a leading producer distributor and marketer of premium pet food and pet snacks predominantly within the us the majority of ainsworth’s sales are generated by the rachael ray nutrish brand which is driving significant growth in the premium pet food category annual cost synergies of approximately 550 are expected to be fully realized by the end of 2021 most of which will be achieved by the end of 2020 we realized synergies of 235 in 2019 the transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the results of ainsworth’s operations including 7470  and 408  in net sales and operating income respectively are included in our consolidated financial statements in 2019 

on august 31 2018 we sold our us baking business to brynwood partners vii lp and brynwood partners viii lp subsidiaries of brynwood partners an unrelated party the transaction included products that were primarily sold in us retail channels under the pillsbury  martha white  hungry jack  white lily  and jim dandy  brands along with all relevant trademarks and licensing agreements and our manufacturing facility in toledo ohio this business generated net sales of approximately 3700 in 2018 primarily in the us retail consumer foods segment the transaction did not include our baking business in canada we received proceeds from the divestiture of 3695  which were net of cash transactions costs and a working capital adjustment upon completion of the transaction we recognized a pretax gain of 277  during 2019 which is included in other operating expense income – net within the statement of consolidated income 

results of operations 

this discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended april 30 2019 and 2018 for the comparisons of the years ended april 30 2018 and 2017 see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of our 2018 annual report on form 10k 



 

net sales 



amounts may not add due to rounding  

 

net sales in 2019 increased 4809  or 7 percent  reflecting a 7470  contribution from the ainsworth acquisition partially offset by the impact of 2540  of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divestiture of the us baking business during the second quarter of 2019 net sales excluding acquisition divestiture and foreign currency exchange was comparable to the prior year as the impact of lower net price realization which reduced net sales by 1 percentage point was offset by the impact of favorable volumemix which contributed 1 percentage point to net sales the lower net price 

realization was mostly related to coffee peanut butter and oils and the favorable volumemix was primarily driven by growth in coffee smucker’s uncrustables  and jif   powerups tm  partially offset by a decline in pet food and pet snacks 

operating income 

the following table presents the components of operating income as a percentage of net sales 



amounts may not add due to rounding 

gross profit increased 796 or 3 percent in 2019 primarily driven by the addition of ainsworth partially offset by the noncomparable impact related to the us baking business divestiture an unfavorable net impact of lower prices and higher costs was mostly driven by an unfavorable change in the impact of derivative gains and losses which was partially offset by the impact of favorable volumemix 

operating income decreased 1154 or 11 percent as higher gross profit and a 277 pretax gain related to the sale of the us baking business were more than offset by a 1457 increase in selling distribution and administrative expenses and a 335 increase in amortization expense both of which were primarily due to the ainsworth acquisition in addition intangible asset impairment charges increased by 282 as a result of charges in the us retail pet foods and us retail consumer foods segments in 2019 and special project costs increased by 148 driven by an increase in restructuring costs for further information on the impairment charges refer to “critical accounting estimates and policies” in this discussion and analysis 

gross profit excluding nongaap adjustments “adjusted gross profit” increased 1672 or 6 percent in 2019 with the primary difference from gaap results being the exclusion of a 915 unfavorable change in the impact of unallocated derivative gains and losses as compared to the prior year adjusted operating income increased 526 or 4 percent further reflecting the exclusion of amortization expense the impairment charges and special project costs 

interest expense 

net interest expense increased 338 or 19 percent in 2019 primarily due to the impact of the incremental debt issued to finance the ainsworth acquisition for additional information see “capital resources” in this discussion and analysis 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate of 267 percent for 2019 varied from the us statutory tax rate of 210 percent primarily due to the impact of state income taxes additional income tax expense associated with the sale of the us baking business and a goodwill impairment charge within the us retail consumer foods segment partially offset by a noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of ainsworth 

income tax expense of 1872  for 2019 reflects an immaterial adjustment related to the completion of the accounting for the income tax effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “act” during the third quarter despite the completion of the accounting the amounts recorded may change as a result of future guidance and interpretation from the internal revenue service and various other taxing jurisdictions all of which are continuing to analyze the complexities and interdependencies 

of the provisions of the act any future legislative and interpretive actions could result in additional income tax impacts which could be material in the period any such changes are enacted we anticipate a fullyear effective tax rate for 2020 in the range of 245 to 250 percent 

the income tax benefit of 4776 for 2018 reflected the recognition of a net benefit of 7658 related to our discrete adjustments resulting directly from the act partially offset by additional income tax expense related to a pet foods reporting unit goodwill impairment charge the net benefit of 7658 included the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at the reduced federal income tax rate offset in part by the estimated impact of a onetime repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred for further information refer to note 13 income taxes 

integration activities 

we expect to incur approximately 500  in integration costs related to the ainsworth acquisition the majority of which are expected to be cash charges of the total anticipated integration costs we expect approximately half to be employeerelated during 2019 we incurred integration charges of 321  all remaining integration costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2020 for further information refer to note 3 integration and restructuring costs 

restructuring activities 

an organization optimization program was approved by the board of directors the “board” during the fourth quarter of 2016 under this program we identified opportunities to reduce costs and optimize the organization related projects included an organizational redesign and the optimization of our manufacturing footprint the program was expanded at the end of 2018 to include the restructuring of our geographic footprint which includes the centralization of our pet food and pet snacks business as well as certain international nonmanufacturing functions to our corporate headquarters in orrville ohio furthering collaboration and enhanced agility while improving cost efficiency 

the organization optimization program was completed during 2019 and as a result we closed our international offices in china and mexico as well as the san francisco and burbank california offices we incurred total cumulative restructuring costs of 746  of which 320  was incurred during 2019 the costs incurred were primarily employeerelated as the program resulted in total headcount reductions of approximately 450 fulltime positions for further information refer to note 3 integration and restructuring costs 

commodities overview 

the raw materials we use are primarily commodities agriculturalbased products and packaging materials the most significant of these materials based on 2019 annual spend are green coffee peanuts animal protein meals oils and fats and plastic containers green coffee and certain oils are traded on active regulated exchanges and the price of these commodities fluctuates based on market conditions derivative instruments including futures and options are used to minimize the impact of price volatility for these commodities 

we source green coffee from more than 20 coffeeproducing countries its price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries 

we source peanuts animal protein meals and oils and fats mainly from north america we are one of the largest procurers of peanuts in the us and frequently enter into longterm purchase contracts for various periods of time to mitigate the risk of a shortage of this commodity the oils we purchase are mainly soybean and canola the price of peanuts animal protein meals and oils are driven primarily by weather which impacts crop sizes and yield as well as global demand especially from large importing countries such as china and india in addition the price of oils has been impacted by demand from the biofuels industry 

we frequently enter into longterm contracts to purchase plastic containers which are sourced mainly from within the us plastic resin is made from petrochemical feedstock and natural gas feedstock and the price can be influenced by feedstock energy and crude oil prices as well as global economic conditions 

excluding the impact of derivative gains and losses our overall commodity costs in 2019 were lower than in 2018 primarily due to lower costs for green coffee slightly offset by higher costs for peanuts 

segment results 

we have four reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods us retail pet foods and international and away from home the us retail coffee segment primarily includes the domestic sales of folgers  dunkin’ donuts  

and café bustelo branded coffee the us retail consumer foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of smucker’s  jif  and crisco branded products and the us retail pet foods segment primarily includes domestic sales of rachael ray nutrish  meow mix  milkbone  natural balance  kibbles ’n bits  9lives  nature’s recipe  and pupperoni  branded products the international and away from home segment comprises products distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators 

effective may 1 2018 the convenience store channel which was previously included in the us retail segments is now included in the international and away from home segment segment performance for 2018 has been reclassified for this realignment 



us retail coffee 

the us retail coffee segment net sales increased 355 in 2019 favorable volumemix contributed 4 percentage points driven by the dunkin’ donuts  1850  and café bustelo brands partially offset by declines in folgers roast and ground coffee the favorable volumemix was partially offset by lower net price realization which reduced net sales by 2 percentage points primarily driven by the folgers brand segment profit increased 639 primarily due to lower input costs and favorable volumemix partially offset by lower net price realization and an increase in marketing expense the majority of which related to the 1850 launch 

us retail consumer foods 

the us retail consumer foods segment net sales decreased 2241 in 2019 reflecting the impact of 2473 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divested us baking business excluding the noncomparable impact of the divested business net sales increased 1 percent driven by favorable volumemix which contributed 4 percentage points primarily related to smucker’s uncrustables  jif powerups  and crisco  oils the favorable volumemix was partially offset by lower net price realization which reduced net sales by 2 percentage points driven by the jif  brand and a price decline on the crisco brand at the beginning of the fiscal year segment profit decreased 692 and decreased 552 excluding the noncomparable segment profit in the prior year and the gain from the divestiture the segment profit decline primarily resulted from lower net price realization and higher input costs mostly related to peanut butter and an increase in marketing expense driven by jif powerups  these factors were partially offset by the impact of favorable volumemix in response to an anticipated decline in our peanut costs we implemented a list price decrease on select jif products sold in the us effective march 2019 although not reflected in segment profit a goodwill impairment charge of 979  related to the natural foods reporting unit within the us retail consumer foods segment was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 for additional information see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

us retail pet foods 

the us retail pet foods segment net sales increased 7142 in 2019 reflecting the 7470  contribution from ainsworth excluding ainsworth net sales declined 328 primarily due to unfavorable volumemix which reduced net sales by 

2 percentage points the impact of the discontinuation of certain private label and gravy train ® wet dog food products and declines for the natural balance brand were partially offset by gains for the meow mix and nature’s recipe brands segment profit increased 640 driven by the addition of ainsworth excluding ainsworth segment profit decreased 291 as the impact of higher input costs was only partially offset by a reduction in marketing expense in response to a sustained increase in input costs we implemented a list price increase on select pet food products sold in the us effective february 2019 although not reflected in segment profit an impairment charge of 1072 associated with certain indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment was recognized in the third quarter of 2019 while the prior year included impairment charges of 1769 related to the goodwill of the pet foods reporting unit and certain indefinitelived trademarks within the segment for additional information see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

international and away from home 

the international and away from home segment net sales decreased 447 in 2019 due to lower net price realization 137 of unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable volumemix each of which reduced net sales by 1 percentage point the net sales decline also reflects the impact of 67 of noncomparable net sales in the prior year related to the divested us baking business segment profit decreased 16 reflecting lower net price realization the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and unfavorable volumemix which were offset by the impacts of lower input costs and lower marketing expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity 

our principal source of funds is cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings against our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility total cash and cash equivalents decreased to  1013  at april 30 2019  compared to  1926  at april 30 2018  

within the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments we have historically experienced a significant use of cash to fund working capital requirements during the first half of each fiscal year primarily due to the buildup of inventories to support the fall bake and holiday period the additional increase of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season and seasonal fruit procurement in these businesses cash provided by operations in the second half of the fiscal year has significantly exceeded the amount in the first half of the year upon completion of the fall bake and holiday period in contrast the us retail pet foods segment has not experienced significant seasonality 

due to the divestiture of the seasonal us baking business during the second quarter of 2019 we expect that the impact of seasonality on our future working capital requirements will be reduced further we anticipate that the growth of the us retail pet foods segment as a result of the ainsworth acquisition during the first quarter of 2019 will cause a further reduction in the seasonality of our overall working capital requirements 

the following table presents selected cash flow information 



 the 768 decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was mainly due to lower net income adjusted for noncash items the reduction in working capital during the current year was comparable to the prior year as an unfavorable impact related to trade receivables was mostly offset by a favorable impact related to income taxes trade receivables increased during the current year as a result of higher sales while trade receivables decreased during the prior year the favorable impact related to income taxes was due to lower federal payments and a 300 income tax refund during 2019 the lower federal payments in the current year were driven by the reduced statutory tax rate that resulted from us tax reform 

cash used for investing activities in 2019 consisted of 19 billion related to the ainsworth acquisition 3598 in capital expenditures and a 298 increase in our derivative cash margin account balances partially offset by net proceeds from the divestiture of the us baking business of 3695 cash used for investing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of 3219 in capital expenditures partially offset by a 309 reduction in our derivative cash margin account balances 

cash provided by financing activities in 2019 consisted primarily of 15 billion in longterm debt proceeds and a 2820 net increase in shortterm borrowings partially offset by longterm debt repayments of 7000 and dividend payments of 3779 for additional information on our new borrowings see “capital resources” in this discussion and analysis cash used for financing activities in 2018 consisted primarily of 11 billion in longterm debt repayments dividend payments of 3503 and a 3100 net decrease in shortterm borrowings during the year which were partially offset by 7996 in longterm debt proceeds 

we like other food manufacturers are from time to time subject to various administrative regulatory and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business we are currently a defendant in a variety of such legal proceedings including certain lawsuits related to the alleged pricefixing of shelf stable tuna products prior to 2011 by a business previously owned by but divested prior to our acquisition of big heart the significant majority of which we settled during 2019 and the remainder of which we anticipate resolving in the near future while we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of these proceedings or potential settlements associated with these matters we have accrued losses for certain contingent liabilities that we have determined are probable and reasonably estimable at april 30 2019 based on the information known to date with the exception of the matter discussed below we do not believe the final outcome of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition to the legal proceedings discussed above we are currently a defendant in cert v brad barry llc et al which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants who manufacture package distribute or sell coffee failed to provide warnings for our coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under proposition 65 as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit we dispute these claims acrylamide is not added to coffee but is inherently present in all coffee in small amounts measured in parts per billion as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process the outcome and the financial impact of the case if any cannot be predicted at this time accordingly no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter as of april 30 2019 as the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable however if we are required to pay significant statutory penalties or to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 our business and financial results could be adversely impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere for additional information see note 15 contingencies 

capital resources 

the following table presents our capital structure 



in april 2018 we entered into a senior unsecured delayeddraw term loan credit agreement “term loan” with a syndicate of banks and an available commitment amount of 15 billion  the full amount of the term loan was drawn on may 14 2018 to partially finance the ainsworth acquisition borrowings under the term loan bear interest on the prevailing us prime rate or london interbank offered rate “libor” based on our election and is payable either on a quarterly basis or at the end of the borrowing term the term loan matures on may 14 2021 and does not require scheduled amortization payments voluntary prepayments are permitted without premium or penalty as of april 30 2019 we have prepaid 7000  on the term loan the interest rate on the term loan at april 30 2019 was 362 percent  

we have available a 18 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of 11 banks that matures in september 2022 additionally we participate in a commercial paper program under which we can issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper not to exceed 18 billion at any time the commercial paper program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces what we can borrow under the revolving credit facility by the amount of commercial paper outstanding commercial paper will be used as a continuing source of shortterm financing for general corporate purposes as of april 30 2019 we had 4260   of shortterm borrowing s outstanding all of which were issued under our commercial paper program at a weightedaverage interest rate of 275  percent 

we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants for additional information on our longterm debt sources of liquidity and debt covenants see note 8 debt and financing arrangements 

during 2019 we did no t repurchase any common shares under a repurchase plan authorized by the board at april 30 2019  approximately 36 million  common shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to the board’s authorizations there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that may be repurchased or when such purchases may occur 

in june 2017 we began construction of a smucker’s uncrustables frozen sandwich manufacturing facility in longmont colorado the new facility will help meet growing demand for smucker’s uncrustables frozen sandwiches and will complement our existing facility in scottsville kentucky the longmont facility will be constructed in two phases the first of which includes an initial investment of up to 2500 to construct and equip the new facility the scope of a phase 2 expansion will depend on product demand production is expected to begin at the new facility during the second half of calendar year 2019 

the following table presents certain cash requirements related to 2020 investing and financing activities based on our current expectations 

absent any material acquisitions or other significant investments we believe that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operations borrowings available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures the payment of quarterly dividends principal and interest payments on debt outstanding and share repurchases 

during 2019 we repatriated 1229 of international cash in conjunction with the restructuring of our international holding and operating entities referenced in “restructuring activities” in this discussion and analysis to simplify and align our foreign structure with the current strategy of the international business the applicable foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes were not significant as of april 30 2019  total cash and cash equivalents of 952 was held by our foreign subsidiaries primarily in canada the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial measures including net sales excluding acquisition divestiture and foreign currency exchange adjusted gross profit adjusted operating income adjusted income adjusted earnings per share earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and impairment charges related to intangible assets “ebitda as adjusted” and free cash flow as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures furthermore these nongaap financial measures are used by management in preparation of the annual budget and for the monthly analyses of our operating results the board of directors also utilizes certain nongaap financial measures as components for measuring performance for incentive compensation purposes 

nongaap measures exclude certain items affecting comparability that can significantly affect the yearoveryear assessment of operating results which include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets integration and restructuring costs “special project costs” and unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives “unallocated derivative gains and losses” the special project costs in the following table relate to specific integration and restructuring projects and the unallocated derivative gains and losses reflect the changes in fair value of our commodity and foreign currency exchange contracts during 2018 we expanded our nongaap measures to also exclude certain onetime discrete tax adjustments these adjustments which were finalized in 2019 include the effect of the onetime items associated with the act comprised of the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities and the recognition of the onetime repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred “transition tax” also included in the onetime discrete tax adjustments are the permanent tax impacts related to the goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2019 and 2018 for further details on these adjustments refer to note 13 income taxes and note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets we believe that excluding these onetime discrete tax adjustments from our nongaap measures provides comparability across the periods presented 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” rather the presentation of these nongaap financial measures supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and liquidity these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments 

the following table reconciles certain nongaap measures to the comparable gaap financial measure see page 20 for a reconciliation of net sales adjusted for certain noncomparable items to the comparable gaap financial measure 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have material offbalance sheet arrangements financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons also known as variable interest entities transactions with related parties are in the ordinary course of business and are not material to our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations by fiscal year at april 30 2019  



 

critical accounting estimates and policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates 

trade marketing and merchandising programs  in order to support our products various promotional activities are conducted through retail trade distributors or directly with consumers including instore display and product placement programs feature price discounts coupons and other similar activities the costs of these programs are classified as a reduction of sales we regularly review and revise when we deem necessary estimates of costs for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by retail trade distributors or consumers these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs differences between estimated expenditures and actual performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period during 2019 2018 and 2017 subsequent period adjustments were less than 2  percent of both consolidated pretax income and cash provided by operating activities these promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of sales represented 36 percent of net sales in 2019  the possibility exists that reported results could be different if factors such as the level and success of the promotional programs or other conditions differ from expectations 

  

income taxes  we account for income taxes using the liability method in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to uncertainties related to tax filing positions and periodically assess the technical merits of these tax positions for all tax years that remain subject to examination based upon the latest information available for material uncertain tax positions we have recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits including any applicable interest and penalty charges 

we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of such assets will not be realized valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws statutory tax rates and projected future taxable income levels changes in estimated realization of deferred tax assets would result in an adjustment to income in the period in which that determination is made unless such changes are determined to be an adjustment to goodwill within the allowable measurement period under the acquisition method of accounting 

the future tax benefit arising from the net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is  1636  and 1291 at april 30 2019 and 2018 respectively in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and results of operations for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance would have been provided 

as of april 30 2019 the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries primarily in canada remain permanently reinvested 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment on february 1 and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2019  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled  130 billion  compared to total assets of  167 billion  and total shareholders’ equity of  80 billion  if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

to test for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a marketbased approach the impairment test incorporates estimates of future cash flows allocations of certain assets liabilities and cash flows among reporting units future growth rates terminal value amounts and the applicable weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows the estimates and projections used in the calculation of fair value are consistent with our current and longrange plans including anticipated changes in market conditions industry trends growth rates and planned capital expenditures changes in forecasted operations and other estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2019  goodwill totaled  63 billion  goodwill is substantially concentrated within the us retail pet foods us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments during 2019  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 979 related to the goodwill of the natural foods reporting unit within the us retail consumer foods segment which was driven by a reduction in our longterm net sales and profitability projections there is no goodwill remaining within the natural foods reporting unit as a result of this charge the estimated fair value of each remaining reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual test date with the exception of the pet foods reporting unit for which its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 1  percent a sensitivity analysis was performed for the pet foods reporting unit assuming a hypothetical 50basispoint decrease in the expected longterm growth rate or a hypothetical 50basispoint increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the pet foods reporting unit below carrying value 

other indefinitelived intangible assets consisting entirely of trademarks are also tested for impairment at least annually and more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable to test these assets for impairment we estimate the fair value of each asset based on a discounted cash flow model using various inputs including projected revenues an assumed royalty rate and a discount rate changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the assessment of impairment in the future 

at april 30 2019  other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled 30 billion trademarks that represent our leading brands comprise more than 90 percent of the total carrying value of other indefinitelived intangible assets as of april 30 2019  the estimated fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for the majority of these leading brand trademarks and in all instances the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by greater than 10 percent with the exception of the indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment during 2019 and 2018 we recognized impairment charges of 1072 and 319 respectively related to certain indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment to the extent that the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value 

the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the us retail pet foods segment remain susceptible to future impairment charges given the narrow differences between fair value and carrying value at 

april 30 2019  in addition any significant adverse changes to the forecasted net sales or profitability as well as any significant adverse changes in strategy could result in future impairment charges which could be material for additional information see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement benefit plans  to determine the ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works various actuarial assumptions must be made in order to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date the most significant being the interest rates used to discount the obligations of the plans the longterm rates of return on the plans’ assets mortality assumptions assumed pay increases and the health care cost trend rates we along with thirdparty actuaries and investment managers review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 

we utilize a spot rate methodology for the estimation of service and interest cost for our plans by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows to provide a better estimate of service and interest costs for 2020 expense recognition we will use weightedaverage discount rates for the us defined benefit pension plans of 399 percent to determine benefit obligation 420 percent to determine service cost and 361 percent to determine interest cost and a rate of compensation increase of 356 percent for the canadian defined benefit pension plans we will use weightedaverage discount rates of 321 percent to determine benefit obligation 329 percent to determine service cost and 286 percent to determine interest cost and a rate of compensation increase of 300 percent in addition we anticipate using an expected rate of return on plan assets of 528 percent and 500 percent for the us and canadian defined benefit pension plans respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

derivative financial instruments and market risk 

the following discussions about our market risk disclosures involve forwardlooking statements actual results could differ from those projected in the forwardlooking statements we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

interest rate risk  the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at april 30 2019  approximates carrying value we are exposed to interest rate risk with regard to existing debt consisting of fixed and variablerate maturities our interest rate exposure primarily includes us treasury rates libor and commercial paper rates in the us 

we utilize derivative instruments to manage interest risk associated with anticipated debt transactions as well as to manage changes in the fair value of our longterm debt at the inception of an interest rate contract the instrument is evaluated and documented for qualifying hedge accounting treatment if the contract is designated as a cash flow hedge the marktomarket gains or losses on the contract are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to interest expense in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings if the contract is designated as a fair value hedge the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest expense generally changes in the fair value of the contract are equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have no net impact on earnings 

we entered into interest rate contracts in november 2018 and june 2018 with notional values of 3000 and 5000 respectively to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility associated with anticipated debt financing in 2020 these interest rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and as a result unrealized losses of 491 were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at april 30 2019 a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in treasury rates at april 30 2019 would result in a loss of 284 on the fair value of these interest rate contracts 

in 2018 we terminated a treasury lock concurrent with the pricing of the senior notes due december 15 2027 which was designated as a cash flow hedge and used to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility the termination resulted in a gain of 27 which was deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the debt 

in 2015 we terminated the interest rate swap on the senior notes due october 15 2021 which was designated as a fair value hedge and used to hedge against the changes in the fair value of the debt as a result of the early termination we received 581 in cash which included 46 of accrued and prepaid interest and a 535 benefit that is deferred as a component of the carrying value of the longterm debt and is being recognized ratably as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt at april 30 2019 the remaining benefit of 205 was recorded as an increase in the longterm debt balance 

in measuring interest rate risk by the amount of net change in the fair value of our financial liabilities a hypothetical 

100basispoint decrease in interest rates at april 30 2019  would increase the fair value of our longterm debt by 2839  

foreign currency exchange risk  we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily denominated in canadian currency because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities financial exposure may result primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of april 30 2019  are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or 

cash flows 

we utilize foreign currency derivatives to manage the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on future cash payments in canada primarily related to purchases of certain raw materials and finished goods the contracts generally have maturities of less than one year we do not qualify instruments used to manage foreign currency exchange exposures for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in cost of products sold based on our hedged foreign currency positions as of april 30 2019  a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates would not materially impact the fair value 

revenues from customers outside the us subject to foreign currency exchange represented 5 percent of net sales during 2019  thus certain revenues and expenses have been and are expected to be subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results 

commodity price risk  we use certain raw materials and other commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by supply and demand conditions political and economic variables weather investor speculation and other unpredictable factors to manage the volatility related to anticipated commodity purchases we use derivatives with maturities of generally less than one year we do not qualify commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment as a result the gains and losses on all commodity derivatives are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 

the following sensitivity analysis presents our potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent change in market prices related to commodities 



the estimated fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity for the previous four quarters the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur in practice as markets move we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate the commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative instrument thus we would expect that any gain or loss in the estimated fair value of these derivatives would generally be offset by an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the underlying exposures

we have four reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods us retail pet foods and international and away from home the us retail market segments in total comprised approximately 85 percent of 2018  consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america the international and away from home segment represents sales outside of the us retail market segments 

principal products  our principal products as of april 30 2018  are coffee pet food and pet snacks peanut butter fruit spreads shortening and oils baking mixes and readytospread frostings frozen sandwiches flour and baking ingredients juices and beverages and portion control products 

product sales information for the years 2018  2017  and 2016  is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2018  annual report to shareholders under “note 5 reportable segments” 

in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers food wholesalers club stores pet specialty stores discount and dollar stores drug stores military commissaries mass merchandisers natural foods stores and distributors and online retailers in the international and away from home segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee peanuts oils and fats protein meals sweeteners grains fruit and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures options and fixed price contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source peanuts oils and fats and protein meals mainly from north america the principal packaging materials we use are plastic glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate   for additional information on the commodities we purchase see “commodities overview” in our 2018  annual report to shareholders 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing 

trademarks and patents  our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries our major trademarks as of april 30 2018  are listed below

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments are particularly seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the fall bake and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the back to school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods although their impact is not as significant as the fall bake and holiday period 

working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil and baking inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season however the impact of seasonality on our overall working capital requirements is partially reduced by the us retail pet foods segment which does not experience significant seasonality 

customers  sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 31  percent of net sales in 2018  and 30  percent of net sales in both 2017  and 2016  these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2018  2017  or 2016  

during 2018  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business  no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  we are the branded market leader in the coffee peanut butter dog snacks fruit spreads natural shelf stable juices shortening and ice cream toppings categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles fruit spreads canned milk shortening and ice cream toppings categories   our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the continued growth of alternative store formats including warehouse clubs dollar stores convenience stores and ecommerce the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged recently by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty in our total us retail categories during the 52 weeks ended april 22 2018 private label held a 161 dollar average market share as compared to a 154 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year the majority of the increase was within the coffee category we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

  

our primary brands and major competitors as of april 30 2018  are listed below 

a identifies the current market leader within the product category in certain categories the market leader is not identified as two or more brands compete 

        for the largest share 

b crisco is the market leader within the shortening category in the oils category private label brands collectively maintain the largest share 

c we acquired ainsworth on may 14 2018 

research and development  we predominantly utilize inhouse resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of our business areas amounts expensed for research and development were 560  million 581 million and 588 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

environmental matters  we consider compliance with environmental regulations and environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area we have public goals related to waste diversion water usage intensity reduction and greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction we have implemented and manage a variety of programs across our footprint including energy optimization the utilization of renewable energy water conservation the reuse of resources and the support of farmers who implement sustainable practices in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2019 

employees  at april 30 2018  we had approximately 7000 fulltime employees worldwide of which 28  percent located at 10  manufacturing locations are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on location with one  contract expiring in 2019 representing less than 1  percent of our total employees we believe our relations with our employees are good on may 14 2018 we added approximately 700 additional employees with the completion of the ainsworth acquisition none of which are covered by union contracts 

financial information about industry segments and geographical areas  the financial information required to be included in this item concerning reportable industry segments and international operations for the years 2018  2017  and 2016  is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2018  annual report to shareholders under “note 5 reportable segments” our international operations are primarily in canada with risks similar to those associated with the us retail markets approximately 45 percent of our 2018  canada sales represented the sale of canadian produced products to canadian customers the majority of the remaining canada sales represented the sale of products produced in the us to canadian customers primarily folgers  coffee bick’s ®  pickles and smucker’s  fruit spreads 

forwardlooking statements  this report includes forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results the descriptions of risks and uncertainties relating to forwardlooking statements are incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2018  annual report to shareholders under the caption “forwardlooking statements” 

available information  access to all of our securities and exchange commission “sec” filings including our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is provided free of charge on our website jmsmuckercominvestorrelationssmuckerssecfilings as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   

• we may be unable to grow market share of our products 

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

 the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as our aromaseal ™  canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

 we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

 we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers  coffee products as well as our jif  peanut butter and crisco  oil products and finished goods such as kcup ®  pods and our pupperoni  dog snacks from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ®  pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup ®  brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ®  pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts oils and fats protein meals sweeteners grains and fruit in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in addition we compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural 

products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher cost for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures and options contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability as compared to that of our competitors in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

 we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

 we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products including substantially all of our coffee milkbone  dog snacks fruit spreads toppings syrups and uncrustables frozen sandwiches into single manufacturing sites we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events additionally some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes can frequently occur such as alabama and kansas failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 as of april 30 2018  28  percent of our fulltime employees located at 10  manufacturing locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with one  contract expiring in 2019 representing less than 1  percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

 sales to walmart inc and subsidiaries amounted to 31  percent of net sales in 2018  these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2018  included amounts due from walmart inc and subsidiaries of 1231  million or 32 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2018  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of 

customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels such as ecommerce and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through investment in innovation will be less successful in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability 

 we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the dunkin’ donuts  rachael ray  pillsbury  carnation  sweet‘n low  or sugar in the raw  brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 certain of our products contain ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the 

health effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in particular our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the ainsworth acquisition will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the ainsworth business into smucker the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating ainsworth’s business practices and operations with our business practices and operations the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects of the acquisition our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses including a potential divestiture of our us baking business and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses our business and financial results could be negatively impacted 

 as part of our organization optimization and cost management programs we are pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale any failure to implement our cost reduction initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital 

markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 as of april 30 2018  we had approximately 48 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt subsequently on may 14 2018 we borrowed 19 billion  to finance the ainsworth acquisition we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences including 

 our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate future cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the payment of all of our debt 



a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2018  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 119 billion compared to total assets of 153 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 79 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings which could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

as a result of the big heart acquisition in 2015 we recognized 30 billion of goodwill and 15 billion of other indefinitelived intangible assets based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date during 2017 we recognized total impairment charges of 1285 related to certain indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment during the third quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment analysis on the goodwill of the pet foods reporting unit and the indefinitelived trademarks included within the us retail pet foods segment due to a decline in forecasted net sales for the us retail pet foods segment as well as the narrow differences between estimated fair value and carrying value as a result we recognized total impairment charges of 1769 of which 1450 and 319 related to the goodwill of the pet foods reporting unit and certain indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment respectively to the extent the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values the goodwill and indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment remain susceptible to future impairment charges as the carrying values approximate estimated fair values at april 30 2018  in addition any meaningful adverse change to our near or longterm projections or macroeconomic conditions could result in future impair ment charges further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the us retail pet foods segment or its brands or a change to other assumptions could result in additional impairment losses in the future which could be more significant 

in addition as a result of the ainsworth acquisition in may 2018 we will recognize additional goodwill and other intangible assets which will be included within the us retail pet foods reportable segment based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date since carrying value will represent estimated fair value these assets could be more susceptible to future impairment a change to the assumptions regarding future performance of the business or a portion of it or a change to other assumptions could result in significant impairment losses in the future 

 our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 better known as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products as well as civil penalties the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt 

from the warning requirement in particular we are currently a defendant in council for education and research on toxics v brad barry llc et al  which alleges that we in addition to nearly eighty other defendants who manufacture package distribute or sell coffee failed to warn persons in california that our coffee products expose persons to the chemical acrylamide which is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts measured in parts per billion as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process in violation of proposition 65 if we are required to pay significant statutory penalties or to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 our business and financial results could be adversely impacted and sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures and potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts oils and fats protein meals sweeteners grains and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

 we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our 

business or financial results could be negatively impacted security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

in addition we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in addition certain of our processes rely on thirdparty cloud computing services if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

 item 2 properties   

          the table below lists all of our manufacturing and processing facilities at april 30 2018  a all of our properties are maintained and updated on a regular basis and we continue to make investments for expansion and safety and technological improvements for instance in addition to the facilities listed below we purchased land in longmont colorado and are constructing a second smuckers uncrustables  frozen sandwich facility there we believe that the capacity at our existing facilities combined with the additional capacity at the longmont facility will be sufficient to sustain current operations and the anticipated nearterm growth of our businesses production is expected to begin at the longmont facility during 2020 

          we own all of the properties listed below except as noted   additionally our principal distribution centers in the us include three that we own and six that we lease we also lease our principal distribution center in canada our distribution facilities are in good condition and we believe that they have sufficient capacity to meet our distribution needs in the near future we lease eight sales and administrative offices in the us and one each in china canada and mexico b our corporate headquarters is located in orrville ohio and our canadian headquarters is located in markham ontario we lease the principal headquarters of our pet food business located in san francisco california as well as additional administrative facilities dedicated to that business in burbank california b   



 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

         we are a defendant in a variety of legal proceedings while we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate results of these proceedings we do not believe that the final outcome of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows with the exception of the matter discussed below 

on may 9 2011 an organization named council for education and research on toxics “plaintiff” filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of california county of los angeles against us and additional defendants who manufacture package distribute or sell packaged coffee the lawsuit is council for education and research on toxics v brad barry llc et al  and was a tag along to a 2010 lawsuit against companies selling “readytodrink” coffee based on the same claims both cases have since been consolidated and now include nearly eighty defendants which constitute the great majority of the coffee industry in california the plaintiff alleges that we and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for our coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under california health and safety code section 252495 the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 better known as proposition 65 the plaintiff seeks equitable relief including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per day per violation of proposition 65 the plaintiff asserts that every consumed cup of coffee absent a compliant warning is equivalent to a violation under proposition 65 

as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit we dispute the claims of the plaintiff acrylamide is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts measured in parts per billion as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process we have asserted multiple affirmative defenses trial of the first phase of the case commenced on september 8 2014 and was limited to three affirmative defenses shared by all defendants on september 1 2015 the trial court issued a final ruling adverse to the defendants on all phase 1 defenses trial of the second phase of the case commenced in the fall of calendar year 2017 on march 28 2018 the trial court issued a proposed ruling adverse to the defendants on the phase 2 defense our last remaining defense to liability the trial court finalized and affirmed its phase 2 ruling on may 7 2018 and therefore the trial will proceed to the third phase regarding remedies issues 

at this stage of the proceedings prior to a trial on remedies issues we are unable to predict or reasonably estimate the potential loss or effect on our operations accordingly no loss contingency has been recorded for this matter as of april 30 2018 as the likelihood of loss is not considered probable or estimable the trial court has discretion to impose zero penalties against us or to impose significant statutory penalties significant labeling or warning requirements that could potentially be imposed by the trial court may increase our costs and adversely affect sales of our coffee products as well as involve substantial expense and operational disruption which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows furthermore a future appellate court decision could reverse the trial court rulings the outcome and the financial impact of settlement or the trial or appellate court rulings of the case if any cannot be predicted at this time for additional information see “note 15 contingencies” in our 2018 annual report to shareholders

 item 1 business 

the company  the j m smucker company “company” “registrant” “we” “us” or “our” often referred to as smucker’s a registered trademark was established in 1897 and incorporated in ohio in 1921 we operate principally in one industry the manufacturing and marketing of branded food and beverage products on a worldwide basis although the majority of our sales are in the us our operations outside the us are principally in canada although products are exported to other countries as well net sales outside the us subject to foreign currency translation represented 6 percent of consolidated net sales for 2017  our branded food and beverage products include a strong portfolio of trusted iconic marketleading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in north america 

on march 23 2015 we completed the acquisition of big heart pet brands “big heart” a leading producer distributor and marketer of premiumquality branded pet food and pet snacks in the us the cash and stock transaction was valued at 59 billion which included the issuance of 179 million shares of our common stock to the shareholders of blue acquisition group inc big heart’s parent company we assumed 26 billion in debt that we repaid at closing and paid an additional 12 billion in cash net of a working capital adjustment as part of the transaction new debt of 55 billion was borrowed for additional information on the big heart acquisition see “note 2 acquisition” in our 2017  annual report to shareholders 

we have three reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods and us retail pet foods the us retail market segments in total comprised over 85 percent of 2017  consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america within our segment results international and foodservice represents a combination of the strategic business areas not included in the us retail market segments 

principal products  our principal products are coffee pet food pet snacks peanut butter fruit spreads shortening and oils baking mixes and readytospread frostings frozen sandwiches flour and baking ingredients juices and beverages and portion control products 

product sales information for the years 2017  2016  and 2015  is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2017  annual report to shareholders under “note 5 reportable segments” 

in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers food wholesalers drug stores club stores mass merchandisers discount and dollar stores military commissaries natural foods stores and distributors pet specialty stores and online retailers in international and foodservice our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee grains peanuts edible oils protein meals sweeteners fruit and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures options and fixed price contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand plant disease investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source grains peanuts and edible oils mainly from north america the principal packaging materials we use are plastic glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate   for additional information on the commodities we purchase see “commodities overview” in our 2017  annual report to shareholders 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing 

trademarks and patents  our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries our major trademarks are listed below 



dunkin’ donuts  is a registered trademark of dd ip holder llc used under two licenses the “dunkin’ licenses” for packaged coffee products including kcup ®  pods sold in retail channels such as grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores and drug stores the dunkin’ licenses do not pertain to dunkin’ donuts  coffee or other products for sale in dunkin’ donuts  restaurants the terms of the dunkin’ licenses include the payment of royalties to an affiliate of dd ip holder llc and other financial commitments by the company the dunkin’ licenses are in effect until january 1 2039

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments are particularly seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the fall bake and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the back to school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods although their impact is not as significant as the fall bake and holiday period 

working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil and baking inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season although we still expect an inventory buildup during the first half of the fiscal year within the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments our working capital requirements became less seasonal overall subsequent to the big heart acquisition since the us retail pet foods segment does not experience significant seasonality 

customers  sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 30 percent of net sales in both 2017  and 2016  and 28 percent of net sales in 2015  these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2017  2016  or 2015  

during 2017  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business  no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  we are the branded market leader in the coffee dog snacks peanut butter fruit spreads shortening natural beverage and ice cream toppings categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles canned milk fruit spreads shortening and ice cream toppings categories   our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the continued growth of alternative store formats including warehouse clubs convenience stores and ecommerce the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged recently by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

  

our primary brands and major competitors as of april 30 2017  are listed below 

a identifies the current market leader within the product category in certain categories the market leader is not identified as two or more brands compete 

        for the largest share 

b crisco is the market leader within the shortening category in the oils category private label brands collectively maintain the largest share 

research and development  we predominantly utilize inhouse resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of our business areas amounts expensed for research and development were 581  million 588 million and 325 million in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

environmental matters  we consider compliance with environmental regulations and environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area we have implemented and manage a variety of programs including the utilization of renewable energy technology water conservation the sourcing and usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee and the reuse of resources in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   

• we may be unable to grow market share of our products 

we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is positively correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

 the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as our aromaseal ™  canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

 we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

 we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers  coffee products as well as our jif  peanut butter and crisco  oil products and finished goods such as kcup ®  pods and our pupperoni  dog snacks from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ®  pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup ®  brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ®  pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee grains peanuts edible oils protein meals sweeteners and fruit in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in addition we compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural 

products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher cost for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures and options contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability as compared to that of our competitors in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

 we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

 we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products including substantially all of our coffee milkbone  dog snacks fruit spreads toppings syrups and uncrustables frozen sandwiches into single manufacturing sites we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events additionally some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes can frequently occur such as alabama and kansas failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 as of april 30 2017  27 percent of our employees located at 11 manufacturing facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with five contracts expiring in 2018 representing 8 percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

 sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 30 percent of net sales in 2017  these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2017  included amounts due from walmart stores inc and subsidiaries of 1382 million or 32 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2017  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a 

limited number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels such as ecommerce and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability 

 we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the pillsbury  dunkin’ donuts  carnation  sweet‘n low  or sugar in the raw  brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 certain of our products contain ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the health effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are 

ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 our stated strategic vision is to own and market a portfolio of food and beverage brands that combines number one and leading brands with emerging ontrend brands to drive balanced longterm growth primarily in north america we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses our business and financial results could be negatively impacted 

 as part of our organization optimization and cost management programs we are pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from such initiatives other events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays or unexpected costs may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits or cause us not to realize such cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected finally the complexity of the implementation will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from other business issues have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and impact employee morale any failure to implement our cost reduction initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business and financial results 

 we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 as of april 30 2017  we had approximately 54 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness rather than for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth our substantial indebtedness could have other adverse consequences including 

 our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our ability to generate future cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when scheduled payments are due or to fund other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we may have to seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

 a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more often if indicators of impairment exist at april 30 2017  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 122 billion compared to total assets of 156 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 69 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this would result in a noncash charge to earnings which could be material any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results 

as a result of the big heart acquisition in 2015 we recognized 30 billion of goodwill and15 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date being recently acquired these assets have been more susceptible to impairment during 2017 we performed several impairment analyses on the goodwill of the pet foods reporting unit and the indefinitelived trademarks included within the us retail pet foods segment due to reduced financial projections for the 

business and changes to other assumptions most notably an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount estimates of future cash flows as a result impairment charges of 1285 were recognized in 2017 related to certain indefinitelived trademarks within the us retail pet foods segment no impairment charges were recognized on the goodwill of the pet foods reporting unit as a result of the analyses further changes to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the us retail pet foods segment or its brands a change to other assumptions or the failure of any of our reporting units to achieve its anticipated synergies related to the big heart acquisition could result in additional impairment losses in the future which could be more significant 

 our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures and potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on 

global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee grains peanuts edible oils protein meals sweeteners and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

 we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

in addition we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

we have three reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods and us retail pet foods the us retail market segments in total comprised over 85 percent of 2016  consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america within our segment results international and foodservice represents a combination of the strategic business areas not included in the us retail market segments 

principal products  our principal products are coffee pet food pet snacks peanut butter fruit spreads shortening and oils baking mixes and readytospread frostings frozen sandwiches flour and baking ingredients juices and beverages and portion control products 

product sales information for the years 2016  2015  and 2014  is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2016  annual report to shareholders under “note 5 reportable segments” 

in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers food wholesalers drug stores club stores mass merchandisers discount and dollar stores military commissaries natural foods stores and distributors and pet specialty stores in international and foodservice our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee grains peanuts edible oils sweeteners fruit and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures and options contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand pest damage investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source grains peanuts and edible oils mainly from north america the principal packaging materials we use are plastic glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate for additional information on the commodities we purchase see “commodities overview” in our 2016  annual report to shareholders 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are 

available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments are particularly seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the fall bake and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the back to school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods although their impact is not as significant as the fall bake and holiday period 

working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil and baking inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season although we still expect an inventory buildup during the first half of the fiscal year within the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods businesses our working capital requirements have become less seasonal overall with the addition of the pet food business 

customers  sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 30 percent 28 percent and 27 percent of net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments the increase in 2016 was driven by a full year of sales from the pet food business in which sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries represent a larger portion of net sales as compared to our business prior to the big heart acquisition no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2016  2015  or 2014  

during 2016  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business  no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  we are the branded market leader in the coffee peanut butter dog snacks fruit spreads shortening natural beverage and ice cream toppings categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles canned milk fruit spreads shortening and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the continued growth of alternative store formats including warehouse clubs convenience stores and ecommerce the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged recently by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label has grown in recent years due to general economic uncertainty improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the food categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

  

our primary brands the brands with which they compete and our major competitors are listed below 



a identifies the current market leader within the product category in certain categories the market leader is not identified as two or more brands compete 

        for the largest share 

b crisco is the market leader within the shortening category in the oils category private label brands collectively maintain the largest share 

research and development  we predominantly utilize inhouse resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of our business areas amounts expensed for research and development were 588  million 325 million and 243 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

environmental matters  we consider environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area we have implemented and manage a variety of programs including the utilization of renewable energy technology wastewater management the usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee and the reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2017 

employees  at april 30 2016  we had 6910 fulltime employees worldwide of which 30 percent located at 11 manufacturing facilities are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on the location with one contract expiring in 2017 representing 8 percent of our total employees we believe our relations with our employees are good 

financial information about industry segments and geographical areas  the financial information required to be included in this item concerning reportable industry segments and international operations for the years 2016  2015  and 2014  is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2016  annual report to shareholders under “note 5 reportable segments” our international operations are primarily in canada with risks similar to those associated with the us retail markets approximately 40 percent of our 2016 canada sales represented the sale of canadian produced products to canadian customers the majority of the remaining canada sales represented the sale of products produced in the us to canadian customers primarily folgers  coffee bick’s ®  pickles smucker’s  fruit spreads and crisco  shortening and oils 

forwardlooking statements  this report includes forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results the descriptions of risks and uncertainties relating to forwardlooking statements are incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2016  annual report to shareholders under the caption “forwardlooking statements” 

available information  access to all of our securities and exchange commission “sec” filings including our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is provided free of charge on our website jmsmuckercominvestorrelations as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations   

 we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is generally correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations   

 the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brand if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as brick packaging technology and our aromaseal ™  canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

 we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

 we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers  coffee products as well as our jif  peanut butter and crisco  oil products and finished goods such as kcup ®  pods and our pupperoni  dog snacks from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ®  pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup ®  brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ®  pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee grains peanuts edible oils sweeteners and fruit in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters foreign currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in addition we compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices 

for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher cost for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures and options contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

we currently do not qualify any of our commodity or foreign currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting we instead marktomarket our derivatives through the statement of consolidated income which results in changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives being immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in potential volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but are excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this accounting treatment aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results it may result in volatility in our consolidated earnings 

 we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

 we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products including substantially all of our coffee milkbone  dog snacks and fruit spreads syrups and toppings production into single manufacturing sites we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events additionally some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes can frequently occur such as alabama and kansas failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 as of april 30 2016  30 percent of our employees located at 11 manufacturing facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with one contract expiring in 2017 representing 8 percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

 sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 30 percent of net sales in 2016  these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2016  included amounts due from walmart stores inc and subsidiaries of 1181 million or 26 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2016  our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a 

limited number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and to compete in new and growing channels such as ecommerce and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets channels and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability 

 we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the pillsbury  dunkin’ donuts  carnation  douwe egberts  sweet‘n low  or sugar in the raw  brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 certain of our products contain ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the health effects of ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations 

could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 our stated longterm strategy is to own and market leading north american food brands sold in the center of the store while maintaining a global perspective we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including the effective management of integration and related restructuring costs we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition we have made strategic divestitures of brands and businesses and we may do so in the future if we are unable to complete divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses our business or financial results could be negatively impacted 

 we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or the failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 as of april 30 2016  we had approximately 54 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 



 our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

 our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we could be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances in addition we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations 

 a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment at april 30 2016  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 126 billion compared to total assets of 160 billion and total shareholders’ equity of 70 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this could result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life as a result of the big heart acquisition in 2015 we recognized 30 billion of goodwill we also recorded 15 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date since these assets were recently acquired they could be more susceptible to future impairment a change to the assumptions regarding the future performance of the pet food business or a portion of it a change to other assumptions or the failure of any of our reporting units to achieve its anticipated synergies related to the big heart acquisition could result in significant impairment losses in the future 

 our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging advertising relations with 

distributors and retailers health safety and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act the tariff act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee grains peanuts edible oils sweeteners and fruit we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

 we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

in addition we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

 item 1 business tableend the company  the j m smucker company “company” “registrant” “we” “us” or “our” was established in 1897 was incorporated in ohio in 1921 and is often referred to as smucker’s a registered trademark we operate principally in one industry the manufacturing and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis although the majority of our sales are in the us our operations outside the us are principally in canada although products are exported to other countries as well net sales outside the us subject to foreign currency exchange represented 8 percent of consolidated net sales for 2015 our branded food products include a strong portfolio of trusted iconic marketleading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in north america 

on march 23 2015 we completed the acquisition of big heart pet brands “big heart” a leading producer distributor and marketer of premiumquality branded pet food and pet snacks in the us the cash and stock transaction was valued at 59 billion which included the assumption of 26 billion in debt that we refinanced at closing we issued 179 million shares of our common stock to the shareholders of blue acquisition group inc big heart’s parent company and paid 12 billion in cash subject to a working capital adjustment after the closing of the transaction on march 23 2015 we had approximately 1200 million common shares outstanding we funded the nonequity portion of the acquisition through the combination of a 18 billion bank term loan and 37 billion in longterm notes 

we have four reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods us retail pet foods and international foodservice and natural foods the us retail market segments in total comprised over 75 percent of 2015 consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america the international foodservice and natural foods segment represents sales outside of the us retail market segments 

principal products  our principal consumer food and beverage products are coffee peanut butter fruit spreads shortening and oils baking mixes and readytospread frostings canned milk flour and baking ingredients juices and beverages frozen sandwiches toppings syrups pickles condiments grain products and nut mix products our pet products consist of dry and wet dog food dry and wet cat food dog snacks and cat snacks 

product sales information for the years 2015 2014 and 2013 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2015 annual report to shareholders on page 60 under “note 3 reportable segments” 

in the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers food wholesalers drug stores club stores mass merchandisers discount and dollar stores military commissaries and pet specialty stores in the international foodservice and natural foods segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators and natural foods stores and distributors 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee peanuts edible oils wheat sweeteners corn milk fruit vegetables cocoa poultry meal soybean meal meat meat byproducts and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures and options contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand pest damage investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source peanuts edible oils and wheat mainly from north america the principal packaging materials we use are plastic 

 

glass metal cans caps carton board and corrugate for additional information on the commodities we purchase see “commodities overview” on pages 31 and 32 in our 2015 annual report to shareholders 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be good 

trademarks and patents  our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries our major trademarks are listed below 

 

 dunkin’ donuts is a registered trademark of dd ip holder llc used under license the “dunkin’ license” for packaged coffee products including kcup ® pods sold in retail channels such as grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores and drug stores the dunkin’ license does not pertain to dunkin’ donuts coffee or other products for sale in dunkin’ donuts restaurants the terms of the dunkin’ license include the payment of royalties to an affiliate of dd ip holder llc and other financial commitments by the company the dunkin’ license is in effect until january 1 2039

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments are particularly seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the fall bake and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the back to school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods although their impact is not as significant as the fall bake and holiday period 

working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil baking and milk inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season 

customers  sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 28 percent 27 percent and 26 percent of net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2015 2014 or 2013 within the big heart business sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries represent a larger portion of net sales as compared to our business prior to the acquisition as a result beginning in 2016 we anticipate that sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries will represent a larger portion of net sales than in 2015 due to a full year of big heart sales 

during 2015 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business  no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  within consumer foods and beverages we are the branded market leader in the coffee peanut butter fruit spreads shortening sweetened condensed milk ice cream toppings and natural beverage categories in the us within pet food and pet snacks we are the branded market leader in the dog snacks category in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles canned milk fruit spreads shortening and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

in order to remain competitive companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences technological advances product and packaging innovations and the continued growth of alternative store formats including warehouse clubs convenience stores and ecommerce the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising promotion and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands highquality products consumer trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

the packaged foods industry has been challenged recently by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline such as a 

 

heightened focus on health and wellness an increased desire for fresh foods and the growing impact of social media and ecommerce on consumer behavior to address these dynamics we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends 

in addition private label has grown in recent years due to general economic uncertainty improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty in the pet food and pet snacks categories private label penetration has declined below levels seen in consumer food and beverage categories we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the food categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that 1 brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets

in the international foodservice and natural foods segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries and compete with various brands within retail foodservice and natural foods markets in our foodservice hot beverage business folgers and douwe egberts compete in the liquid and roast and ground coffee categories in the liquid category nescafe is a key competitor along with a variety of branded and private label competitors in the roast and ground category private label has a significant presence and several national and regional brands are also competitors in our foodservice portion control business smucker’s competes in the fruit spreads category with heinz and many private label brands in canada robin hood ® and five roses ® are the market leaders in the flour category competing primarily with private label brands in the canadian retail coffee market folgers competes with the market leader maxwell house  as well as several other branded competitors and some private label brands in our natural foods business r w knudsen family ® is the branded market leader in the natural shelf stable juice category competing primarily with lakewood and many private label brands santa cruz organic ® competes in several natural food and beverage categories with national and regional brands as well as private label within the grains products category truroots ® is a leading organic quinoa brand competing primarily with ancient harvest  we also compete in the 75 countries to which we export our products the majority of our export sales are to the latin america markets

environmental matters  we consider environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area we have implemented and manage a variety of programs including the utilization of renewable energy technology improved wastewater management increased usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee and reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce our impact on the environment and reduce waste 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2016 

employees  at april 30 2015 we had 7370 fulltime employees worldwide of which 28 percent located at 10 manufacturing facilities are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on the location with three contracts expiring in 2016 representing 11 percent of our total employees we believe our relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is generally correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

 the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brand if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as brick packaging technology and our aromaseal tm canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our 

 

competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

 

 we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

 

 we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and crisco oil products and finished goods such as kcup ® pods and our pupperoni dog snack products from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ® pods which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ® pods to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

 we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts edible oils wheat sweeteners corn milk fruit vegetables cocoa poultry meal soybean meal meat and meat byproducts in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in addition we compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher cost for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures and options contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

we expect the green coffee commodity markets to continue to be challenging due to significant ongoing price volatility for example during the first half of the 2014 calendar year drought conditions and coffee tree leaf rust fungus affected production in key coffeeproducing regions such as brazil and central america due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing 

 

practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

beginning in 2015 we elected to marktomarket all of our commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives through the statement of consolidated income prior to 2015 marktomarket gains and losses on derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges were initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of this change in accounting treatment changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives are immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in increased volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses are reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this change more accurately aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results we may experience more volatility in our consolidated earnings as a result of this change in accounting treatment 

 

 we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

 we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products including substantially all of our coffee milkbone dog snacks and fruit spreads syrups and toppings production into single manufacturing sites similarly most of our peanut butter is being produced at our facility in lexington kentucky although the conversion of our facility in memphis tennessee into an additional peanut butter plant was completed in march 2015 we could experience a production 

 

disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

 our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events additionally some of our production facilities are located in places where tornadoes can frequently occur such as alabama and kansas failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 as of april 30 2015 28 percent of our employees located at 10 manufacturing facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with three contracts expiring in 2016 representing 11 percent of our total employees we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

 logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks intermodals and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of 

 

product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

 

 sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 28 percent of net sales in 2015 these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2015 included amounts due from walmart stores inc and subsidiaries of 1226 million or 29 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2015 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales within the big heart business sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries represent a larger portion of net sales as compared to our business prior to the acquisition as a result beginning in 2016 we anticipate that sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries will represent a larger portion of net sales than in 2015 due to a full year of big heart sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and effective and sufficient trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience flavor variety an emphasis on protein and snacking and the desire for transparent product labeling and simple and natural ingredients 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability 

 

 we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us or our brands or products on social or digital media could damage our brands and reputation if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the pillsbury  dunkin’ donuts  carnation  borden  douwe egberts  or cumberland brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 

 certain of our products contain caffeine and other ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 our stated longterm strategy is to own and market leading north american food brands sold in the center of the store while maintaining a global perspective we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in particular our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of big heart will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate the big heart business into smucker the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating big heart’s business practices and operations with our business practices and operations the integration process may disrupt the businesses and if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause 

 

an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations 

specifically the difficulties of combining the operations of big heart with our business include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness which would be dependent upon our financial performance any downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm rating would likely impact the amount of commercial paper we could issue and increase our commercial paper borrowing costs the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 

 as of april 30 2015 we had approximately 62 billion of shortterm borrowings and longterm debt we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures which could impede our growth if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our longterm business prospects our failure to comply with the terms of any existing or future indebtedness could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

 

 our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require makewhole payments and compliance with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing would depend on among other things our financial condition at the time restriction in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the condition of the financial markets and the industry in which we operate as a result we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we could be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances in addition we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations 

 

 a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment at april 30 2015 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 130 billion compared to total assets of approximately 169 billion and total shareholders’ equity of approximately 71 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this could result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life as a result of the big heart acquisition this year we recognized 29 billion of goodwill as of april 30 2015 based on a preliminary valuation we also recorded 15 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date since these assets were recently acquired and carrying value currently represents estimated fair value they could be more susceptible to future impairment a change to the assumptions regarding future performance of the pet food business or a portion of it or a change to other assumptions could result in significant impairment losses in the future 

 

 our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the food safety modernization act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 

 in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

 there is significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green 

 

coffee peanuts edible oils wheat sweeteners corn milk fruit vegetables cocoa poultry meal soybean meal meat and meat byproducts we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

 

 we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

in addition we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including accounts payable processing benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

 item 1 business tableend the company  the j m smucker company “company” “registrant” “we” “us” or “our” was established in 1897 was incorporated in ohio in 1921 and is often referred to as smucker’s a registered trademark we operate principally in one industry the manufacturing and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis although the majority of our sales are in the us our operations outside the us are principally in canada although products are exported to other countries as well net sales outside the us represented 8 percent of consolidated net sales for 2014 our branded food products include a strong portfolio of trusted iconic marketleading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in north america 

on november 6 2008 we completed a merger transaction with the folgers coffee company “folgers” a subsidiary of the procter  gamble company “pg” the value of the transaction was approximately 37 billion including the issuance of our common shares in connection with the merger and 350 million of folgers debt under the terms of the transaction agreements pg distributed common shares of folgers to participating pg shareholders which were then automatically converted into the right to receive common shares of the company in the merger immediately following the merger pg shareholders and premerger company shareholders owned approximately 535 percent and 465 percent respectively of the company’s approximately 118 million common shares outstanding the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination and we were treated as the acquiring entity 

we have three reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods and international foodservice and natural foods the two us retail market segments in total comprised over 75 percent of 2014 consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america the international foodservice and natural foods segment represents sales outside of the us retail market segments 

principal products  our principal products are coffee peanut butter fruit spreads shortening and oils baking mixes and readytospread frostings canned milk flour and baking ingredients juices and beverages frozen sandwiches toppings syrups pickles condiments and grain products 

product sales information for the years 2014 2013 and 2012 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2014 annual report to shareholders on page 52 under “note 4 reportable segments” 

in both of the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers food wholesalers drug stores club stores mass merchandisers discount and dollar stores and military commissaries in the international foodservice and natural foods segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators and natural foods stores and distributors 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee peanuts edible oils sweeteners milk flour corn and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures and options contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee along with certain other raw materials is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand pest damage investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries we source peanuts edible oils and wheat mainly from north america fruit and vegetable raw materials used in the production of our food products are purchased from independent growers and suppliers the principal packaging materials we use are plastic glass steel cans caps carton board and corrugate 

 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be good

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments are particularly seasonal around the fall bake and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our baking and coffee brands during the fall bake and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the backtoschool period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods although their impact is not as significant as the fall bake and holiday period 

working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil and baking inventories necessary to support the fall bake and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season 

customers  sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 27 percent of net sales in 2014 and 26 percent of net sales in 2013 and 2012 these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2014 2013 or 2012 

during 2014 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for 62 percent of consolidated net sales supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business  no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  we are the branded market leader in the coffee peanut butter fruit spreads shortening sweetened condensed milk ice cream toppings and natural beverages categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles canned milk fruit spreads shortening and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

the continued growth of alternative store formats product and packaging innovations technological advances and new industry techniques need to be considered by companies in the food industry in order to remain competitive the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising and promotion positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands superior product quality and trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

accelerated private label growth is typically seen during periods of general economic disruption most recently during the period following the economic recession of the late 2000’s it was estimated that private label grew more than during past periods partly due to the run up in commodity costs increased emphasis of store brands by retailers and improvements in private label quality we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that 1 brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

 

in the us retail coffee segment the folgers brand competes in the highly competitive us packaged roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee brands such as maxwell house  yuban  and nescafe  we participate in the premium coffee market with the millstone and folgers gourmet selections ® brands as well as through sales of dunkin’ donuts retail packaged coffee products competitors include other brands such as starbucks  gevalia  eight o’clock  seattle’s best  and peet’s coffee  tea  through a manufacturing and distribution agreement with keurig we compete in the single serve coffee market with the folgers folgers gourmet selections and millstone premium coffees kcup ® products additionally we plan to launch café bustelo kcup ® packs in july 2014 kcup competitors include green mountain  starbucks  eight o’clock  maxwell house  and gevalia  as well as many private label brands we participate in the espresso coffee category with the café bustelo and café pilon brands 

in the us retail consumer foods segment the jif brand has been the leader in the peanut butter category for over 20 years competing primarily with skippy peter pan and many private label brands our natural peanut butter business sold under the jif  smucker’s  adam’s ®  and laura scudder’s ® brands maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut butter category our fruit spreads brands primarily smucker’s hold the leading position in the fruit spreads category and compete with welch’s branded line of fruit spreads and many private label brands the competing brands exist on both a national and a regional level besides the brands with which we compete in the peanut butter and fruit spreads categories our overall spreads business has been impacted by the recent growth of the hazelnut spreads category primarily nutella  crisco has historically been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories crisco holds the leading branded position in the shortening category and competes with other branded competitors for the leading branded position in the oils category the oils category in which crisco competes is highly competitive with private label competitors collectively maintaining the largest share of the category the category is also significantly impacted by volatile commodity pricing the pillsbury brand competes in the dessert baking mixes “dbm” market that includes mixes for cakes cookies brownies muffins and quick breads as well as readytospread frostings within the dbm category we compete primarily with the market leader betty crocker  as well as duncan hines and many private label and regional brands in the ingredients category pillsbury flour competes with the branded market leader gold medal  as well as many private label brands which collectively maintain the largest share of the category the hungry jack brand competes in the pancake mix and table syrup categories we compete with several major national as well as private label brands in this category we compete in the canned milk category with both branded and nonbranded products we are the branded market leader in the sweetened condensed milk category with the eagle brand and magnolia ® brands and have significant sales with production of private label brands in the evaporated milk category we have a significant presence with our production of private label brands 

in the international foodservice and natural foods segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries and compete with various brands within retail foodservice and natural foods markets 

research and development  we predominantly utilize inhouse resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of our business areas amounts expensed for research and development were 243 million 247 million and 219 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

environmental matters  we consider environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area we have implemented and manage a variety of programs including the utilization of renewable energy technology improved wastewater management increased usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee and reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce our impact on the environment and reduce waste 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2015 

 

employees  at april 30 2014 we had 4775 fulltime employees worldwide of which 26 percent located at eight facilities are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on the location with one contract expiring in 2015 we believe our relations with our employees are good 

financial information about industry segments and geographical areas  the financial information required to be included in this item concerning reportable industry segments and international operations for the years 2014 2013 and 2012 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2014 annual report to shareholders on pages 51 and 52 under “note 4 reportable segments” our international operations are primarily in canada with risks similar to those associated with the us retail markets approximately half of our 2014 canada sales represented the sale of canadian produced products to canadian customers the majority of the remaining canada sales represented the sale of products produced in the us to canadian customers primarily folgers coffee bick’s pickles and crisco oils as a result of the 2014 closure of our manufacturing facility in ste marie quebec and transition of canadian fruit spreads production to our facilities in orrville ohio and ripon wisconsin we expect that in 2015 more than half of our canada sales will represent the sale of products produced in the us to canadian customers 

forwardlooking statements  this report includes forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results the descriptions of risks and uncertainties relating to forwardlooking statements are incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2014 annual report to shareholders under the caption “forwardlooking statements” on page 34

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is generally correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

  

the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brand if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as brick packaging technology and our aromaseal tm canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

 

 we use a single national broker in the us to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

 

 we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and crisco oil products and finished goods such as kcup ® packs from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

keurig is our singlesource supplier for kcup ® packs which are used in its proprietary keurig ® kcup brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than keurig that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if keurig is unable to supply kcup ® packs to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

 we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts sweeteners edible oils fruit wheat milk and cocoa in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate 

 

due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs in addition we compete for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the biofuels industry which has resulted in increased prices for these raw materials additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products we purchase may be utilized for biofuels crops resulting in higher cost for the other agricultural products we utilize although we use basis futures and options contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs 

we expect the green coffee commodity markets to continue to be challenging due to significant ongoing price volatility for example during the first half of the 2014 calendar year drought conditions and coffee tree leaf rust fungus have affected production in key coffeeproducing regions such as brazil and central america due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

beginning in 2015 we will elect to marktomarket all of our commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives through the statement of consolidated income prior to 2015 marktomarket gains and losses on derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges were initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of this change in accounting treatment changes in the fair value of all of our derivatives will be immediately recognized in consolidated earnings resulting in increased volatility in both gross profit and net income these gains and losses will be reported in cost of products sold in our statement of consolidated income but excluded from our segment operating results and nongaap earnings until the related inventory is sold at which time the gains and losses will be reclassified to segment profit and nongaap earnings although this change more accurately aligns the derivative gains and losses with the underlying exposure being hedged within segment results we may experience more volatility in our consolidated earnings as a result of this change in accounting treatment 

 

 we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

 we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products including substantially all of our coffee fruit spreads syrups and toppings production into single manufacturing sites similarly most of our peanut butter is being produced at our facility in lexington kentucky the conversion of our facility in memphis tennessee into an additional peanut butter plant is expected to be completed during 2015 we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

 our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster work stoppage terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably as a result of our current restructuring project substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 as of april 30 2014 26 percent of our employees located at eight facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with one contract expiring in 2015 we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

 logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation including ships trucks intermodals and railcars to bring our products to market disruption to the timely supply of these 

 

services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

 

 sales to walmart stores inc and subsidiaries amounted to 27 percent of net sales in 2014 these sales are primarily included in the two us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2014 included amounts due from walmart stores inc and subsidiaries of 766 million or 25 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2014 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for 62 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and effective trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience taste consumer dietary trends and obesity health and nutritional concerns 

 

in particular consumers public health officials and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with weight management particularly among young people prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability 

 

 we are the branded market leader in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the pillsbury  dunkin’ donuts  carnation  borden  douwe egberts  or cumberland brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 

 certain of our products contain caffeine and other ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 our stated longterm strategy is to own and market leading north american food brands sold in the center of the store while maintaining a global perspective we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve the anticipated synergies and cost savings or the expected increases in revenues and operating results either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results additional potential risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities disputes with sellers and the inherent risk associated with entering a line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience 

 

 we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness our financial performance our shortterm and longterm credit ratings the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 

 a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment at april 30 2014 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 61 billion compared to total assets of approximately 91 billion and total shareholders’ equity of approximately 50 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this could result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life crisco has historically been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories in recent years however crisco sales volume has been impacted by substantial price competition with private label offerings volatile commodity prices and a decline in the shortening category the estimated fair value of the crisco trademark decreased approximately 70 million or 4 percent from 2013 to 2014 we anticipate modest longterm growth for the crisco business due to the competitive landscape of the cooking oils category and assumed a longterm growth rate of 25 percent for the 2014 annual impairment test of our indefinitelived trademarks a sensitivity analysis was performed on the crisco trademark assuming a hypothetical 50basispoint increase in the discount rate and a 50basispoint decrease in the expected longterm growth rate which yielded an estimated fair value slightly below carrying value the crisco brand continues to be important to the company and we continue to focus on its longterm health however if recent trends continue the longterm assumptions relative to growth rates and profitability of the crisco brand may not be attained which could result in an impairment of the crisco trademark 

 

  

our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients including whether a product contains genetically modified ingredients packaging advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 

 in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

 while scientific consensus on the existence potential causes or likely outcomes of global climate change has not yet been reached researchers continue to aggressively explore this issue there already exists significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts sweeteners edible oils wheat milk cocoa and various fruits and vegetables we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result 

 

of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

 

 we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics finance and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure whether due to attacks by hackers employee error or other causes can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

in addition we have outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions including accounts payable processing benefit plan administration and other functions to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

 item 1 business 

the company  the j m smucker company “company” “registrant” “we” “us” or “our” was established in 1897 was incorporated in ohio in 1921 and is often referred to as smucker’s a registered trademark we operate principally in one industry the manufacturing and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis although the majority of our sales are in the us our operations outside the us are principally in canada although products are exported to other countries as well net sales outside the us represented approximately 9 percent of consolidated net sales for 2013 our branded food products include a strong portfolio of trusted iconic marketleading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in north america 

on november 6 2008 we completed a merger transaction with the folgers coffee company “folgers” a subsidiary of the procter  gamble company “pg” the value of the transaction was approximately 37 billion including the issuance of common shares of the company in connection with the merger and 350 million of folgers debt under the terms of the transaction agreements pg distributed common shares of folgers to participating pg shareholders which were then automatically converted into the right to receive common shares of the company in the merger immediately following the merger pg shareholders and premerger company shareholders owned approximately 535 percent and 465 percent respectively of the company’s approximately 118 million common shares outstanding the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination and we were treated as the acquiring entity 

we have three reportable segments us retail coffee us retail consumer foods and international foodservice and natural foods the two us retail market segments in total comprised over 75 percent of consolidated net sales in 2013 and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in north america the international foodservice and natural foods segment represents sales outside of the us retail markets and has grown over the past year primarily due to the full year contribution from the acquisition of the majority of the north american foodservice coffee and hot beverage business from sara lee corporation in january 2012 

principal products  our principal products are coffee peanut butter fruit spreads shortening and oils baking mixes and readytospread frostings canned milk flour and baking ingredients juices and beverages frozen sandwiches toppings syrups and pickles and condiments 

product sales information for the years 2013 2012 and 2011 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2013 annual report to shareholders on pages 53 through 55 under “note 5 reportable segments” 

in both of the us retail market segments our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers food wholesalers drug stores club stores mass merchandisers discount and dollar stores and military commissaries in the international foodservice and natural foods segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels foodservice distributors and operators eg restaurants lodging schools and universities health care operators and health and natural foods stores and distributors 

sources and availability of raw materials  the raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agriculturalbased products green coffee peanuts edible oils sweeteners milk flour corn and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers the availability quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate over time basis futures and options contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs green coffee is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price are subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather global supply and demand pest damage 

  

investor speculation and political and economic conditions in the source countries fruit and vegetable raw materials used in the production of our food products are purchased from independent growers and suppliers the principal packaging materials we use are glass plastic steel cans caps carton board and corrugate 

raw materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to longterm contracts while availability may vary yeartoyear we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to singlesourced materials are available we have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials we consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be good 

trademarks and patents  our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries our major trademarks are listed below 

 

 dunkin’ donuts is a registered trademark of dd ip holder llc used under license the “dunkin’ license” for packaged coffee products sold in retail channels such as grocery stores mass merchandisers club stores and drug stores the dunkin’ license does not pertain to dunkin’ donuts coffee or other products for sale in dunkin’ donuts restaurants the terms of the dunkin’ license include the payment of royalties to dd ip holder llc and other financial commitments by the company the dunkin’ license is in effect until january 1 2034 

pillsbury  the barrelhead logo and the doughboy character are trademarks of the pillsbury company llc and are used under a 20year perpetually renewable royaltyfree license 

borden and the elsie design are trademarks used on certain products under a perpetual exclusive and royaltyfree license carnation is a trademark of société des produits nestlé sa used by our canadian subsidiary for certain canned milk products in certain territories under an exclusive and royaltyfree license with an initial term of 10 years renewable for two successive 5year terms and which becomes perpetual at the end of the renewal terms under certain circumstances douwe egberts ® and pickwick ® are registered trademarks of de master blenders 1753 nv and are used under a multiyear license in accordance with a multiyear licensing and distribution agreement entered into with cumberland packing corp “cumberland” beginning in july 2013 we will market and distribute cumberland’s branded tabletop sweeteners sold under the sweet‘n low ®  natrataste ®  sugar in the raw ®  and other “in the raw” brands to foodservice customers in the us and to retail and foodservice customers in canada in addition we and our subsidiaries license the use of several other trademarks none of which are individually material to our business 

slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include without limitation “with a name like smucker’s it has to be good ® ” “the best part of wakin’ up is folgers in your cup ® ” “mountain grown design” “choosy moms choose jif ® ” “purely the finest ® ” “crisco is cooking™” “everybody’s happy when it’s hungry jack ® ” “goodness gracious it’s good ® ” the smucker’s banner the crock jar shape the gingham design and the strawberry logo 

  

we own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered 

we consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property taken as a whole to be essential to our business 

seasonality  the us retail coffee and us retail consumer foods segments are particularly seasonal around the “fall bake” and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters our success in promoting and merchandising our baking and coffee brands during the “fall bake” and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year the backtoschool period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods although their impact is not as significant as the “fall bake” and holiday period 

working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee oil and baking inventories necessary to support the “fall bake” and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season 

customers  sales to walmart stores inc and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2013 2012 or 2011 

during 2013 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 63 percent of consolidated net sales although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands 

orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

government business  no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

competition  we are the branded market leader in the coffee peanut butter fruit spreads shortening sweetened condensed milk ice cream toppings and natural foods beverages categories in the us in canada we are the branded market leader in the flour pickles canned milk fruit spreads shortening and ice cream toppings categories our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products 

the continued growth of alternative store formats product and packaging innovations technological advances and new industry techniques need to be considered by companies in the food industry in order to remain competitive the primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience advertising and promotion positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include wellrecognized brands superior product quality and trust experienced brand and category management a single national grocery broker in the us varied product offerings product innovation good customer service and an integrated distribution network 

accelerated private label growth is typically seen during periods of general economic disruption most recently during the period following the economic recession of the late 2000’s it was estimated that private label grew more than during past periods partly due to the run up in commodity costs increased emphasis of store brands by retailers and improvements in private label quality we believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food categories in which we compete appealing to different consumer segments we closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that 1 brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

  

in the us retail coffee segment the folgers brand competes in the highly competitive us packaged roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee brands such as maxwell house  yuban  and nescafe  we participate in the premium coffee market with the millstone and folgers gourmet selections ® brands as well as through sales of dunkin’ donuts retail packaged coffee products competitors include other brands such as starbucks  gevalia  eight o’clock  seattle’s best  and peet’s coffee  tea  through a manufacturing and distribution agreement with green mountain coffee roasters inc “green mountain” and keurig inc we compete in the single serve coffee market with the folgers gourmet selections and millstone premium coffees kcup ® products kcup competitors include green mountain  starbucks  eight o’clock  maxwell house  and gevalia  as well as many private label brands we participate in the espresso coffee category with the café bustelo and café pilon brands 

in the us retail consumer foods segment the jif brand has been the leader in the peanut butter category for over 20 years competing primarily with skippy peter pan and many private label brands our natural peanut butter business sold under the jif  smucker’s  adam’s  and laura scudder’s brands maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut butter category our fruit spread brands primarily smucker’s hold the leading position in the fruit spreads category and compete with welch’s branded line of fruit spreads and many private label brands the competing brands exist on both a national and a regional level crisco has historically been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories crisco holds the leading branded position in the shortening category and competes with other branded competitors for the leading branded position in the oils category the oils category in which crisco competes is highly competitive with private label competitors maintaining the largest share of the category the category is also significantly impacted by volatile commodity pricing the pillsbury brand competes in the dessert and baking mixes “dbm” market that includes mixes for cakes cookies brownies muffins and quick breads as well as readytospread frostings and ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour within the dbm category we compete primarily with the betty crocker and duncan hines brands and many private label and regional brands the hungry jack brand competes in the pancake mix and table syrup category we compete with several major national as well as private label brands in this category we compete in the canned milk category with both branded and nonbranded products we are the branded market leader in the sweetened condensed milk category with the eagle brand and magnolia ® brands and have significant sales with production of private label brands in the evaporated milk category we have a significant presence with our production of private label brands 

in the international foodservice and natural foods segment our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries and compete with various brands within retail foodservice and natural foods markets 

research and development  we predominantly utilize inhouse resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of our business areas amounts expensed for research and development were 247 million 219 million and 210 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

environmental matters  we consider environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area we have implemented and manage a variety of programs including the utilization of renewable energy technology improved wastewater management increased usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee and reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce our impact on the environment and reduce waste 

compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal state and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position in 2014 

  

employees  at april 30 2013 we had approximately 4875 fulltime employees worldwide approximately 28 percent of these employees located at nine facilities are covered by union contracts these contracts vary in term depending on the location with four contracts expiring in 2014 we believe our relations with our employees are good 

financial information about industry segments and geographical areas  the financial information required to be included in this item concerning reportable industry segments and international operations for the years 2013 2012 and 2011 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2013 annual report to shareholders on pages 53 through 55 under “note 5 reportable segments” our international operations are primarily in canada with risks similar to those associated with the us retail markets approximately onehalf of our canada sales represent the sale of canadian produced products to canadian customers the majority of the remaining canada sales represent the sale of products produced in the us to canadian customers primarily folgers coffee bick’s pickles and crisco oils 

forwardlooking statements  this report includes forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or projected results the descriptions of risks and uncertainties relating to forwardlooking statements is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our 2013 annual report to shareholders under the caption “forwardlooking statements” on page 36 

available information  access to all of our securities and exchange commission “sec” filings including our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is provided free of charge on our website smuckerscominvestors as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the sec in connection with evaluating the company our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect us the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we operate in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is generally correlated to population growth our success depends in part on our ability to grow our brands faster than the population in general we consider our ability to build and sustain the equity of our brands critical to our market share growth if we do not succeed in these efforts our market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

 the success of our business depends significantly on our brands knowhow and other intellectual property we rely on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property the success of our growth strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brand if our efforts to 

  

protect our intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we are engaged in litigation to protect our intellectual property which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular we consider our proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of our coffee products and therefore essential to our coffee brands because many of the roasting methods we use are not protected by patents it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods if such methods become known we also believe that our packaging innovations such as brick packaging technology and our aromaseal tm canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if our competitors copy our roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of our coffee brands may be diminished and we could lose customers to our competitors 

 

 we use a single national broker to represent a portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade our business would suffer disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect our business 

 

 we have elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for our folgers coffee products as well as our jif peanut butter and crisco oil products and finished goods such as kcups  from single sources of supply while we believe that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 

green mountain is our singlesource supplier for kcups which are used in green mountain’s proprietary keurig ® kcup brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than green mountain that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if green mountain is unable to supply kcups to us for any reason it could be difficult to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

 we and our business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of our products including green coffee peanuts sweeteners edible oils fruit wheat milk and cocoa in addition we and our business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute our products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters currency fluctuations investor speculation trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs for example during 2012 costs to acquire peanuts increased in part due to adverse weather conditions in addition we compete for certain 

  

 we expect the green coffee commodity markets to continue to be challenging due to significant ongoing price volatility due to the significance of green coffee to our coffee business combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of our derivative position at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities if we fail to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if we institute a position and costs subsequently decrease our costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than our competitors’ costs and our financial results could be adversely affected in addition our liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

 

 we may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to our customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect our results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of our branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward our lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

 we have consolidated our production capacity for certain products including substantially all of our coffee production into single manufacturing sites in addition we are close to completing our plan to further consolidate our fruit spreads syrups and toppings production as part of our current restructuring project we could experience a production disruption at these or any of our manufacturing sites resulting in a reduction or elimination of the availability of some of our products if we are not able to obtain alternate production capability in a timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

 our ability and the ability of our thirdparty suppliers and service providers distributors and contract manufacturers to manufacture distribute and sell products is critical to our success a significant interruption in the operation of any of our manufacturing or distribution capabilities or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers distributors or contract manufacturers or a service failure by a thirdparty service provider whether as a result of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster terrorism pandemic illness or other causes could significantly impair our ability to operate our business notably as a result of our current restructuring project substantially all of our coffee production takes place in new orleans louisiana which is subject to risks associated with hurricane and other weatherrelated events failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or to effectively manage such events if they occur could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 as of april 30 2013 approximately 28 percent of our employees located at nine facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements these contracts vary in term depending on location with four contracts expiring in 2014 we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements or as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements with labor unions our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

 logistics and other transportationrelated costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations we use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market they include ships trucks intermodals and railcars disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability or cost of fuel regulations affecting the industry labor shortages in the transportation industry service failures by thirdparty service providers accidents or natural disasters which may impact the transportation infrastructure or demand for transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims our operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding our products as well as our competitors’ products in the event of product contamination or tampering we may need to recall some of our products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either us or our competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in our food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of our brands materially impacting consumer demand 

  

 sales to walmart stores inc and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2013 these sales are primarily included in the two us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2013 included amounts due from walmart stores inc and its subsidiaries of approximately 920 million or approximately 29 percent of the total trade receivables balance during 2013 our top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 63 percent of consolidated net sales we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price promotional support product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of our products additionally our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us which could adversely affect our results of operations a reduction in sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 we face competition across our product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and effective trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of our competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products in order to generate future revenues and profits we must continue to sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact us and the food industry as a whole including convenience taste consumer dietary trends and obesity health and nutritional concerns 

in particular consumers public health officials and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with weight management particularly among young people prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of our products and adversely affect our profitability 

  

 we hold the 1 branded leadership position in several categories both in the us and canada we believe that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if we fail to preserve the quality of our products if we are perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or our brands otherwise receive negative publicity if our brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if our products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared if our brand values are diminished our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the pillsbury  dunkin’ donuts  carnation  borden  or cumberland brands could adversely affect the success of our exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 

 certain of our products contain caffeine and other ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other ingredients present in our products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our products 

we may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect us regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 our stated longterm strategy is to own and market leading north american food brands sold in the center of the store while maintaining a global perspective we have historically made strategic acquisitions of brands and businesses and intend to do so in the future in support of this strategy if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including the expected increases in revenues and operating results any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results additional potential risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns additional debt leverage the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business the assumption of unknown liabilities disputes with sellers and the inherent risk associated with entering a line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience 

 

 we have periodically commenced restructuring initiatives with the expectation of realizing future benefits including operational efficiencies or cost savings the future benefits we expect from restructuring initiatives may not be realized during the time period expected or at all due to unforeseen or changing business conditions in addition costs incurred to realize the future benefits may be higher than anticipated and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

   

we may need new or additional financing in the future to conduct our operations expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness our financial performance our shortterm and longterm credit ratings the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food and beverage industry may make credit and capital markets more difficult for us to access even though we have an established revolving credit facility from time to time we have relied and also may rely in the future on access to financial markets as a source of liquidity for working capital requirements acquisitions and general corporate purposes in particular our access to funds under our revolving credit facility is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to that facility to meet their funding commitments the obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facility are several and not joint and as a result a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others in addition longterm volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation of financial institutions reduced alternatives or failure of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our businesses in the longer term such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged disruptions in the capital and credit markets could also result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased costs under credit facilities continuation of these disruptions would increase our interest expense and capital costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

 

 a significant portion of our assets is goodwill and other intangible assets the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment at april 30 2013 the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately 61 billion compared to total assets of approximately 90 billion and total shareholders’ equity of approximately 51 billion if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current estimated fair value the asset is considered impaired and this could result in a noncash charge to earnings any such impairment charge would reduce earnings and could be material events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares increased competition or loss of market share obsolescence or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life crisco has historically been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories in recent years however crisco sales volume has declined primarily due to substantial price competition with private label offerings volatile commodity prices and a decline in the shortening category the crisco brand continues to be important to the company and we continue to focus on its longterm health however if recent trends continue the longterm assumptions relative to growth rates and profitability of the crisco brand may not be attained which could result in an impairment of the crisco trademark 

 

 our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal state and local government agencies in the us as well as to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold in particular the manufacturing marketing packaging labeling and distribution of food products are each subject to governmental regulation that is increasingly extensive encompassing such matters as ingredients packaging advertising relations with distributors and retailers health safety and the environment additionally we are routinely subject to new or modified tax and securities regulations other laws and regulations and accounting and reporting standards 

  

in the us we are required to comply with federal laws such as the food drug and cosmetic act the occupational safety and health act the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act laws governing equal employment opportunity and various other federal statutes and regulations we are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations for instance the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in the state of california that contains a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects this law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement if we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold as a result of proposition 65 sales of those products could suffer not only in those locations but elsewhere 

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase our production costs or adversely affect our sales of certain products in addition our failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject us to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 

 in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery or anticorruption laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

 while scientific consensus on the existence potential causes or likely outcomes of global climate change has not yet been reached researchers continue to aggressively explore this issue 

however there already exists significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as green coffee peanuts sweeteners edible oils wheat milk cocoa and various fruits and vegetables we may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of facilities or the operation of our supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations we may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase our operating distribution or supply chain costs we could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position 

  

 we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure to effectively manage our business data supply chain logistics accounting and other business processes and for digital marketing activities and electronic communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure or we do not effectively implement system upgrades our business or financial results could be negatively impacted in particular we are undertaking a significant upgrade of our enterprise resource planning systems with an anticipated completion during the first quarter of 2014 if we do not effectively manage this upgrade our business or financial results could be negatively impacted while we have robust plans in place to ensure success contingencies have been developed to address potential business disruption including postponement of the upgrade security breaches or system failures of our infrastructure can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches or failures our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

in addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as accounts payable processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs in connection with such failure to perform depending on the function involved such failures may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise

the company historically has seen accelerated private label growth during periods of general economic disruption the company estimates that during the period following the economic recession of the late 2000’s private label grew more than during past periods partly due to the run up in commodity costs increased emphasis of store brands by retailers and improvements in private label quality the company believes that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food categories in which it competes appealing to different consumer segments the company closely monitors the price gap or price premium between its brands and private label brands with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company’s business operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties the risk factors described below should be carefully considered together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report and in the company’s other filings with 

  

the sec in connection with evaluating the company its business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may affect the company the occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the company faces competition across its product lines from other food companies with the primary methods and factors in competition being product quality price packaging product innovation nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion continued success is dependent on product innovation the ability to secure and maintain adequate retail shelf space and effective trade merchandising advertising and marketing programs some of the company’s competitors have substantial financial marketing and other resources and competition with them in the company’s various markets and product lines could cause the company to reduce prices increase marketing or other expenditures or lose category share category share and growth could be adversely impacted if the company is not successful in introducing new products in order to generate future revenues and profits the company must continue to sell products that appeal to its customers and consumers specifically there are a number of trends in consumer preferences that may impact the company and the food industry as a whole including convenience taste consumer dietary trends and obesity health and nutritional concerns 

in particular consumers public health officials and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with weight management particularly among young people prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of the company’s products and marketing programs although the company strives to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations it may not be successful in these efforts increasing public concern regarding health issues and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for certain of the company’s products and adversely affect the company’s profitability 

 

 the company believes that maintaining and continually enhancing the value of its brands is critical to the success of its business brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on the company’s ability to provide highquality products brand value could diminish significantly as a result of a number of factors such as if the company fails to preserve the quality of its products if the company is perceived to act in an irresponsible manner if the company or its brands otherwise receive negative publicity if the brands fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience or if the products become unavailable to consumers the growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared if the company’s brand values are diminished the company’s revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected in addition anything that harms the pillsbury  carnation  borden  or dunkin’ donuts brands could adversely affect the success of the company’s exclusive licensing agreements with the owners of these brands 

 

 the food industry is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination product tampering product recall and consumer product liability claims the company’s operations could be impacted by both genuine and fictitious claims regarding the company’s and its competitors’ 

  

products in the event of product contamination or tampering the company may need to recall some of its products a widespread product recall could result in significant loss due to the cost of conducting a product recall including destruction of inventory and the loss of sales resulting from the unavailability of product for a period of time the company could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against it a significant product recall or a product liability judgment involving either the company or its competitors could also result in a loss of consumer confidence in the company’s food products or the food category and an actual or perceived loss of value of the company’s brands materially impacting consumer demand 

 

 certain of the company’s products contain caffeine and other ingredients the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny including the suggestion that consumption may have adverse health effects an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other ingredients present in the company’s products product recalls or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks could significantly reduce the demand for the company’s products 

the company may also be subject to complaints from or litigation by consumers who allege food and beveragerelated illness or other quality health or operational concerns adverse publicity resulting from such allegations could materially adversely affect the company regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether the company is ultimately held liable a lawsuit or claim could result in an adverse decision against the company which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the company operates in the competitive food industry whose growth potential is generally correlated to population growth the company’s success depends in part on its ability to grow its brands faster than the population in general the company considers its ability to build and sustain the equity of its brands critical to its market share growth if the company does not succeed in these efforts its market share growth may slow which could have a material impact on its results of operations 

 

 the success of the company’s business depends significantly on its brands knowhow and other intellectual property the company relies on a combination of trademarks service marks trade secrets patents copyrights and similar rights to protect its intellectual property the success of the company’s growth strategy depends on its continued ability to use its existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop its brand if the company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property are not adequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on its intellectual property the value of the company’s brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on its business from time to time the company is engaged in litigation to protect its intellectual property which could result in substantial costs to the company as well as diversion of management attention 

in particular the company considers its proprietary coffee roasting methods essential to the consistent flavor and richness of its coffee products and therefore essential to its coffee brands because many of the roasting methods used by the company are not protected by patents it may be difficult for the company to prevent competitors from copying its roasting methods if such methods become known the company also believes that its packaging innovations such as brick packaging technology and its aromaseal tm canisters are important to the coffee business’ marketing and operational efforts if the company’s competitors copy its roasting or packaging methods or develop more advanced roasting or packaging methods the value of the company’s coffee brands may be diminished and the company could lose customers to its competitors 

  

 the company uses a single national broker to represent a significant portion of branded products to the retail grocery trade the company’s business would suffer substantial disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent the company to the retail grocery trade which could adversely affect the company’s business 

 

 sales to walmart stores inc and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately 26 percent of the company’s net sales in 2012 these sales are primarily included in the two us retail market segments trade receivables at april 30 2012 included amounts due from walmart stores inc and its subsidiaries of approximately 841 million during 2012 the company’s top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers in particular retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which the company can rely for business consolidation also produces large more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products the company’s customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from the company these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price product quality consumer demand customer service performance their desired inventory levels and other factors changes in customers’ strategies including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products may adversely affect sales customers also may respond to price increases by reducing distribution resulting in reduced sales of the company’s products additionally the company’s customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from the company which could adversely affect results of operations if sales of products to one or more major customers are reduced this reduction could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the company has elected to source certain raw materials such as packaging for its most popular folgers coffee products as well as its jif peanut butter and crisco oil products and finished goods such as kcups  from single sources of supply while the company believes that except as set forth below alternative sources of these raw materials and finished goods could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms loss or an extended interruption in supplies from a singlesource supplier would result in additional costs could have a disruptive shortterm effect on the company’s business and could adversely affect its results of operations 

green mountain is the company’s singlesource supplier for kcups which are used in green mountain’s proprietary keurig ® kcup brewing system there are a limited number of manufacturers other than green mountain that are making cups that will work in such proprietary brewing system if green mountain is unable to supply kcups to the company for any reason it could be difficult for the company to find an alternative supplier for such goods on commercially reasonable terms which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

 the company and its business partners purchase and use large quantities of many different commodities and agricultural products in the manufacturing of the company’s products including green coffee peanuts sweeteners edible oils fruit wheat milk and cocoa in addition the company and its business partners utilize significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package the company’s products and natural gas and fuel oil to manufacture package and distribute the company’s products the prices of these commodities agricultural products and other materials are subject to volatility and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global supply and demand commodity market fluctuations crop sizes and yield fluctuations weather natural disasters currency fluctuations speculative influences trade agreements political unrest consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs for example during 2012 costs to acquire peanuts increased in part due to adverse weather conditions although the company utilizes forward contracts and commodity futures and option contracts to manage commodity price volatility in some instances commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in the company’s raw material and energy costs 

in addition the price of green coffee has been subject to significant volatility over the last two years in early may 2011 green coffee commodity prices reached a 34year high at a level approximately 50 percent higher than they were eight months earlier and over 125 percent higher than they were a year earlier the company expects the green coffee commodity market to continue to be challenging due to the significance of green coffee to the companys coffee business combined with the companys ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities significant increases or decreases in the cost of green coffee could have an adverse impact on the companys profitability in addition if the company is not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage the company may not be able to fulfill the demand for its coffee which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 the company may not be able to pass some or all of any increases in the price of raw materials energy and other input costs to its customers by raising prices to the extent competitors do not also increase their prices customers and consumers may choose to purchase competing products or may shift purchases to private label or other lowerpriced offerings which may adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price differential for the company’s branded products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings and may forego some purchases altogether especially during economic downturns retailers may also increase levels of promotional activity for lowerpriced offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes during times of economic uncertainty accordingly sales volumes of the company’s branded products could be reduced or lead to a shift in sales mix toward its lowermargin offerings as a result decreased demand for the company’s products may adversely affect its results of operations 

 

   

the company uses derivative instruments including commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases the extent of the company’s derivative position at any given time depends on the company’s assessment of the markets for these commodities if the company fails to take a derivative position and costs subsequently increase or if it institutes a position and costs subsequently decrease the company’s costs may be greater than anticipated or higher than its competitors’ costs and financial results could be adversely affected in addition the company’s liquidity may be adversely impacted by the cash margin requirements of the commodities exchanges or the failure of a counterparty to perform in accordance with a contract 

 

 the company competes for certain raw materials notably corn and soybased agricultural products with the emerging biofuels industry growth in the biofuels industry which is typically linked to increases in gasoline and diesel prices may limit the supply of certain raw materials available to the company additionally farm acreage currently devoted to other agricultural products utilized by the company may be converted to corn or soy resulting in higher cost for other agricultural products utilized by the company

complying with new regulations and laws or changes to existing regulations and laws or their application could increase the companys production costs or adversely affect the companys sales of certain products in addition the company’s failure or inability to comply with applicable regulations and laws could subject the company to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as potential criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and financial condition

 while scientific consensus on the existence potential causes or likely outcomes of global climate change has not yet been reached researchers continue to aggressively explore this issue however there already exists significant political and scientific concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate the emission of such greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity the company may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for its products such as green coffee peanuts sweeteners edible oils wheat milk cocoa and various fruits and vegetables the company may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change which could impact its manufacturing and distribution operations in addition natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of facilities or the operation of the company’s supply chain 

increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases in the event that such regulations are enacted and are more rigorous than existing regulations the company may experience significant increases in costs of operation and delivery in particular increased regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or suppliers could substantially increase the company’s operating distribution or supply chain costs the company could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change as a result climate change could negatively affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position

  seasonality  the company’s us retail oils and baking market and us retail coffee market businesses are particularly seasonal around the “fall bake” and holiday period which generally results in higher sales and profits in the company’s second and third quarters the company’s success in promoting and merchandising its baking and coffee brands during the “fall bake” and holiday period has a significant impact on its results for a fiscal year the backtoschool period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods for the company although their impact to the company is not as significant as the “fall bake” and holiday period 

  working capital  working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of the company’s fiscal year mainly due to the timing of fruit and vegetable procurement the buildup of oil baking and coffee inventories necessary to support the “fall bake” and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the atlantic hurricane season 

  customers  sales to walmart stores inc and its subsidiaries amounted to approximately 24 percent 20 percent and 20 percent of net sales in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these sales are primarily included in the us retail market segments no other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2009 2008 and 2007 

during 2009 the company’s top 10 customers collectively accounted for approximately 61 percent of consolidated net sales reflecting consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years the company expects industry consolidation to continue although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact the company’s sales and profits the company does not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for the company’s products 

  orders  generally orders are filled within a few days of receipt and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis 

  government business  no material portion of the company’s business is subject to negotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government 

  competition  the company is the branded market leader in the coffee peanut butter shortening and oils sweetened condensed milk fruit spreads dessert toppings and health and natural foods beverages categories the company’s business is highly competitive as all of its us retail market segments’ brands compete for retail shelf space with other advertised and branded products as well as unadvertised and private label products 

the continued growth of alternative store formats product and packaging innovations technological advances and new industry techniques are all issues for companies in the food industry to consider in order to remain competitive the primary ways in which products are distinguished are product quality price packaging new product introductions nutritional value convenience customer service advertising and promotion positive factors pertaining to the company’s competitive position include wellrecognized brands superior product quality experienced brand management a single national grocery broker in the united states varied product offerings product innovation and a strong distribution network 

the company historically has seen accelerated private label growth during challenging economic times during 2009 private label gained share of market in most categories within the grocery store in which the company competes the company estimates that during the current economic recession private label has grown more than during past recessions partly due to the unprecedented run up in commodity costs combined with improvements in private label quality the company believes that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food categories in which it competes appealing to different consumer segments the company closely monitors the price gap or price premium between its brands and private label with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets 

in the consumer segment the jif® brand has been a leader in the peanut butter category for over 20 years while the company’s natural peanut butter business sold under the smucker’s®  adam’s®  and laura scudder’s® brands maintains a strong leadership position in the natural peanut butter category the company’s fruit spread brands including smucker’s® dickinson’s®  and knott’s berry farm® hold the leading position in the fruit spreads category and compete with welch’s branded line of fruit spreads and many private label brands the competing brands exist on both a national and a regional level the company’s hungry jack® brand competes in three primary market categories pancake mix potato side 

dishes and table syrup the company competes with several major national as well as private label brands in these categories 

in the oils and baking segment crisco® has been a leader in the shortening and cooking oils categories for over 50 years crisco® holds a leading position among branded competitors in both the oils and shortening categories the oils category in which crisco® competes is a more competitive category due to a significant private label presence and volatile commodity pricing the company’s pillsbury® brand competes in the dessert and baking mixes “dbm” market that includes mixes for cakes cookies brownies muffins and quick breads as well as readytospread frostings and ingredients used in scratch baking such as flour within the dbm category the company competes primarily with the betty crocker and duncan hines brands and many private label brands the company competes in the canned milk category with both branded and nonbranded products the company is the branded market leader in the sweetened condensed category with over 50 percent market share with its eagle brand® and magnolia® brands and has significant sales with production of private label brands in the evaporated milk category the company has a significant presence with its production of private label brands and the pet® brand where it competes primarily with one major national brand 

in the coffee segment the folgers® brand competes in the highly competitive us packaged roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee roasters such as maxwell house yuban general foods international coffee starbucks and seattle’s best and others the company also competes in the premium gourmet coffee market through its millstone®  folgers gourmet selections® brands as well as through sales of dunkin’ donuts® licensed retail packaged coffee products the company’s coffee business also faces competition from the specialty or gourmet awayfromhome coffee market a significant market in the coffee industry and a market in which the company does not compete
